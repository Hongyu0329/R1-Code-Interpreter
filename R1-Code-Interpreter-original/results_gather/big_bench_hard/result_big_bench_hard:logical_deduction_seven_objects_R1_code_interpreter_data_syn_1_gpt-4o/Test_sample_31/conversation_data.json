  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ada, Amy, Rob, Mya, and Mel. Ada finished below Amy. Joe finished below Dan. Dan finished below Ada. Mel finished third-to-last. Amy finished third. Rob finished below Mya.\nOptions:\n(A) Joe finished third\n(B) Dan finished third\n(C) Ada finished third\n(D) Amy finished third\n(E) Rob finished third\n(F) Mya finished third\n(G) Mel finished third\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Ada finished below Amy.\n2. Joe finished below Dan.\n3. Dan finished below Ada.\n4. Mel finished third-to-last.\n5. Amy finished third.\n6. Rob finished below Mya.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- Since Amy finished third, we have: `___, ___, Amy, ___, ___, Mel, ___`.\n- Mel is third-to-last, so Mel is in the 5th position.\n- Ada is below Amy, so Ada cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position.\n- Dan is below Ada, so Dan cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position either.\n- Joe is below Dan, so Joe cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th position.\n- Rob is below Mya, so Rob cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th position.\n\nLet's use Python to find the correct order of the golfers:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ngolfers = ['Joe', 'Dan', 'Ada', 'Amy', 'Rob', 'Mya', 'Mel']\nconstraints = [\n    lambda order: order.index('Amy') == 2,  # Amy finished third\n    lambda order: order.index('Mel') == 4,  # Mel finished third-to-last\n    lambda order: order.index('Ada') > order.index('Amy'),  # Ada below Amy\n    lambda order: order.index('Joe') > order.index('Dan'),  # Joe below Dan\n    lambda order: order.index('Dan') > order.index('Ada'),  # Dan below Ada\n    lambda order: order.index('Rob') > order.index('Mya')  # Rob below Mya\n]\n\nfor order in permutations(golfers):\n    if all(constraint(order) for constraint in constraints):\n        print(order)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find the correct order of the golfers based on the constraints. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "Based on the code output, the order of the golfers is:\n\n1. Mya\n2. Rob\n3. Amy\n4. Ada\n5. Mel\n6. Dan\n7. Joe\n\nFrom this order, we can see that Amy finished third. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D) Amy finished third>>>"
