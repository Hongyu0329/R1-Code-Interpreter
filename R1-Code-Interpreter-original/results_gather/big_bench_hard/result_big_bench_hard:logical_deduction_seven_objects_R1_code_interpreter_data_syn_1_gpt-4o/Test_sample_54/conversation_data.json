  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eli, Ada, Amy, Ana, Eve, Mel, and Dan. Ada finished above Mel. Dan finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Ana finished third-to-last. Dan finished below Eli. Eve finished third.\nOptions:\n(A) Eli finished fourth\n(B) Ada finished fourth\n(C) Amy finished fourth\n(D) Ana finished fourth\n(E) Eve finished fourth\n(F) Mel finished fourth\n(G) Dan finished fourth\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Ada finished above Mel.\n2. Dan finished above Ada.\n3. Amy finished last.\n4. Ana finished third-to-last.\n5. Dan finished below Eli.\n6. Eve finished third.\n\nWe need to find out who finished fourth. Let's start by placing the golfers based on the given information:\n\n- Amy is 7th (last).\n- Ana is 5th (third-to-last).\n- Eve is 3rd.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining golfers: Eli, Ada, Mel, and Dan.\n\n- Ada finished above Mel, so Ada is not 6th.\n- Dan finished above Ada, so Dan is not 6th or 5th.\n- Dan finished below Eli, so Eli is not 6th or 5th.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining golfers:\n\n1. Eli\n2. Dan\n3. Eve\n4. ?\n5. Ana\n6. Mel\n7. Amy\n\nSince Ada must be above Mel and below Dan, Ada can only be 4th. Let's verify this by checking all conditions:\n\n- Ada is above Mel (Ada is 4th, Mel is 6th).\n- Dan is above Ada (Dan is 2nd, Ada is 4th).\n- Dan is below Eli (Eli is 1st, Dan is 2nd).\n- Eve is 3rd.\n- Ana is 5th.\n- Amy is 7th.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with Ada in 4th place. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B) Ada finished fourth>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
