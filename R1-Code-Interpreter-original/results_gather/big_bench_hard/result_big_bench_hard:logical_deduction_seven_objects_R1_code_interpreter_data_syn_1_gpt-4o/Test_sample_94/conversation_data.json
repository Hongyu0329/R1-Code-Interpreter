    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven golfers based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Rob finished second.\n2. Rob finished above Eve.\n3. Joe finished above Ada.\n4. Joe finished below Eve.\n5. Ada finished above Ana.\n6. Eli finished third-to-last.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can start placing the golfers in order:\n\n- Since Rob finished second, we have: _ Rob _ _ _ _ _\n\n- Rob finished above Eve, so Eve cannot be first or second. Since Rob is second, Eve must be third or later.\n\n- Joe finished above Ada, so Joe cannot be last. Joe finished below Eve, so Joe must be fourth or later.\n\n- Ada finished above Ana, so Ada cannot be last. Ana must be last or second-to-last.\n\n- Eli finished third-to-last, which means Eli is fifth.\n\nLet's try to place the golfers:\n\n1. _ (not Rob, Eve, Joe, Eli)\n2. Rob\n3. Eve (since Rob is above Eve and Joe is below Eve)\n4. Joe (since Joe is above Ada and below Eve)\n5. Eli (third-to-last)\n6. Ada (since Ada is above Ana)\n7. Ana\n\nNow, let's fill in the first position:\n\n- The only golfer left is Amy, so Amy must be first.\n\nThe final order is: Amy, Rob, Eve, Joe, Eli, Ada, Ana.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) Ada finished second - False\n(B) Amy finished second - False\n(C) Eli finished second - False\n(D) Rob finished second - True\n(E) Joe finished second - False\n(F) Eve finished second - False\n(G) Ana finished second - False\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Rob finished second.\n\n<<<D>>>"
