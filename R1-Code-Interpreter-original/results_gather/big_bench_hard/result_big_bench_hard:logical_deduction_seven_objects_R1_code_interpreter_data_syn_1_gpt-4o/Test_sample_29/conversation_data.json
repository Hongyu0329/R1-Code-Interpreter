    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions and try to arrange the books accordingly:\n\n1. There are seven books: blue, yellow, brown, gray, green, purple, and orange.\n2. The blue book is to the right of the brown book.\n3. The gray book is the rightmost.\n4. The purple book is to the left of the green book.\n5. The green book is to the left of the yellow book.\n6. The brown book is the second from the left.\n7. The purple book is to the right of the blue book.\n\nLet's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- Since the gray book is the rightmost, it must be in position 7.\n- The brown book is second from the left, so it is in position 2.\n- The blue book is to the right of the brown book, so it cannot be in position 1 or 2.\n- The purple book is to the right of the blue book, so it must be further right than the blue book.\n- The purple book is to the left of the green book, so the green book must be further right than the purple book.\n- The green book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book must be further right than the green book.\n\nLet's try to arrange the books using these constraints:\n\n1. [ ]\n2. [Brown]\n3. [ ]\n4. [ ]\n5. [ ]\n6. [ ]\n7. [Gray]\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining positions:\n\n- The blue book must be to the right of the brown book, so it can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n- The purple book must be to the right of the blue book, so it can be in position 4, 5, or 6.\n- The green book must be to the right of the purple book, so it can be in position 5 or 6.\n- The yellow book must be to the right of the green book, so it can be in position 6.\n\nLet's try to fill in the positions:\n\n1. [Orange]\n2. [Brown]\n3. [Blue]\n4. [Purple]\n5. [Green]\n6. [Yellow]\n7. [Gray]\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which book is third from the right:\n\n- The third from the right is position 5, which is the Green book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
