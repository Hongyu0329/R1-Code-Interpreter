    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Peaches are the cheapest.\n2. Apples are the second-cheapest.\n3. Loquats are the third-cheapest.\n4. Plums are the fourth-most expensive.\n5. Kiwis are more expensive than mangoes.\n6. Oranges are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start arranging the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Peaches\n2. Apples\n3. Loquats\n4. ?\n5. Plums\n6. ?\n7. ?\n\nWe know that kiwis are more expensive than mangoes, and oranges are less expensive than mangoes. This means the order of kiwis, mangoes, and oranges must be:\n\n- Oranges < Mangoes < Kiwis\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining slots:\n\n- Since plums are the fourth-most expensive, they occupy the fourth position.\n- Oranges, mangoes, and kiwis must occupy the remaining positions (5th, 6th, and 7th).\n\nLet's try to fit them in:\n\n1. Peaches\n2. Apples\n3. Loquats\n4. Plums\n5. Oranges\n6. Mangoes\n7. Kiwis\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Now, let's verify the options:\n\n- (A) The oranges are the third-cheapest: False, they are the fifth.\n- (B) The loquats are the third-cheapest: True, they are the third.\n- (C) The apples are the third-cheapest: False, they are the second.\n- (D) The kiwis are the third-cheapest: False, they are the seventh.\n- (E) The mangoes are the third-cheapest: False, they are the sixth.\n- (F) The plums are the third-cheapest: False, they are the fourth.\n- (G) The peaches are the third-cheapest: False, they are the first.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
