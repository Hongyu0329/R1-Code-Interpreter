    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Ana finished last, so Ana is in 7th place.\n2. Mya finished above Rob, so Mya is not in 4th place.\n3. Dan finished above Mya, so Dan is not in 4th place.\n4. Rob finished fourth, so Rob is in 4th place.\n5. Eli finished second, so Eli is in 2nd place.\n6. Mel finished above Ada, so Mel is not in 6th place.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the golfers in order:\n\n- Ana is in 7th place.\n- Rob is in 4th place.\n- Eli is in 2nd place.\n\nNow, we need to determine the positions of Mel, Dan, Mya, and Ada. Since Dan finished above Mya, and Mel finished above Ada, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Dan must be in 1st or 3rd place.\n- Mya must be in 3rd or 5th place.\n- Mel must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th place.\n- Ada must be in 5th or 6th place.\n\nLet's try to place them:\n\n1. Dan cannot be in 3rd place because Mya would then have to be in 5th place, which would leave no room for Mel to be above Ada. Therefore, Dan is in 1st place.\n2. With Dan in 1st place, Mya can be in 3rd place.\n3. Mel must be in 5th place to be above Ada.\n4. Ada is in 6th place.\n\nThe final order is:\n\n1. Dan\n2. Eli\n3. Mya\n4. Rob\n5. Mel\n6. Ada\n7. Ana\n\nNow, let's determine who finished fourth:\n\n- Rob finished fourth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
