    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions and try to place each bird in the correct position:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n2. The owl is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the left of the hummingbird.\n4. The quail is to the right of the falcon.\n5. The robin is to the right of the owl.\n6. The blue jay is the third from the right.\n\nLet's start by placing the owl, as it has a fixed position:\n\n- _ Owl _ _ _ _ _\n\nNext, we place the blue jay, which is the third from the right:\n\n- _ Owl _ _ _ Blue Jay _\n\nNow, let's place the hummingbird, falcon, and quail based on their relative positions:\n\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n- The quail is to the right of the falcon.\n\nSince the blue jay is already placed, the falcon and quail must be to its left. Let's try placing them:\n\n- _ Owl _ _ Falcon Blue Jay Quail\n\nNow, place the hummingbird to the left of the falcon:\n\n- _ Owl _ Hummingbird Falcon Blue Jay Quail\n\nThe robin is to the left of the hummingbird and to the right of the owl:\n\n- _ Owl Robin Hummingbird Falcon Blue Jay Quail\n\nFinally, the only bird left is the hawk, which must be placed in the remaining position:\n\n- Hawk Owl Robin Hummingbird Falcon Blue Jay Quail\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon. (True)\n2. The owl is the second from the left. (True)\n3. The robin is to the left of the hummingbird. (True)\n4. The quail is to the right of the falcon. (True)\n5. The robin is to the right of the owl. (True)\n6. The blue jay is the third from the right. (True)\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Now, let's determine which bird is the second from the left:\n\n- The second from the left is the owl.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
