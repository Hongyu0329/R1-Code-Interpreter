  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe.\nOptions:\n(A) Ana finished second\n(B) Eve finished second\n(C) Ada finished second\n(D) Dan finished second\n(E) Rob finished second\n(F) Amy finished second\n(G) Joe finished second\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the golfers based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Dan finished third.\n2. Ana finished above Ada.\n3. Amy finished last.\n4. Dan finished below Rob.\n5. Eve finished below Ada.\n6. Rob finished below Joe.\n\nWe need to find out who finished second. Let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Since Amy finished last, she is in the 7th position.\n- Dan is in the 3rd position.\n- Rob is below Joe, so Rob cannot be 1st or 2nd.\n- Dan is below Rob, so Rob must be 1st or 2nd.\n- Ana is above Ada, so Ana cannot be below Ada.\n- Eve is below Ada, so Eve cannot be above Ada.\n\nLet's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n1. Joe (since Rob is below Joe and Dan is below Rob, Joe must be 1st)\n2. Rob (since Rob is below Joe and above Dan)\n3. Dan\n4. Ana (since Ana is above Ada and Eve)\n5. Ada (since Ada is above Eve)\n6. Eve\n7. Amy\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- Dan is 3rd, which matches.\n- Ana is above Ada, which matches.\n- Amy is last, which matches.\n- Dan is below Rob, which matches.\n- Eve is below Ada, which matches.\n- Rob is below Joe, which matches.\n\nThe order is consistent with all the conditions. Therefore, Rob is in the second position.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<B) Rob finished second>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
