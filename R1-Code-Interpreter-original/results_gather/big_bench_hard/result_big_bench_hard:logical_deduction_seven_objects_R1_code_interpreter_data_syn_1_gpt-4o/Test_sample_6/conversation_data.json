  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Amy, Eve, Ada, Rob, Dan, Mel, and Joe. Joe finished third. Dan finished last. Eve finished first. Mel finished below Rob. Ada finished above Joe. Rob finished third-to-last.\nOptions:\n(A) Amy finished last\n(B) Eve finished last\n(C) Ada finished last\n(D) Rob finished last\n(E) Dan finished last\n(F) Mel finished last\n(G) Joe finished last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Joe finished third.\n2. Dan finished last.\n3. Eve finished first.\n4. Mel finished below Rob.\n5. Ada finished above Joe.\n6. Rob finished third-to-last.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the golfers in order:\n\n- Eve is 1st.\n- Joe is 3rd.\n- Dan is 7th (last).\n- Rob is 5th (third-to-last).\n\nNow, we need to place Ada, Mel, and Amy in the remaining positions: 2nd, 4th, and 6th.\n\n- Ada must be above Joe, so Ada is 2nd.\n- Mel must be below Rob, so Mel is 6th.\n- This leaves Amy in 4th place.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Eve\n2. Ada\n3. Joe\n4. Amy\n5. Rob\n6. Mel\n7. Dan\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which one matches the golfer who finished last:\n\n(A) Amy finished last - Incorrect\n(B) Eve finished last - Incorrect\n(C) Ada finished last - Incorrect\n(D) Rob finished last - Incorrect\n(E) Dan finished last - Correct\n(F) Mel finished last - Incorrect\n(G) Joe finished last - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is (E) Dan finished last.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
