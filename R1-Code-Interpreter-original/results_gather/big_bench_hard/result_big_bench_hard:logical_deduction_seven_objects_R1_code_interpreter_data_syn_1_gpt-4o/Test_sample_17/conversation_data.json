    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to arrange the books accordingly:\n\n1. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n2. The green book is to the left of the white book.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n4. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n5. The green book is to the right of the orange book.\n6. The black book is the second from the left.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the books:\n\n- Since the black book is the second from the left, the first position cannot be the black book.\n- The white book is the fourth from the left, so it occupies the fourth position.\n- The black book is in the second position.\n- The green book must be to the right of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be in the third position.\n- The purple book must be to the left of the yellow book, and the brown book must be to the right of the yellow book.\n\nLet's try to arrange the books step by step:\n\n1. Position 1: Unknown\n2. Position 2: Black book\n3. Position 3: Unknown\n4. Position 4: White book\n5. Position 5: Unknown\n6. Position 6: Unknown\n7. Position 7: Unknown\n\nNow, let's use the constraints to fill in the unknowns:\n\n- The green book must be to the right of the orange book, so the orange book can be in position 1 or 3.\n- The purple book must be to the left of the yellow book, and the brown book must be to the right of the yellow book.\n\nLet's try placing the orange book in position 1:\n\n1. Orange book\n2. Black book\n3. Green book (since it must be to the right of the orange book)\n4. White book\n5. Purple book (since it must be to the left of the yellow book)\n6. Yellow book\n7. Brown book (since it must be to the right of the yellow book)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Now, let's check the options to see which book is the leftmost:\n\n- (A) The green book is the leftmost: No, the orange book is the leftmost.\n- (B) The brown book is the leftmost: No, the brown book is the rightmost.\n- (C) The white book is the leftmost: No, the white book is fourth.\n- (D) The black book is the leftmost: No, the black book is second.\n- (E) The orange book is the leftmost: Yes, the orange book is in position 1.\n- (F) The purple book is the leftmost: No, the purple book is fifth.\n- (G) The yellow book is the leftmost: No, the yellow book is sixth.\n\nThe correct answer is (E) The orange book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
