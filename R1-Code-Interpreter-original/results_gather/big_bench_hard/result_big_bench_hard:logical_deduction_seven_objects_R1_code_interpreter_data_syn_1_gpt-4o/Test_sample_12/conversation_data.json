  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ana, Mel, Ada, Eve, and Amy. Eve finished above Amy. Dan finished second. Ada finished below Ana. Ana finished third-to-last. Mel finished last. Amy finished third.\nOptions:\n(A) Joe finished last\n(B) Dan finished last\n(C) Ana finished last\n(D) Mel finished last\n(E) Ada finished last\n(F) Eve finished last\n(G) Amy finished last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Eve finished above Amy.\n2. Dan finished second.\n3. Ada finished below Ana.\n4. Ana finished third-to-last.\n5. Mel finished last.\n6. Amy finished third.\n\nFrom these statements, we can start placing the golfers in order:\n\n- Since Dan finished second, the second position is occupied by Dan.\n- Amy finished third, so the third position is occupied by Amy.\n- Ana finished third-to-last, which means she is in the fifth position.\n- Mel finished last, so the seventh position is occupied by Mel.\n- Eve finished above Amy, so Eve must be in the first position because the second and third positions are already occupied by Dan and Amy, respectively.\n- Ada finished below Ana, so Ada must be in the sixth position because the fifth position is occupied by Ana and the seventh position is occupied by Mel.\n\nNow, we have the following order:\n\n1. Eve\n2. Dan\n3. Amy\n4. Joe (the only remaining golfer)\n5. Ana\n6. Ada\n7. Mel\n\nThe question asks which golfer finished last. According to our arrangement, Mel finished last.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the logic is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the positions based on the given conditions\npositions = ['Eve', 'Dan', 'Amy', 'Joe', 'Ana', 'Ada', 'Mel']\n\n# Check who finished last\nlast_position = positions[-1]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(last_position)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the golfer who finished last.",
    "The code output confirms that Mel finished last, which aligns with the information provided and the logical deductions made. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n<<<D) Mel finished last>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
