  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a station wagon, a sedan, a bus, a motorcyle, a hatchback, a tractor, and a minivan. The sedan is the third-oldest. The tractor is newer than the motorcyle. The bus is older than the motorcyle. The bus is newer than the hatchback. The minivan is the newest. The station wagon is the oldest.\nOptions:\n(A) The station wagon is the oldest\n(B) The sedan is the oldest\n(C) The bus is the oldest\n(D) The motorcyle is the oldest\n(E) The hatchback is the oldest\n(F) The tractor is the oldest\n(G) The minivan is the oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The sedan is the third-oldest.\n2. The tractor is newer than the motorcycle.\n3. The bus is older than the motorcycle.\n4. The bus is newer than the hatchback.\n5. The minivan is the newest.\n6. The station wagon is the oldest.\n\nFrom these statements, we can start arranging the vehicles:\n\n- The station wagon is the oldest, so it is in the first position.\n- The sedan is the third-oldest, so it is in the third position.\n- The minivan is the newest, so it is in the seventh position.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining vehicles:\n\n- The bus is older than the motorcycle and newer than the hatchback. This means the hatchback must be older than the bus, and the motorcycle must be newer than the bus.\n- The tractor is newer than the motorcycle.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the remaining vehicles:\n\n1. Station Wagon (oldest)\n2. Hatchback (older than bus)\n3. Sedan (third-oldest)\n4. Bus (older than motorcycle, newer than hatchback)\n5. Motorcycle (newer than bus)\n6. Tractor (newer than motorcycle)\n7. Minivan (newest)\n\nNow, let's verify the order:\n\n- The station wagon is the oldest.\n- The sedan is the third-oldest.\n- The tractor is newer than the motorcycle.\n- The bus is older than the motorcycle and newer than the hatchback.\n- The minivan is the newest.\n\nThis order satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
