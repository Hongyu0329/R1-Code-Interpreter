    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Watermelons are less expensive than plums.\n2. Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.\n3. Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.\n4. Apples are more expensive than loquats.\n5. Plums are less expensive than mangoes.\n6. Mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start arranging the fruits:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, we have:\n  1. [Most Expensive]\n  2. [Second-Most Expensive]\n  3. Mangoes\n  4. [Fourth-Most Expensive]\n  5. [Fifth-Most Expensive]\n  6. [Sixth-Most Expensive]\n  7. [Cheapest]\n\n- From constraint 5, plums are less expensive than mangoes, so plums cannot be in positions 1 or 2.\n- From constraint 1, watermelons are less expensive than plums, so watermelons cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4.\n- From constraint 2, watermelons are more expensive than oranges, so oranges cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- From constraint 3, kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n- From constraint 4, apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nLet's use these constraints to determine the order of the fruits:\n\n```python\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = {\n    \"mangoes\": 3,\n    \"plums\": [4, 5, 6, 7],\n    \"watermelons\": [5, 6, 7],\n    \"oranges\": [6, 7],\n    \"kiwis\": [7],\n    \"apples\": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6],\n    \"loquats\": [7]\n}\n\n# Initialize the order list\norder = [None] * 7\n\n# Place mangoes in the third position\norder[2] = \"mangoes\"\n\n# Place loquats in the seventh position\norder[6] = \"loquats\"\n\n# Place kiwis in the sixth position\norder[5] = \"kiwis\"\n\n# Place oranges in the fifth position\norder[4] = \"oranges\"\n\n# Place watermelons in the fourth position\norder[3] = \"watermelons\"\n\n# Place plums in the second position\norder[1] = \"plums\"\n\n# Place apples in the first position\norder[0] = \"apples\"\n\n# Check which fruit is the second-cheapest\nsecond_cheapest = order[1]\n\nprint(second_cheapest)\n```\n\nThe code will determine which fruit is the second-cheapest based on the constraints and the order we have deduced. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "Based on the constraints and the order we deduced, the plums are the second-cheapest fruit. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
