    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Oranges are the second-cheapest.\n2. Apples are less expensive than pears.\n3. Mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n4. Mangoes are the third-cheapest.\n5. Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n6. Loquats are the third-most expensive.\n\nGiven these clues, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Since oranges are the second-cheapest, they must be in the second position.\n- Mangoes are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in the sixth position.\n- Loquats are the third-most expensive, so they are in the fifth position.\n- Apples are less expensive than pears, so apples must be before pears.\n\nNow, let's fill in the positions:\n\n1. Cheapest: ?\n2. Second-cheapest: Oranges\n3. Third-cheapest: Mangoes\n4. ?\n5. Third-most expensive: Loquats\n6. Second-most expensive: Watermelons\n7. Most expensive: ?\n\nWe know that apples are less expensive than pears, so apples must be in the fourth position, and pears must be in the seventh position. This leaves the first position for cantaloupes.\n\nLet's verify:\n\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Oranges\n3. Mangoes\n4. Apples\n5. Loquats\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Oranges are second-cheapest.\n- Mangoes are third-cheapest.\n- Apples are less expensive than pears.\n- Mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n- Watermelons are second-most expensive.\n- Loquats are third-most expensive.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The loquats are the second-most expensive - Incorrect\n(B) The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive - Incorrect\n(C) The watermelons are the second-most expensive - Correct\n(D) The apples are the second-most expensive - Incorrect\n(E) The oranges are the second-most expensive - Incorrect\n(F) The pears are the second-most expensive - Incorrect\n(G) The mangoes are the second-most expensive - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
