    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and identify which book is third from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the white book.\n2. The red book is to the left of the purple book.\n3. The red book is to the right of the orange book.\n4. The gray book is the second from the left.\n5. The purple book is to the left of the green book.\n6. The blue book is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the books:\n\n- The gray book is second from the left: _ Gray _ _ _ _ _\n- The blue book is fourth from the left: _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n\nNow, let's consider the other conditions:\n\n- The red book is to the right of the orange book, so Orange must be to the left of Red.\n- The purple book is to the left of the green book, so Purple must be to the left of Green.\n- The green book is to the left of the white book, so Green must be to the left of White.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining books:\n\n1. The gray book is second from the left.\n2. The blue book is fourth from the left.\n3. The orange book must be to the left of the red book.\n4. The purple book must be to the left of the green book.\n5. The green book must be to the left of the white book.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n- The gray book is second: _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n- The blue book is fourth: _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n- The orange book must be to the left of the red book: Orange _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n- The red book is to the left of the purple book: Orange _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n- The purple book is to the left of the green book: Orange _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n- The green book is to the left of the white book: Orange _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n\nNow, let's try to fill in the blanks:\n\n1. Orange is first.\n2. Gray is second.\n3. Purple is third.\n4. Blue is fourth.\n5. Green is fifth.\n6. White is sixth.\n7. Red is seventh.\n\nThe order is: Orange, Gray, Purple, Blue, Green, White, Red.\n\nNow, let's check which book is third from the left:\n\n- The third book from the left is Purple.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
