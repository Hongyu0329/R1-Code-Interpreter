    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds on the branch according to the given conditions and then determine which bird is second from the left.\n\nLet's list the conditions:\n1. The owl is the second from the right.\n2. The cardinal is the fourth from the left.\n3. The falcon is to the left of the blue jay.\n4. The quail is to the left of the falcon.\n5. The raven is the second from the left.\n6. The robin is to the left of the quail.\n\nWe have seven positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nLet's start placing the birds according to the conditions:\n\n- From condition 1, the owl is in position 6 (second from the right).\n- From condition 5, the raven is in position 2 (second from the left).\n- From condition 2, the cardinal is in position 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining birds: falcon, blue jay, quail, and robin.\n\n- From condition 3, the falcon is to the left of the blue jay.\n- From condition 4, the quail is to the left of the falcon.\n- From condition 6, the robin is to the left of the quail.\n\nLet's try to place these birds:\n\n- Since the raven is in position 2, the robin must be in position 1 (to the left of the quail).\n- The quail can be in position 3 (to the left of the falcon).\n- The falcon can be in position 5 (to the left of the blue jay).\n- The blue jay can be in position 7.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n1. Robin\n2. Raven\n3. Quail\n4. Cardinal\n5. Falcon\n6. Owl\n7. Blue Jay\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Now, we need to determine which bird is second from the left.\n\nThe bird in position 2 is the raven.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The raven is the second from the left.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
