  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Mya, Eli, Ana, Amy, Mel, Dan, and Joe. Amy finished below Joe. Dan finished above Mya. Eli finished third. Ana finished first. Amy finished second-to-last. Mya finished fourth.\nOptions:\n(A) Mya finished first\n(B) Eli finished first\n(C) Ana finished first\n(D) Amy finished first\n(E) Mel finished first\n(F) Dan finished first\n(G) Joe finished first\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Ana finished first.\n2. Eli finished third.\n3. Mya finished fourth.\n4. Amy finished second-to-last, which means she finished sixth.\n5. Dan finished above Mya, so Dan must be either first, second, or third. Since Ana is first and Eli is third, Dan must be second.\n6. Amy finished below Joe, so Joe must be fifth.\n7. Mel is the only golfer left, so Mel must be seventh.\n\nNow, let's list the golfers in order of their finish:\n\n1. Ana\n2. Dan\n3. Eli\n4. Mya\n5. Joe\n6. Amy\n7. Mel\n\nFrom the options given, we need to identify who finished first. According to the list, Ana finished first.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) Ana finished first>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
