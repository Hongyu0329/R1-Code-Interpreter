A fruit stand sells seven fruits: apples, plums, mangoes, watermelons, oranges, kiwis, and loquats. The watermelons are less expensive than the plums. The watermelons are more expensive than the oranges. The kiwis are less expensive than the oranges. The apples are more expensive than the loquats. The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Watermelons < Plums\n2. Watermelons > Oranges\n3. Kiwis < Oranges\n4. Apples > Loquats\n5. Plums < Mangoes\n6. Mangoes are the third-most expensive\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, they are in the third position.\n- Plums are less expensive than mangoes, so they must be in the first or second position.\n- Watermelons are less expensive than plums, so they must be in the first position.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than oranges, so oranges must be in the first position.\n- Kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis must be in the first position.\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats must be in the first position.\n\nLet's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Loquats\n2. Kiwis\n3. Oranges\n4. Watermelons\n5. Plums\n6. Mangoes\n7. Apples\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which fruit is the cheapest:\n\n- (A) The apples are the cheapest - No, apples are the most expensive.\n- (B) The plums are the cheapest - No, plums are in the fifth position.\n- (C) The mangoes are the cheapest - No, mangoes are in the third position.\n- (D) The watermelons are the cheapest - No, watermelons are in the fourth position.\n- (E) The oranges are the cheapest - No, oranges are in the third position.\n- (F) The kiwis are the cheapest - No, kiwis are in the second position.\n- (G) The loquats are the cheapest - Yes, loquats are in the first position.\n\nTherefore, the loquats are the cheapest.\n\n<<<G>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
