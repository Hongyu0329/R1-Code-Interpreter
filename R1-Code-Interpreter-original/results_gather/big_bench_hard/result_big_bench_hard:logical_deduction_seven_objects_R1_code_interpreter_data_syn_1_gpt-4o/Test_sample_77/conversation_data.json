    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and determine which book is the rightmost. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the rightmost.\n2. The yellow book is the leftmost.\n3. The orange book is the second from the right.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the green book.\n5. The brown book is to the right of the black book.\n6. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n- The purple book is the rightmost, so it occupies the seventh position.\n- The orange book is the second from the right, so it occupies the sixth position.\n- The white book is the fourth from the left, so it occupies the fourth position.\n\nNow, we have the following partial arrangement:\n\n1. Yellow\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. White\n5. ?\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nNext, we need to place the brown, black, and green books:\n\n- The brown book is to the left of the green book and to the right of the black book. This means the black book must be placed before the brown book, and the brown book must be placed before the green book.\n\nLet's try to fit these books into the remaining positions (2, 3, and 5):\n\n- Position 2: Black\n- Position 3: Brown\n- Position 5: Green\n\nThis satisfies all the conditions:\n\n1. Yellow\n2. Black\n3. Brown\n4. White\n5. Green\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The brown book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(B) The yellow book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(C) The black book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(D) The white book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(E) The green book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(F) The orange book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(G) The purple book is the rightmost - Correct\n\nThe correct answer is option (G).\n\n<<<G>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
