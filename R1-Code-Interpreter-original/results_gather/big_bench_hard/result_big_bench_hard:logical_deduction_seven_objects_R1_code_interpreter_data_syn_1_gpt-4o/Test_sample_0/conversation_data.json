  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe.\nOptions:\n(A) Ana finished third\n(B) Eve finished third\n(C) Ada finished third\n(D) Dan finished third\n(E) Rob finished third\n(F) Amy finished third\n(G) Joe finished third\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the golfers based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Dan finished third.\n2. Ana finished above Ada.\n3. Amy finished last.\n4. Dan finished below Rob.\n5. Eve finished below Ada.\n6. Rob finished below Joe.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the golfers in order:\n\n- Since Dan finished third, we have: _ _ Dan _ _ _ _\n\n- Amy finished last, so: _ _ Dan _ _ _ Amy\n\n- Dan finished below Rob, so Rob must be either 1st or 2nd: Rob _ Dan _ _ _ Amy\n\n- Rob finished below Joe, so Joe must be 1st: Joe Rob Dan _ _ _ Amy\n\n- Ana finished above Ada, and Eve finished below Ada. This means Ana must be 4th, Ada 5th, and Eve 6th: Joe Rob Dan Ana Ada Eve Amy\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- Dan is third: Correct.\n- Ana is above Ada: Correct.\n- Amy is last: Correct.\n- Dan is below Rob: Correct.\n- Eve is below Ada: Correct.\n- Rob is below Joe: Correct.\n\nThe order is consistent with all the conditions. Therefore, the answer is that Dan finished third.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
