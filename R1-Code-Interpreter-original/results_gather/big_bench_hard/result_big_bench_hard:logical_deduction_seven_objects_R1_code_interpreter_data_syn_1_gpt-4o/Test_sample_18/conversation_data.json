    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The station wagon is the fourth-newest.\n2. The minivan is the third-newest.\n3. The tractor is the second-oldest.\n4. The convertible is older than the station wagon.\n5. The truck is newer than the bus.\n6. The hatchback is older than the convertible.\n\nLet's denote the vehicles as follows for simplicity:\n- T: Truck\n- H: Hatchback\n- M: Minivan\n- B: Bus\n- Tr: Tractor\n- S: Station Wagon\n- C: Convertible\n\nGiven the conditions, we can start placing the vehicles in order:\n\n- The minivan (M) is the third-newest, so it is in position 5.\n- The station wagon (S) is the fourth-newest, so it is in position 4.\n- The tractor (Tr) is the second-oldest, so it is in position 2.\n- The convertible (C) is older than the station wagon (S), so it must be in position 3 or older.\n- The hatchback (H) is older than the convertible (C), so it must be in position 1 or 2.\n- The truck (T) is newer than the bus (B).\n\nLet's try to place the vehicles in order:\n\n1. Since the hatchback (H) is older than the convertible (C), and the tractor (Tr) is the second-oldest, the hatchback (H) must be the oldest.\n2. The tractor (Tr) is the second-oldest.\n3. The convertible (C) must be in position 3 because it is older than the station wagon (S) in position 4.\n4. The station wagon (S) is in position 4.\n5. The minivan (M) is in position 5.\n6. The truck (T) is newer than the bus (B), so the bus (B) must be in position 6, and the truck (T) in position 7.\n\nThe order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Hatchback (H)\n2. Tractor (Tr)\n3. Convertible (C)\n4. Station Wagon (S)\n5. Minivan (M)\n6. Bus (B)\n7. Truck (T)\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the third-oldest. From the order, the third-oldest vehicle is the Convertible (C).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The convertible is the third-oldest.\n\n<<<G>>>"
