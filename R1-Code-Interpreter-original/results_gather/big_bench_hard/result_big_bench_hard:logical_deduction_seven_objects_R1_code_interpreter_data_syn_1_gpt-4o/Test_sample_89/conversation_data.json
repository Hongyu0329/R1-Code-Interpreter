    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The truck is the oldest.\n2. The bus is the second-oldest.\n3. The minivan is the third-newest.\n4. The limousine is the fourth-newest.\n5. The tractor is older than the minivan.\n6. The station wagon is newer than the hatchback.\n\nLet's use these clues to arrange the vehicles:\n\n- Since the truck is the oldest, it is in position 1.\n- The bus is the second-oldest, so it is in position 2.\n- The minivan is the third-newest, which means it is in position 5.\n- The limousine is the fourth-newest, which means it is in position 4.\n- The tractor is older than the minivan, so it must be in position 3.\n- The station wagon is newer than the hatchback, so the station wagon must be in position 6, and the hatchback must be in position 7.\n\nNow, let's list the vehicles in order from oldest to newest:\n\n1. Truck\n2. Bus\n3. Tractor\n4. Limousine\n5. Minivan\n6. Station Wagon\n7. Hatchback\n\nFrom this order, we can see that the hatchback is the newest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (G) The hatchback is the newest.\n\n<<<G>>>"
