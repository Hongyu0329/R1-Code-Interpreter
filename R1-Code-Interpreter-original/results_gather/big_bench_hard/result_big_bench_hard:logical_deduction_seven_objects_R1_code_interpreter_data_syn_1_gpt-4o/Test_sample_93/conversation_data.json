    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and then identify which book is second from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n2. The green book is to the left of the white book.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n4. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n5. The green book is to the right of the orange book.\n6. The black book is the second from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the books:\n\n- The white book is the fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n- The black book is the second from the left, so it is in position 2.\n- The green book is to the right of the orange book, so orange must be to the left of green.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, and the brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n\nLet's use Python to find the correct order of the books.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nbooks = ['green', 'brown', 'white', 'black', 'orange', 'purple', 'yellow']\n\n# Conditions\ndef is_valid_order(order):\n    return (order.index('white') == 3 and\n            order.index('black') == 1 and\n            order.index('purple') < order.index('yellow') and\n            order.index('green') < order.index('white') and\n            order.index('brown') > order.index('yellow') and\n            order.index('green') > order.index('orange'))\n\n# Find the valid order\nfor order in permutations(books):\n    if is_valid_order(order):\n        print(order)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct order of the books.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the correct order of the books on the shelf: \n\n1. Orange\n2. Black\n3. Green\n4. White\n5. Purple\n6. Yellow\n7. Brown\n\nNow, we need to determine which book is second from the right. In this order, the second from the right is the yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
