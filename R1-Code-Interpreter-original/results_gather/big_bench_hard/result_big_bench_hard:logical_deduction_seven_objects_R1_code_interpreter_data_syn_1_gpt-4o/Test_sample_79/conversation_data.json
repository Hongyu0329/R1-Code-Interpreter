    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions and try to arrange the books accordingly:\n\n1. The red book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The white book is the second from the right.\n3. The red book is to the left of the green book.\n4. The blue book is to the right of the black book.\n5. The black book is the third from the right.\n6. The orange book is the leftmost.\n\nLet's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- Since the orange book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The black book is the third from the right, which means it is in the 5th position.\n- The white book is the second from the right, which means it is in the 6th position.\n- The blue book is to the right of the black book, so it must be in the 7th position.\n- The red book is to the right of the yellow book and to the left of the green book. Since the black, white, and blue books occupy the 5th, 6th, and 7th positions, the red and green books must be in the 3rd and 4th positions, respectively, with the yellow book in the 2nd position.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n1. Orange book (1st position)\n2. Yellow book (2nd position)\n3. Red book (3rd position)\n4. Green book (4th position)\n5. Black book (5th position)\n6. White book (6th position)\n7. Blue book (7th position)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the leftmost book is the orange book.\n\nThe correct option is (B) The orange book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"
