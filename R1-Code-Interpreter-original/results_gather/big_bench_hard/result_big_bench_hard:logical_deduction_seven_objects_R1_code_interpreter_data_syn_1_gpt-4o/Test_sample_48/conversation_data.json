  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ana, Mel, Ada, Eve, and Amy. Eve finished above Amy. Dan finished second. Ada finished below Ana. Ana finished third-to-last. Mel finished last. Amy finished third.\nOptions:\n(A) Joe finished first\n(B) Dan finished first\n(C) Ana finished first\n(D) Mel finished first\n(E) Ada finished first\n(F) Eve finished first\n(G) Amy finished first\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Eve finished above Amy.\n2. Dan finished second.\n3. Ada finished below Ana.\n4. Ana finished third-to-last.\n5. Mel finished last.\n6. Amy finished third.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- Since Mel finished last, Mel is in the 7th position.\n- Amy finished third, so Amy is in the 3rd position.\n- Dan finished second, so Dan is in the 2nd position.\n- Ana finished third-to-last, which means Ana is in the 5th position.\n- Ada finished below Ana, so Ada must be in the 6th position.\n- Eve finished above Amy, and since Amy is in the 3rd position, Eve must be in the 1st position.\n- This leaves Joe, who must be in the 4th position.\n\nNow, let's verify the order:\n1. Eve\n2. Dan\n3. Amy\n4. Joe\n5. Ana\n6. Ada\n7. Mel\n\nThis order satisfies all the given conditions. Now, we need to determine who finished first. According to the order, Eve finished first.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (F) Eve finished first.\n\n<<<F>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
