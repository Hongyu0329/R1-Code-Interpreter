    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given constraints and identify which book is fourth from the left.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the white book.\n2. The red book is to the left of the purple book.\n3. The red book is to the right of the orange book.\n4. The gray book is the second from the left.\n5. The purple book is to the left of the green book.\n6. The blue book is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the books:\n\n- The gray book is second from the left: _ Gray _ _ _ _ _\n- The blue book is fourth from the left: _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n\nNow, let's consider the other constraints:\n\n- The red book is to the right of the orange book, so Orange must be to the left of Red.\n- The purple book is to the left of the green book, and the green book is to the left of the white book.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining books:\n\n1. Place Orange to the left of Red.\n2. Place Purple to the left of Green, and Green to the left of White.\n\nNow, let's fill in the positions:\n\n- The gray book is second from the left.\n- The blue book is fourth from the left.\n- The orange book must be to the left of the red book.\n- The purple book must be to the left of the green book, and the green book must be to the left of the white book.\n\nLet's try to fit these into the positions:\n\n1. Orange must be first because Gray is second.\n2. Red must be after Orange.\n3. Purple must be before Green, and Green must be before White.\n\nLet's try this arrangement:\n\n1. Orange\n2. Gray\n3. Red\n4. Blue\n5. Purple\n6. Green\n7. White\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- The green book is to the left of the white book.\n- The red book is to the left of the purple book.\n- The red book is to the right of the orange book.\n- The gray book is the second from the left.\n- The purple book is to the left of the green book.\n- The blue book is the fourth from the left.\n\nNow, let's check which book is fourth from the left:\n\n- The fourth book is Blue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
