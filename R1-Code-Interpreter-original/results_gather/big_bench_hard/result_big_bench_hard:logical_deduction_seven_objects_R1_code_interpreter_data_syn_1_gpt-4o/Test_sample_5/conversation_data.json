  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eli, Eve, Mel, Joe, Mya, Rob, and Ada. Ada finished above Mya. Eli finished below Joe. Eli finished above Eve. Ada finished second-to-last. Mel finished third. Rob finished fourth.\nOptions:\n(A) Eli finished third-to-last\n(B) Eve finished third-to-last\n(C) Mel finished third-to-last\n(D) Joe finished third-to-last\n(E) Mya finished third-to-last\n(F) Rob finished third-to-last\n(G) Ada finished third-to-last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the golfers based on the given conditions and then identify who finished third-to-last.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. Ada finished above Mya.\n2. Eli finished below Joe.\n3. Eli finished above Eve.\n4. Ada finished second-to-last.\n5. Mel finished third.\n6. Rob finished fourth.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- Since Ada finished second-to-last, she is in the 6th position.\n- Mel is in the 3rd position.\n- Rob is in the 4th position.\n- Ada is above Mya, so Mya must be in the 7th position.\n- Eli is below Joe, and Eli is above Eve. This means Joe must be above Eli, and Eli must be above Eve.\n- The only positions left are 1st, 2nd, and 5th.\n\nLet's try to place Joe, Eli, and Eve:\n\n- Joe must be in 1st or 2nd because Eli is below him.\n- Eli must be in 5th because he is above Eve and below Joe.\n- Eve must be in 1st or 2nd, but since Eli is above Eve, Eve must be in 1st or 2nd, and Joe must be in 1st or 2nd.\n\nNow, let's finalize the order:\n\n1. Joe\n2. Eve\n3. Mel\n4. Rob\n5. Eli\n6. Ada\n7. Mya\n\nNow, we can see that Eli is in the 5th position, which is third-to-last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
