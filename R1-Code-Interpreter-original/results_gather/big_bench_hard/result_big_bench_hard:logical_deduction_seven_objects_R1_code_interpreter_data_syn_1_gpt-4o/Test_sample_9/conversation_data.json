    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and determine which book is the leftmost. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the rightmost.\n2. The yellow book is the leftmost.\n3. The orange book is the second from the right.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the green book.\n5. The brown book is to the right of the black book.\n6. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the purple book is the rightmost, it must be in position 7.\n- The orange book is second from the right, so it must be in position 6.\n- The yellow book is the leftmost, so it must be in position 1.\n- The white book is fourth from the left, so it must be in position 4.\n\nNow, we have the following partial arrangement:\n\n1. Yellow\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. White\n5. ?\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nNext, we need to place the brown, black, and green books:\n\n- The brown book is to the left of the green book, so it must be placed before the green book.\n- The brown book is to the right of the black book, so it must be placed after the black book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible arrangement for the remaining books is:\n\n1. Yellow\n2. Black\n3. Brown\n4. White\n5. Green\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The purple book is the rightmost (position 7) - Correct.\n- The yellow book is the leftmost (position 1) - Correct.\n- The orange book is the second from the right (position 6) - Correct.\n- The brown book is to the left of the green book (positions 3 and 5) - Correct.\n- The brown book is to the right of the black book (positions 3 and 2) - Correct.\n- The white book is the fourth from the left (position 4) - Correct.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, and the yellow book is indeed the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
