    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"he,\" which is a subject pronoun typically used to refer to a male individual.\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male individuals: \"the lawyer\" and \"the cashier.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure and Context**:\n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"because he needed to understand the case.\"\n\n4. **Determine Logical Antecedent**:\n   - The subordinate clause \"because he needed to understand the case\" provides a reason for the action in the main clause.\n   - The action in the main clause is performed by \"the lawyer\" (i.e., the lawyer looked into the accusations).\n   - It is logical to assume that the reason for the lawyer's action (looking into the accusations) is because the lawyer himself needed to understand the case.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - While it is possible for \"he\" to refer to \"the cashier,\" the context of the sentence suggests that the lawyer is the one actively seeking to understand the case, as he is the one looking into the accusations.\n   - There is no indication in the sentence that the cashier is involved in the action of understanding the case.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the context and logical flow of the sentence, \"he\" most likely refers to \"the lawyer.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is \"the lawyer.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The lawyer needed to understand"
