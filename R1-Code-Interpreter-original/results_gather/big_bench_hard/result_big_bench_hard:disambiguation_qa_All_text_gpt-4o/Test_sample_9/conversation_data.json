    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"The customer and the chef discuss his culinary training,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Nouns**: The nouns in the sentence are \"the customer\" and \"the chef.\"\n\n3. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The pronoun \"his\" is a possessive pronoun that could refer to either \"the customer\" or \"the chef.\"\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: \n   - The sentence involves a discussion about \"culinary training.\"\n   - Typically, \"culinary training\" is more closely associated with a chef than a customer, as chefs undergo culinary training as part of their profession.\n\n5. **Logical Inference**: \n   - Given the context, it is more logical to associate \"culinary training\" with \"the chef\" rather than \"the customer.\"\n   - Therefore, the pronoun \"his\" is more likely to refer to \"the chef.\"\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - While the sentence structure allows for the possibility of ambiguity, the context strongly suggests that \"his\" refers to \"the chef.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"his\" refers to \"the chef.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) It is the chef's culinary training"
