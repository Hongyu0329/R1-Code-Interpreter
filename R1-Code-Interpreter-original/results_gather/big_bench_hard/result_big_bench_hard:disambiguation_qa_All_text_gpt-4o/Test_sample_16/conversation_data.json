    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\" It is used as the subject of the verb \"focuses.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male individuals: \"the developer\" and \"the writer.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because he focuses on code.\" The clause \"because he focuses on code\" provides a reason for the developer's inability to communicate with the writer.\n\n4. **Determine Logical Consistency**: \n   - If \"he\" refers to \"the developer,\" the sentence implies that the developer's focus on code is the reason for the communication issue. This interpretation is logically consistent because it suggests that the developer is too focused on code to effectively communicate with the writer.\n   - If \"he\" refers to \"the writer,\" the sentence implies that the writer's focus on code is the reason for the communication issue. This interpretation is also logically consistent because it suggests that the writer is too focused on code to effectively communicate with the developer.\n\n5. **Assess Ambiguity**: Since both interpretations are logically consistent and the sentence does not provide additional context to favor one interpretation over the other, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
