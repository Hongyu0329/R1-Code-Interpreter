    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"they,\" which is used in the clause \"because they felt gravely ill.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two entities: \"The practitioner\" and \"the patient.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"they.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: \n   - The main clause is \"The practitioner made a house call for the patient.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"because they felt gravely ill.\"\n\n4. **Determine Logical Consistency**:\n   - The purpose of a house call is typically for the benefit of the patient. It is more logical that the patient is the one feeling gravely ill, prompting the practitioner to make the house call.\n   - If the practitioner were feeling gravely ill, it would be less likely for them to make a house call, as they would likely need care themselves.\n\n5. **Consider Common Usage and Context**:\n   - In medical contexts, when a practitioner makes a house call, it is usually because the patient requires immediate attention due to their health condition.\n   - The pronoun \"they\" is often used to refer to the most recently mentioned noun, but context and logic can override this rule.\n\n6. **Evaluate Ambiguity**:\n   - While grammatically, \"they\" could refer to either \"the practitioner\" or \"the patient,\" the context strongly suggests that \"the patient\" is the intended antecedent.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical and contextually appropriate antecedent for \"they\" is \"the patient.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The patient felt ill"
