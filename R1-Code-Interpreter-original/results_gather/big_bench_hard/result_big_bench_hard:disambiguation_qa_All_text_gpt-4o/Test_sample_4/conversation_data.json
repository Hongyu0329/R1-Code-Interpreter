    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"Bailey planned to meet the director at their office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"their.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"their\" in this sentence are \"Bailey\" and \"the director.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Context**:\n   - \"Bailey planned to meet the director at their office\" suggests that the office belongs to one of the two parties involved: Bailey or the director.\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or information that clearly indicates whose office it is.\n\n4. **Consider Common Usage**:\n   - In English, when referring to a meeting at an office, it is often implied that the office belongs to the person being visited, in this case, the director. However, this is not a strict rule and can vary based on context.\n\n5. **Evaluate Options**:\n   - (A) The office was the director's office: This is a common interpretation based on typical meeting scenarios, but it is not definitively stated in the sentence.\n   - (B) The office was Bailey's office: This is also a possibility, but again, it is not definitively stated.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: Given the lack of explicit information in the sentence, it is not possible to definitively determine whose office it is.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without additional context or information, the sentence does not clearly specify whether the office belongs to Bailey or the director. Therefore, the antecedent of \"their\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
