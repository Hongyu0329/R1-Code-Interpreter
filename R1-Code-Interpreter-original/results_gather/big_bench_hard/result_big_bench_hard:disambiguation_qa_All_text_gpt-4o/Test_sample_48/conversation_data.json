    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Analysis**: \n   - The sentence is: \"This story could not be published without the writer and his friends' support.\"\n   - The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n\n2. **Identifying the Antecedent**:\n   - The sentence mentions \"the writer and his friends' support.\"\n   - The structure \"the writer and his friends\" suggests that \"his\" is referring to the writer.\n   - The phrase \"his friends\" implies that the friends belong to the writer.\n\n3. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **Option (A)**: \"They were the writer's friends\" - This option suggests that \"his\" refers to the writer, which aligns with our analysis.\n   - **Option (B)**: \"They were the friends' friends\" - This option suggests that \"his\" refers to the friends, which does not fit the sentence structure.\n   - **Option (C)**: \"They were the story's friends\" - This option suggests that \"his\" refers to the story, which is not logical as stories do not have friends.\n   - **Option (D)**: \"Ambiguous\" - This option suggests that the antecedent is unclear, but based on the sentence structure, \"his\" clearly refers to the writer.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most logical and grammatically correct antecedent for \"his\" in the sentence is the writer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) They were the writer's friends"
