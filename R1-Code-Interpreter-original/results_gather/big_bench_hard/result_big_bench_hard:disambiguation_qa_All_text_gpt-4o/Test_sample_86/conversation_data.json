    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The assistant asked the physician if he needs any help,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Nouns**: The nouns in the sentence are \"assistant\" and \"physician.\"\n\n3. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\"\n\n4. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence structure is: \"The assistant asked the physician if he needs any help.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The assistant asked the physician.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"if he needs any help.\"\n\n5. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned noun, which in this case is \"the physician.\"\n   - However, without additional context, it is not definitively clear whether \"he\" refers to \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\"\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide enough context to definitively determine whether \"he\" refers to \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\"\n   - Both interpretations are plausible: the assistant could be asking if the physician needs help, or the assistant could be asking if he himself needs help.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Due to the lack of clear context or additional information, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
