    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"they,\" which is used as the subject of the verb \"were repairing.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The worker told the pedestrian that they were repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible.\"\n\n3. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two potential antecedents for \"they\":\n   - \"The worker\"\n   - \"The pedestrian\"\n\n4. **Analyze Contextual Clues**:\n   - The sentence describes a situation where someone is repairing the sidewalk. Typically, workers are responsible for repairs, not pedestrians. This suggests that \"the worker\" is more likely to be the one doing the repairing.\n   - The use of \"they\" as a pronoun can be singular or plural, but in this context, it is more likely to refer to a group or an individual in a non-gender-specific way. Since \"the worker\" is singular, \"they\" could be used to refer to the worker in a gender-neutral way.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**: Despite the contextual clues, the sentence does not explicitly state who is doing the repairing. The pronoun \"they\" could technically refer to either \"the worker\" or \"the pedestrian,\" making it ambiguous without additional context.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, while it is more logical for \"the worker\" to be the one repairing the sidewalk, the sentence does not provide enough explicit information to definitively assign the pronoun \"they\" to either \"the worker\" or \"the pedestrian.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> C"
