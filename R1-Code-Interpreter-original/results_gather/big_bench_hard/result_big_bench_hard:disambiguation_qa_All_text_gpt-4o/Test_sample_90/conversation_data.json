    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"The reporter and the chef will discuss her favorite dishes,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"her.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"her\" in the sentence are \"the reporter\" and \"the chef.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence structure is \"The reporter and the chef will discuss her favorite dishes.\"\n   - The pronoun \"her\" is singular and feminine, which matches both \"the reporter\" and \"the chef\" if we assume they are both female.\n\n4. **Determine Clarity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide any additional context or clues to specify whether \"her\" refers to \"the reporter\" or \"the chef.\"\n   - Without additional context, both interpretations are equally plausible.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether \"her\" refers to \"the reporter\" or \"the chef,\" the antecedent of \"her\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
