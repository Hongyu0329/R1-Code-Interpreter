    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"his,\" which is a possessive pronoun. It is used to indicate ownership or association with a male individual.\n\n2. **Identify the Nouns in the Sentence**: The sentence contains two male-associated nouns: \"the mechanic\" and \"the customer.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Context**: The sentence describes a situation where a mechanic is calling a customer to inform them about the status of a car. The context suggests a professional interaction where the mechanic is providing a service to the customer.\n\n4. **Analyze the Likely Ownership**:\n   - The mechanic is likely the service provider, and it is common in such contexts for the service provider to inform the customer about the status of the customer's property, in this case, the car.\n   - The customer is the recipient of the service, and it is logical to assume that the car being serviced belongs to the customer.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Options**:\n   - (A) It was the mechanic's car: This is unlikely because the mechanic is informing the customer, which suggests the car belongs to the customer.\n   - (B) It was the customer's car: This is the most logical conclusion given the context of the sentence.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: The sentence does not provide explicit information that makes the ownership of the car ambiguous. The context strongly suggests it is the customer's car.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the pronoun \"his\" most likely refers to the customer, indicating that the car belongs to the customer.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) It was the customer's car"
