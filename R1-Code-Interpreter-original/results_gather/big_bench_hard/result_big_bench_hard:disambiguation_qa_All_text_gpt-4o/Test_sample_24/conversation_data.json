    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\" It is used to refer to a male individual who is an expert on rare skin conditions.\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male individuals:\n   - \"The patient\"\n   - \"The specialist\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The patient was referred to the specialist because he is an expert on rare skin conditions.\"\n\n4. **Determine Logical Antecedent**:\n   - The phrase \"The patient was referred to the specialist\" suggests a reason for the referral.\n   - The reason provided is \"because he is an expert on rare skin conditions.\"\n   - Logically, the reason for referring a patient to a specialist would be because the specialist has expertise in the relevant area, not the patient.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the logical flow and typical context of such sentences, \"he\" most likely refers to \"the specialist,\" as it makes sense that the patient is referred to someone with expertise.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of \"he\" is \"the specialist.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The specialist is an expert"
