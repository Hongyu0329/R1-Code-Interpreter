    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two potential antecedents for \"they\":\n   - \"The taxpayer\"\n   - \"The accountant\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**: \n   - The sentence describes a meeting between the taxpayer and the accountant with the purpose of finding out if \"they\" could help with tax preparation.\n   - Typically, in a context involving tax preparation, an accountant is the professional who provides help or assistance. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that the taxpayer is seeking help from the accountant.\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - Given the context, it is more likely that \"they\" refers to \"the accountant,\" as the accountant is the one who would typically provide help with tax preparation.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - While the context suggests that \"they\" refers to \"the accountant,\" the sentence structure does not explicitly clarify this, leaving room for potential ambiguity. However, based on common understanding and context, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"they\" refers to \"the accountant.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the accountant.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The accountant could help"
