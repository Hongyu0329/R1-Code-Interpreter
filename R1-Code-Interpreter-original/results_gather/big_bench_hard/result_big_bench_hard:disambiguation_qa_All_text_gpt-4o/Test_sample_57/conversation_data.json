    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"her.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the mechanic\" and \"the customer.\" The pronoun \"her\" is a possessive pronoun, indicating ownership or association with a female.\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is: \"The mechanic called to inform the customer that her car would be ready in the morning.\"\n   - The structure suggests that the mechanic is providing information to the customer about a car.\n\n4. **Determine Logical Ownership**:\n   - The mechanic is the one providing the service, so it is less likely that the car belongs to the mechanic.\n   - The customer is the one being informed about the car's readiness, which implies that the car is associated with the customer.\n\n5. **Contextual Understanding**:\n   - In typical scenarios, a mechanic would inform a customer about the status of the customer's car, not the mechanic's car.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the sentence structure and typical context, \"her\" most logically refers to the customer, indicating that it is the customer's car.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" is the customer's car.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) It was the customer's car"
