    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male nouns: \"the scientist\" and \"the artist.\" Both are potential antecedents for \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The scientist will collaborate with the artist, and he will share a story.\" The pronoun \"he\" follows the conjunction \"and,\" which connects two independent clauses. The first clause is \"The scientist will collaborate with the artist,\" and the second clause is \"he will share a story.\"\n\n4. **Consider Contextual Clues**: The sentence does not provide additional context or clues that would clearly indicate whether \"he\" refers to \"the scientist\" or \"the artist.\" Both individuals are equally likely to be the subject of the second clause.\n\n5. **Determine Ambiguity**: Since there is no clear indication or context to specify whether \"he\" refers to \"the scientist\" or \"the artist,\" the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
