    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The assistant asked the physician if they could borrow some money,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the assistant\" and \"the physician.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure:**\n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The assistant asked the physician if they could borrow some money.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The assistant asked the physician.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"if they could borrow some money.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Contextual Clarity:**\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or information that clearly indicates who \"they\" refers to.\n   - Both \"the assistant\" and \"the physician\" are singular nouns, but \"they\" is often used as a singular pronoun in modern English to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or to maintain gender neutrality.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - Option (A): \"Asked if the assistant could borrow money\" suggests that \"they\" refers to \"the assistant.\"\n   - Option (B): \"Asked if the physician could borrow money\" suggests that \"they\" refers to \"the physician.\"\n   - Option (C): \"Ambiguous\" suggests that it is unclear who \"they\" refers to.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional context or clarification, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \"they\" refers to \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\"\n   - Therefore, the pronoun \"they\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> C"
