    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved:\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its position**: The pronoun in question is \"him,\" which appears in the phrase \"told him a fake story.\"\n\n2. **Identify the subjects and objects in the sentence**:\n   - The main subject of the sentence is \"The writer.\"\n   - The object of the writer's action is \"the salesperson.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the actions described**:\n   - The writer is performing two actions: \"tried to fool\" and \"told a fake story.\"\n   - The action \"tried to fool\" is directed towards \"the salesperson,\" as indicated by the structure \"tried to fool the salesperson.\"\n\n4. **Determine the likely antecedent of \"him\"**:\n   - Since the writer is trying to fool the salesperson, it is logical to conclude that the writer is telling the fake story to the salesperson as part of the attempt to fool him.\n   - Therefore, \"him\" most likely refers to \"the salesperson.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - Option (A) suggests that the writer told the writer a fake story, which does not make sense in the context of the sentence.\n   - Option (B) suggests that the writer told the salesperson a fake story, which aligns with the logical flow of the sentence.\n   - Option (C) suggests ambiguity, but the context provides enough information to reasonably conclude that \"him\" refers to the salesperson.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical and contextually supported antecedent for \"him\" is \"the salesperson.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Told the salesperson a fake story"
