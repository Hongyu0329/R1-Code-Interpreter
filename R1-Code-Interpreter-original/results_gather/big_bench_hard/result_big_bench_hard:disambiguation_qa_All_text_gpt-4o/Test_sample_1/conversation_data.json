    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The scientist collaborated with the artist, and he shared a story,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"he\" are \"the scientist\" and \"the artist.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is composed of two independent clauses: \"The scientist collaborated with the artist\" and \"he shared a story.\"\n   - The pronoun \"he\" appears in the second clause, which follows the conjunction \"and.\"\n\n4. **Consider Contextual Clues**: \n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or information that clearly indicates which individual, the scientist or the artist, shared a story.\n   - Both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" are equally plausible antecedents for \"he\" based on the sentence alone.\n\n5. **Determine Ambiguity**: \n   - Since there is no clear indication or additional context to specify whether \"he\" refers to \"the scientist\" or \"the artist,\" the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the scientist\" or \"the artist,\" and without further context, it is not possible to definitively determine the antecedent.\n\n<<<answer>>>C"
