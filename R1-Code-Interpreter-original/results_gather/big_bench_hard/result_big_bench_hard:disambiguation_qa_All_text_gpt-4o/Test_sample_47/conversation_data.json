    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\" It is used as the subject of the verb \"smelled.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male entities: \"the nurse\" and \"the laborer.\" Both are potential antecedents for \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**: The sentence states, \"The nurse was running from the laborer because he smelled awful.\" The structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: the nurse's action (running away) is a response to something related to the laborer.\n\n4. **Logical Interpretation**: It is more logical to infer that the nurse is running away because the laborer smelled awful, rather than the nurse running away because he himself smelled awful. The action of running away is typically a response to an unpleasant external factor, which in this case would be the laborer's smell.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**: While the sentence could technically be interpreted as ambiguous due to the presence of two male entities, the logical interpretation strongly favors the laborer as the antecedent. The context implies that the laborer's smell is the reason for the nurse's action.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"he\" refers to \"the laborer.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The laborer smelled awful"
