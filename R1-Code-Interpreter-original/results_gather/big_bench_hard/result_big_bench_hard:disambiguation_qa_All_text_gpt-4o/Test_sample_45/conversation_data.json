    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"Alex tells us that they could not meet,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"Alex tells us that they could not meet.\" Here, \"Alex\" is the subject who is doing the telling, \"us\" is the object receiving the information, and \"they\" is the subject of the clause \"they could not meet.\"\n\n3. **Consider Possible Antecedents**:\n   - **Option (A)**: \"Alex could not meet\" suggests that \"they\" refers to \"Alex.\" However, \"Alex\" is singular, and \"they\" is typically used as a plural pronoun or a singular gender-neutral pronoun. Without additional context indicating that \"Alex\" uses \"they\" as a singular pronoun, this option is less likely.\n   - **Option (B)**: \"We could not meet\" suggests that \"they\" refers to \"us.\" However, \"us\" is the object of the main clause, and there is no direct indication that \"they\" refers to \"us.\"\n   - **Option (C)**: \"Ambiguous\" suggests that there is not enough information to definitively determine the antecedent of \"they.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate Context**: Without additional context, it is unclear whether \"they\" refers to \"Alex,\" \"us,\" or another group entirely. The sentence does not provide enough information to definitively assign \"they\" to a specific antecedent.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of clear context or grammatical cues, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
