    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The mechanic disliked the cashier because he is arrogant,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\" It is used as the subject of the clause \"he is arrogant.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two parts:\n   - \"The mechanic disliked the cashier\" is the main clause.\n   - \"because he is arrogant\" is a subordinate clause explaining the reason for the mechanic's dislike.\n\n3. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the mechanic\" or \"the cashier,\" as both are male nouns mentioned in the sentence.\n\n4. **Analyze the Context**: The context provided by the sentence is that the mechanic dislikes the cashier. The reason given is \"because he is arrogant.\" Typically, when a reason is given for disliking someone, it is more logical for the pronoun to refer to the person being disliked, as their characteristic (arrogance) is the cause of the dislike.\n\n5. **Consider Common Usage and Logic**: In English, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause that follows a main clause, it often refers to the subject of the main clause unless context suggests otherwise. However, in this case, the context suggests that the arrogance is a trait of the person being disliked, which is the cashier.\n\n6. **Evaluate Ambiguity**: While it is technically possible for \"he\" to refer to either the mechanic or the cashier, the logical interpretation based on the context of the sentence is that \"he\" refers to the cashier. The sentence implies that the mechanic's dislike is due to the cashier's arrogance.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"he\" is \"the cashier.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The cashier is arrogant"
