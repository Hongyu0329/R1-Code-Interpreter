    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The developer argued with the designer because he liked the design,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\" It is used as the subject of the verb \"liked.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"he\" are \"the developer\" and \"the designer.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as \"The developer argued with the designer because he liked the design.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The developer argued with the designer.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"because he liked the design.\"\n\n4. **Consider Context and Common Usage**:\n   - In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned noun of the same gender, which in this case would be \"the designer.\"\n   - However, the sentence does not provide additional context to definitively determine whether \"he\" refers to \"the developer\" or \"the designer.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate Ambiguity**:\n   - Without additional context, both \"the developer\" and \"the designer\" are equally plausible antecedents for \"he.\"\n   - The sentence does not provide enough information to clearly determine which individual liked the design.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of clear context or grammatical cues to favor one antecedent over the other, the pronoun \"he\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
