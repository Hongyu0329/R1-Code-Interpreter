    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"their.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two entities: \"the supervisor\" and \"the employee.\" These are the possible antecedents for the pronoun \"their.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**: The sentence states, \"The supervisor gave the employee feedback on their stellar performance.\" The context suggests that feedback is being given about a performance. Typically, feedback is given to someone about their own performance rather than someone else's. \n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**: \n   - \"The supervisor\" is the one giving feedback, which implies they are not the subject of the feedback.\n   - \"The employee\" is the recipient of the feedback, which makes it logical that the feedback is about the employee's performance.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the context and typical usage, \"their\" most likely refers to \"the employee,\" as it is common for feedback to be given to someone regarding their own performance.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of \"their\" is \"the employee.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) It was the employee's performance"
