    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\" We need to determine who \"she\" refers to in the sentence.\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is: \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she used big words.\"\n\n3. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the developer\" and \"the writer.\" \"She\" could potentially refer to either of these individuals.\n\n4. **Analyze the Context**: The sentence states that the developer was unable to communicate with the writer because \"she used big words.\" The use of \"because\" suggests a causal relationship. The inability to communicate is attributed to the use of big words.\n\n5. **Determine Logical Antecedent**: \n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the developer,\" it would mean the developer uses big words, which is why the developer cannot communicate with the writer. This interpretation is less logical because it would imply the developer is causing their own communication issue.\n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the writer,\" it would mean the writer uses big words, which is why the developer cannot communicate with her. This interpretation is more logical because it suggests the writer's use of big words is the barrier to communication.\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**: While the sentence structure and context suggest that \"she\" most likely refers to \"the writer,\" the sentence does not explicitly clarify this. Therefore, there is a potential for ambiguity.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"she\" is \"the writer,\" but the sentence could be considered ambiguous without additional context.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<answer>>> (B) The writer uses big words <<<answer>>>"
