    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the roles of the individuals involved:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Context**: The pronoun in question is \"she,\" which appears in the clause \"otherwise she would have to mop it all over again.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Characters**: The sentence involves two characters: the janitor and the child.\n\n3. **Analyze the Action**: The action described is mopping the floor again. Typically, mopping is a task associated with a janitor's duties, not a child's.\n\n4. **Consider the Logical Flow**: The janitor warns the child not to step on the wet floor. If the child steps on it, the floor will likely become dirty or marked, necessitating another round of mopping. It is logical to assume that the janitor, whose responsibility is to maintain the cleanliness of the floor, would be the one to mop it again.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Options**:\n   - **Option (A)**: \"The janitor would have to mop\" aligns with the logical flow and the typical responsibilities of a janitor.\n   - **Option (B)**: \"The child would have to mop\" is less likely, as it is uncommon for a child to be responsible for mopping a floor, especially in a context where a janitor is present.\n   - **Option (C)**: \"Ambiguous\" would apply if there were no clear indication of who \"she\" refers to, but given the context and typical roles, it is not ambiguous.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the context and typical roles, the pronoun \"she\" most likely refers to the janitor.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
