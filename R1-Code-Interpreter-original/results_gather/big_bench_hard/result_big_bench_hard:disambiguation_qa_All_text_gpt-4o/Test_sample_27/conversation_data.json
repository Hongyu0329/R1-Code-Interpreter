    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"they\" in the sentence are \"the secretary\" and \"the developer.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The secretary corrected the developer because they better understood the problem.\" The pronoun \"they\" is used to explain the reason why the secretary corrected the developer.\n\n4. **Determine the Logical Antecedent**: \n   - If \"they\" refers to \"the secretary,\" it implies that the secretary corrected the developer because the secretary had a better understanding of the problem.\n   - If \"they\" refers to \"the developer,\" it implies that the developer had a better understanding of the problem, which would not logically explain why the secretary corrected the developer.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to definitively determine which individual \"they\" refers to.\n   - Without further context, both interpretations could be considered, but the logical flow of the sentence suggests that \"they\" is more likely to refer to \"the secretary.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical interpretation is that \"they\" refers to \"the secretary,\" as it provides a coherent reason for the action described in the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The secretary understood the problem"
