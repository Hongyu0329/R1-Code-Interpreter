    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals mentioned:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"him.\" It is used as the object of the verb \"gave.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Subjects and Objects**: \n   - The subject of the sentence is \"The chief.\"\n   - The objects in the sentence are \"the housekeeper\" and \"him.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Action**: The action described is that the chief thanked the housekeeper and gave \"him\" some tips.\n\n4. **Analyze the Context**: \n   - The chief is the one performing the action of giving.\n   - The housekeeper is the one being thanked.\n\n5. **Determine the Likely Antecedent**: \n   - Since the chief is the subject performing the action, it is logical to assume that the chief is giving tips to the housekeeper.\n   - The pronoun \"him\" is likely referring to the housekeeper, as it is common for the subject (the chief) to give something to the object (the housekeeper) in such a sentence structure.\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - There is no indication in the sentence that suggests the chief is giving tips to himself.\n   - The sentence structure and typical usage suggest that \"him\" refers to the housekeeper.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical interpretation is that the chief gave the housekeeper some tips.\n\n<<<answer>>>B"
