    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"them,\" which is used as the object of the verb \"gave.\" This means \"them\" is the recipient of the prototype.\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the carpenter\" and \"the designer.\" These are the possible antecedents for \"them.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave them a prototype.\" The subject of the sentence is \"The carpenter,\" and the action is \"collaborated with the designer and gave them a prototype.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**: \n   - The carpenter is the subject who performed the action of giving.\n   - The designer is the person with whom the carpenter collaborated.\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is used to refer to a plural noun or a singular non-binary individual. However, in this context, it is more likely to refer to the designer, as the carpenter is the one giving the prototype.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - The sentence does not explicitly state who \"them\" refers to, but based on typical sentence structure and the context of collaboration, it is more logical to assume that the carpenter gave the prototype to the designer.\n   - However, without additional context, it is not entirely clear, and one could argue that \"them\" could refer to both the carpenter and the designer collectively, though this is less likely.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"them\" refers to the designer, but the sentence could be considered ambiguous without further context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Gave the designer a prototype"
