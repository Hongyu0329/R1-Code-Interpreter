    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"The reporter and the chef will discuss their favorite dishes,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"their.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Nouns**: The nouns in the sentence are \"the reporter\" and \"the chef.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Antecedent**: The pronoun \"their\" is a possessive pronoun that refers to something owned or associated with the nouns mentioned. In this sentence, \"their\" is used to indicate possession of \"favorite dishes.\"\n\n4. **Analyze the Context**: The sentence states that \"The reporter and the chef will discuss their favorite dishes.\" The use of \"their\" suggests a collective possession or association with both \"the reporter\" and \"the chef.\" It implies that the favorite dishes belong to both individuals, not just one of them.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Options**:\n   - (A) They will discuss the reporter's favorite dishes: This option suggests that the favorite dishes belong only to the reporter, which does not align with the use of \"their\" indicating joint possession.\n   - (B) They will discuss the chef's favorite dishes: This option suggests that the favorite dishes belong only to the chef, which also does not align with the use of \"their\" indicating joint possession.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: This option suggests that it is unclear whose favorite dishes are being discussed. However, the use of \"their\" clearly indicates that the favorite dishes are associated with both the reporter and the chef.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The pronoun \"their\" in the sentence refers to both the reporter and the chef, indicating that the favorite dishes belong to both of them. Therefore, the sentence is not ambiguous in this context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is that the sentence is not ambiguous, and \"their\" refers to both the reporter and the chef.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
