    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved:\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its role**: The pronoun in question is \"him,\" which is an object pronoun. It is used to refer to a male individual who is the recipient of an action.\n\n2. **Identify the individuals involved**: The sentence mentions two individuals: \"the designer\" and \"the cook.\"\n\n3. **Determine the action and its direction**: The action in the sentence is \"asked for feedback.\" The designer is the subject who performs the action of showing a blueprint and asking for feedback.\n\n4. **Determine the likely recipient of the action**: The sentence structure suggests that the designer is asking someone for feedback. Since the designer is the one performing the action, it is logical to assume that the feedback is being requested from the other individual mentioned, which is \"the cook.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - (A) Asked the designer: This would imply that the designer asked himself for feedback, which is unlikely in the context of the sentence.\n   - (B) Asked the cook: This is the most logical interpretation, as the designer is likely asking the cook for feedback on the blueprint.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: This would mean that it is unclear who \"him\" refers to, but given the context, it seems clear that the designer is asking the cook.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"him\" refers to \"the cook.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Asked the cook"
