    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"The undergraduate\" and \"the scientist.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure:**\n   - The sentence is: \"The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist because he needed a lab assistant.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"because he needed a lab assistant.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Logical Relationship:**\n   - The sentence suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: the reason for the undergraduate's application is provided.\n   - The pronoun \"he\" is used in the context of needing a lab assistant, which is the reason for the action of applying.\n\n4. **Consider the Contextual Logic:**\n   - Typically, a lab assistant is needed by someone who is conducting research or experiments, which is more likely to be the scientist.\n   - The undergraduate is applying for a position, which implies that the position is available because someone (likely the scientist) needs assistance.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - (A) The undergraduate needed an assistant: This is less likely because the undergraduate is applying for a position, not creating one.\n   - (B) The scientist needed an assistant: This is more logical because the scientist would be the one needing a lab assistant, prompting the undergraduate to apply.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: While pronouns can sometimes be ambiguous, the context here leans towards the scientist needing the assistant.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the logical and contextual analysis, the pronoun \"he\" most likely refers to \"the scientist.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The scientist needed an assistant"
