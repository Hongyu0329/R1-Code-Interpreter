    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"The supervisor gave the employee feedback on his stellar performance,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two male nouns that could potentially be the antecedent of \"his\":\n   - \"The supervisor\"\n   - \"The employee\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The sentence structure suggests that the feedback is being given to the employee. Typically, feedback on performance is given to the person whose performance is being evaluated.\n   - The phrase \"his stellar performance\" follows the mention of \"the employee,\" which suggests a closer grammatical relationship between \"his\" and \"the employee.\"\n\n4. **Logical Interpretation**:\n   - It is more logical for the supervisor to give feedback to the employee about the employee's performance rather than the supervisor's own performance. Supervisors typically evaluate and provide feedback on the performance of their subordinates.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the sentence structure and logical interpretation, \"his\" most likely refers to \"the employee.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" is \"the employee.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) It was the employee's performance"
