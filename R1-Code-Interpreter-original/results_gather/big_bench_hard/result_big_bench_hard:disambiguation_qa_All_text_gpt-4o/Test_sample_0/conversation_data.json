    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male entities: \"the patient\" and \"the specialist.\" Either could potentially be the antecedent of \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**: The sentence states, \"The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition.\" The phrase \"because he had a rare skin condition\" provides the reason for the referral.\n\n4. **Logical Reasoning**:\n   - Typically, a patient is referred to a specialist due to the patient's medical condition, not the specialist's condition. \n   - Therefore, it is more logical to conclude that \"he\" refers to \"the patient,\" as the patient's rare skin condition is the reason for the referral.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**: While the sentence structure could technically allow for ambiguity, the logical context strongly suggests that \"he\" refers to \"the patient.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable antecedent for \"he\" is \"the patient.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
