    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male entities: \"The carpenter\" and \"the onlooker.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The carpenter told the onlooker that he had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The carpenter told the onlooker.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"that he had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - In English, the pronoun typically refers to the subject of the main clause unless context suggests otherwise.\n   - Here, \"The carpenter\" is the subject of the main clause, making it the more likely antecedent for \"he.\"\n   - There is no additional context provided in the sentence to suggest that \"the onlooker\" is the one who had been working on the house.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - If there were additional context or if the sentence were structured differently, it might be ambiguous.\n   - However, based on the given sentence and typical pronoun reference rules, \"he\" most likely refers to \"The carpenter.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"he\" is \"The carpenter.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The carpenter had been working on the house"
