    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"The educator\" and \"a student.\" The pronoun \"his\" could potentially refer to either of these individuals.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The sentence states that the educator was meeting with a student to discuss \"his grading policy.\"\n   - Typically, in an educational context, the person who has a grading policy is the educator, as they are responsible for setting and explaining grading criteria to students.\n   - It is less common for a student to have a grading policy, as students are usually subject to the policies set by educators or institutions.\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - Given the context of an educator discussing a grading policy, it is more logical to conclude that \"his\" refers to the educator's grading policy.\n   - The sentence structure and typical roles in an educational setting support this interpretation.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - While theoretically possible, it is unlikely that the student has a grading policy, making option (B) less plausible.\n   - The sentence does not provide any specific indication that would make the antecedent ambiguous in this context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"his\" refers to the educator's grading policy.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
