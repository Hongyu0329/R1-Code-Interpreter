    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"their,\" which is a possessive pronoun. It is used to indicate ownership or association with a noun. In this sentence, \"their\" is used to describe \"office.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two entities: \"the producers\" and \"Sam.\" These are the potential antecedents for the pronoun \"their.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**:\n   - The sentence begins with \"After meeting with the producers,\" which sets the context for the action that follows.\n   - \"Sam went to their office\" is the main clause, where \"Sam\" is the subject, \"went\" is the verb, and \"their office\" is the object of the preposition \"to.\"\n\n4. **Determine Logical Association**:\n   - \"Their\" is a plural possessive pronoun, which typically refers to a plural noun. In this sentence, \"the producers\" is a plural noun, while \"Sam\" is singular.\n   - The logical association is that \"their\" refers to \"the producers\" because it is plural and matches the number of the pronoun.\n\n5. **Consider Contextual Clarity**:\n   - The sentence structure and context suggest that \"their office\" is more likely to be associated with \"the producers\" rather than \"Sam.\"\n   - There is no indication in the sentence that \"Sam\" has an office that would be referred to as \"their office.\"\n\n6. **Evaluate Ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide any additional context that would make the antecedent of \"their\" ambiguous.\n   - The most straightforward interpretation is that \"their\" refers to \"the producers.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" is clear and refers to \"the producers.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
