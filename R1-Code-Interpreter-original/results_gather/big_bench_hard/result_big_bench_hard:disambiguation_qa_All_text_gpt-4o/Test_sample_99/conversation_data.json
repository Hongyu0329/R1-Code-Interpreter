    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context in which the pronoun is used.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"them.\"\n   - \"Them\" is an object pronoun, typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular non-binary noun.\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**:\n   - The sentence mentions two individuals: \"the designer\" and \"the carpenter.\"\n   - Both are singular nouns, so \"them\" cannot refer to either one individually if we assume traditional singular/plural usage.\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**:\n   - The sentence structure is: \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint.\"\n   - The action of giving a blueprint follows the collaboration, suggesting that the blueprint is given to one or both of the individuals involved in the collaboration.\n\n4. **Consider the Use of \"Them\"**:\n   - In standard English, \"them\" is used for plural antecedents or as a singular non-binary pronoun.\n   - Since both \"the designer\" and \"the carpenter\" are singular and traditionally gendered, \"them\" would not typically refer to either one individually in a standard context.\n\n5. **Determine Ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context to clarify whether the blueprint was given to the designer, the carpenter, or both.\n   - Without further context, it is unclear which individual received the blueprint.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the lack of clarity and the use of \"them,\" the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
