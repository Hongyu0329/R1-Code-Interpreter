    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"The reporter and the chef discussed his favorite dishes,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"his\" in the sentence are \"the reporter\" and \"the chef.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence structure is \"The reporter and the chef discussed his favorite dishes.\"\n   - The pronoun \"his\" is singular, which means it refers to one person, not both.\n\n4. **Determine Contextual Clarity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to specify whether \"his\" refers to \"the reporter\" or \"the chef.\"\n   - Both \"the reporter\" and \"the chef\" are equally plausible antecedents for \"his\" because the sentence does not indicate a preference or provide additional information.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since there is no clear indication or context to determine whether \"his\" refers to \"the reporter\" or \"the chef,\" the antecedent of \"his\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
