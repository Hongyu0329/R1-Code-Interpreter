    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"him.\" It is used as the object of the verb \"told.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male individuals: \"the construction worker\" and \"the editor.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"him.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The construction worker called the editor and told him the whole story.\"\n   - The subject of the sentence is \"The construction worker.\"\n   - The construction worker performed two actions: \"called the editor\" and \"told him the whole story.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - The construction worker is the one performing the actions, and the editor is the one being called.\n   - The pronoun \"him\" follows the action of \"told,\" which is performed by the construction worker.\n   - In typical sentence structure, when two actions are performed by the same subject, the object of the second action (in this case, \"told him\") is often the same as the object of the first action (in this case, \"called the editor\").\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the sentence structure and typical grammatical conventions, \"him\" most likely refers to \"the editor,\" as the construction worker is telling the story to the person he called, which is the editor.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of \"him\" is \"the editor.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Told the editor the story"
