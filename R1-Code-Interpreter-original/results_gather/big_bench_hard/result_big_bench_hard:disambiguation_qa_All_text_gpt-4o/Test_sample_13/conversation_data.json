    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided:\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence is \"This story could not be published without the writer and their friends' support.\"\n\n2. **Pronoun Identification**: The pronoun in question is \"their.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The sentence mentions \"the writer and their friends' support.\"\n   - The pronoun \"their\" is used to indicate possession or association with \"friends' support.\"\n\n4. **Antecedent Identification**:\n   - The structure \"the writer and their friends\" suggests that \"their\" is referring to the entity that possesses or is associated with the \"friends.\"\n   - The most logical interpretation is that \"their\" refers to the writer, as it is common to use \"their\" as a singular pronoun to refer to a person when gender is not specified.\n\n5. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) They were the writer's friends: This option suggests that \"their\" refers to the writer, which aligns with the logical interpretation.\n   - (B) They were the friends' friends: This option suggests a second layer of friends, which is not indicated in the sentence.\n   - (C) They were the story's friends: This option is illogical as a story does not have friends.\n   - (D) Ambiguous: This option suggests that the antecedent is unclear, but given the context, \"their\" logically refers to the writer.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"their\" is the writer, making option (A) the correct choice.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) They were the writer's friends"
