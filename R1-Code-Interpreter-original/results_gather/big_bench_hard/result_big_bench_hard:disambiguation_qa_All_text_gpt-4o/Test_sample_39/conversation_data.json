    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and meaning of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Context**: The pronoun in question is \"they,\" which appears in the options provided. The sentence itself does not explicitly contain the pronoun \"they,\" but the options suggest that \"they\" is referring to a group of friends.\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is: \"This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support.\" Here, \"the writer and her friends\" is a compound subject that provides support for the story's publication.\n\n3. **Determine the Antecedent**: \n   - The phrase \"the writer and her friends\" indicates that the writer has friends who are providing support.\n   - The pronoun \"they\" in the options is likely referring to \"her friends\" since \"they\" is a plural pronoun and \"friends\" is a plural noun.\n\n4. **Analyze the Options**:\n   - (A) \"They were the writer's friends\": This option suggests that \"they\" refers to the friends of the writer, which aligns with the sentence structure where \"her friends\" are part of the support system.\n   - (B) \"They were the friends' friends\": This option suggests a second layer of friends, which is not indicated in the sentence.\n   - (C) \"They were the story's friends\": This option is not logical as a story does not have friends.\n   - (D) \"Ambiguous\": This option would be valid if the sentence structure did not clearly indicate the antecedent, but in this case, the sentence structure points to \"her friends.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the writer's friends,\" as indicated in option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
