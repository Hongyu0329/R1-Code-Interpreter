    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two female nouns that could be the antecedent of \"she\":\n   - \"The hygienist\"\n   - \"The patient\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**: \n   - The sentence is structured as \"The hygienist told the patient that she should floss every day.\"\n   - The hygienist is the one giving advice or instructions to the patient.\n   - Typically, in a dental context, it is the patient who is advised to floss every day, not the hygienist. The hygienist is likely already aware of the importance of flossing and is passing this advice to the patient.\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - Given the context of a dental appointment, it is more logical that the hygienist is advising the patient to floss every day.\n   - Therefore, \"she\" most likely refers to \"the patient.\"\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - While the sentence could technically be interpreted as the hygienist advising herself, this is less likely given the context and typical roles in a dental setting.\n   - The sentence does not provide explicit clarification, but the context strongly suggests that \"she\" refers to \"the patient.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"she\" refers to \"the patient.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The patient should floss"
