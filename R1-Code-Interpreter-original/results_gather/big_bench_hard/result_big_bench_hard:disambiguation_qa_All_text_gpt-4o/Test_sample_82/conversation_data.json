    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n\n2. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two potential antecedents for \"they\": \"The surgeon\" and \"the nurse.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The surgeon warned the nurse that they needed more time to prepare.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The surgeon warned the nurse,\" and the subordinate clause is \"that they needed more time to prepare.\"\n\n4. **Consider Context and Common Usage**:\n   - In English, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause, it typically refers to the subject of the main clause unless context suggests otherwise.\n   - However, \"they\" is a plural pronoun, which complicates the matter because both \"the surgeon\" and \"the nurse\" are singular nouns.\n\n5. **Evaluate Ambiguity**:\n   - The use of \"they\" as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun is becoming more common, but traditionally, \"they\" is plural.\n   - Without additional context, it is unclear whether \"they\" refers to \"the surgeon,\" \"the nurse,\" or both collectively.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the lack of additional context and the traditional use of \"they\" as a plural pronoun, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
