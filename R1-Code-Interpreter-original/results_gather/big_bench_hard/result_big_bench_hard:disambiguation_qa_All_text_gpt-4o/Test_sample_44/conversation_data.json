    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the investigator\" and \"the witness.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure:**\n   - The sentence is: \"The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but he was too late.\"\n   - The sentence consists of two main parts: \n     - \"The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person,\"\n     - \"but he was too late.\"\n\n3. **Understand the Context:**\n   - The first part of the sentence indicates that the investigator had the intention to interview the witness.\n   - The second part of the sentence introduces a contrast with the word \"but,\" suggesting that something prevented the intended action from happening.\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent:**\n   - The phrase \"he was too late\" suggests that someone was late for the intended action (interviewing the witness).\n   - The logical interpretation is that the investigator, who wanted to conduct the interview, was the one who was too late to do so.\n   - The sentence structure and context imply that the investigator's lateness is the reason the interview did not occur as planned.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity:**\n   - While it is theoretically possible for \"he\" to refer to the witness, the context of the sentence makes it more logical for \"he\" to refer to the investigator.\n   - The sentence does not provide any indication that the witness had a role in being late for the interview.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"he\" is \"the investigator.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The investigator was too late"
