    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence \"The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave them a discount,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context in which the pronoun is used.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"them.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two entities: \"the carpenter\" and \"the clerk.\" These are the possible antecedents for the pronoun \"them.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave them a discount.\"\n   - The main action is performed by \"the carpenter,\" who made a desk for \"the clerk.\"\n\n4. **Determine Logical Antecedent**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is used after the action of giving a discount. \n   - Typically, in English, when a service or product is provided, any discount associated with it is usually given to the recipient of the service or product, not the provider.\n   - In this context, the desk is made for \"the clerk,\" making \"the clerk\" the recipient of the desk.\n\n5. **Logical Conclusion**:\n   - It is logical to conclude that the discount would be given to \"the clerk,\" as they are the recipient of the desk and likely the customer in this transaction.\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not explicitly state who receives the discount, but based on typical transactional logic, the recipient of the product or service (the clerk) is the one who would receive a discount.\n   - There is no indication that the carpenter would give themselves a discount, as that would not make sense in this context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"them\" is \"the clerk.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Gave the clerk a discount"
