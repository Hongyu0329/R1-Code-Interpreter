    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"her,\" which is a possessive pronoun. It indicates ownership or association with a female noun.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two potential antecedents:\n   - \"Sam\"\n   - \"the producers\"\n\n3. **Determine Gender Association**: \n   - \"Sam\" is a name that can be used for both males and females, but in this context, we assume \"Sam\" is female because \"her\" is used, which is a possessive pronoun for females.\n   - \"the producers\" is a plural noun and does not match the singular possessive pronoun \"her.\"\n\n4. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence structure \"After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office\" suggests that the action of going to the office is performed by Sam. The possessive pronoun \"her\" is most logically linked to the subject of the sentence, which is \"Sam.\"\n\n5. **Consider Contextual Clarity**: \n   - There is no indication in the sentence that the office belongs to the producers. The sentence directly associates the action of going to the office with Sam, making it more likely that \"her office\" refers to Sam's office.\n\n6. **Evaluate Ambiguity**: \n   - The sentence does not provide any explicit information that would suggest the office belongs to the producers. Therefore, the most straightforward interpretation is that \"her\" refers to Sam.\n\nBased on the analysis, the antecedent of \"her\" is most likely \"Sam,\" making it Sam's office.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
