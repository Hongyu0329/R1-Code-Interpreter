    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. Identify the pronoun: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. Determine the possible antecedents: The sentence mentions two people, Alex and Taylor. Therefore, \"he\" could potentially refer to either Alex or Taylor.\n\n3. Analyze the sentence structure: The sentence is structured as \"Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.\" The main clause is \"Alex did not know Taylor,\" and the subordinate clause is \"Before he sent the letter.\"\n\n4. Consider the logical flow: The sentence implies a sequence of events. The action of sending the letter occurs before Alex knowing Taylor. The pronoun \"he\" is in the subordinate clause, which typically refers to the subject of the main clause unless context suggests otherwise.\n\n5. Evaluate the context: The sentence does not provide additional context to clarify who \"he\" refers to. Without further information, it is not clear whether Alex or Taylor sent the letter.\n\n6. Determine ambiguity: Since the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively identify whether \"he\" refers to Alex or Taylor, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> C"
