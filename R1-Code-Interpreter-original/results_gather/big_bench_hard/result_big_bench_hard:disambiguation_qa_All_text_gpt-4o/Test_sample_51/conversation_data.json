    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"her,\" which is a possessive pronoun. It indicates ownership or association with a female individual.\n\n2. **Identify the Possible Antecedents**: In the sentence, there are two potential female antecedents:\n   - \"The developer\"\n   - \"The designer\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The developer met with the designer because her idea can be implemented.\" The pronoun \"her\" is used to refer to someone whose idea can be implemented.\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**: \n   - The sentence states that the developer met with the designer. The reason for the meeting is given as \"because her idea can be implemented.\"\n   - The pronoun \"her\" is more likely to refer to the person who is the subject of the reason clause, which is \"the designer\" in this context. This is because the sentence structure suggests that the meeting was prompted by the designer's idea being implementable.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - While the sentence structure suggests that \"her\" refers to \"the designer,\" it is technically possible for \"her\" to refer to \"the developer\" if the developer is female. However, without additional context, the sentence leans towards \"the designer\" as the antecedent.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the sentence structure and typical usage, \"her\" most likely refers to \"the designer.\" However, without explicit context indicating the gender of the developer, there is a slight possibility of ambiguity. Despite this, the sentence is more naturally interpreted as referring to the designer's idea.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The designer's idea could be implemented"
