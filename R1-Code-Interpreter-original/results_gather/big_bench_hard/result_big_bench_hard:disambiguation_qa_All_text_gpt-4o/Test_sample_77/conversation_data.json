    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The technician told the customer that they could pay with cash,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n\n2. **Identify potential antecedents**: The potential antecedents for \"they\" are \"the technician\" and \"the customer.\"\n\n3. **Analyze sentence structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as \"The technician told the customer that they could pay with cash.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The technician told the customer.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"that they could pay with cash.\"\n\n4. **Determine the logical antecedent**:\n   - In typical English usage, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause, it often refers to the subject of the main clause. However, this is not a strict rule and can vary based on context.\n   - In this sentence, \"they\" could logically refer to either \"the technician\" or \"the customer,\" as both could potentially be involved in a transaction involving payment.\n\n5. **Consider context and common usage**:\n   - Without additional context, it is unclear who is actually making the payment. Both the technician and the customer could be the ones paying, depending on the situation (e.g., the technician could be paying for something on behalf of the customer, or the customer could be paying for a service).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the sentence does not provide enough context to definitively determine whether \"they\" refers to \"the technician\" or \"the customer,\" the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
