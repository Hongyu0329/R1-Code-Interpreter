    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"The manager\" and \"the secretary.\" Both are potential antecedents for the pronoun \"she.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as: \"The manager sent a message to the secretary, but she didn't reply yet.\"\n   - The pronoun \"she\" appears in the second clause of the sentence, which is connected to the first clause by the conjunction \"but.\"\n\n4. **Consider Contextual Clues**:\n   - The first clause states that \"The manager sent a message to the secretary.\" This implies an action initiated by the manager towards the secretary.\n   - The second clause, \"but she didn't reply yet,\" suggests a response or lack thereof to the action mentioned in the first clause.\n\n5. **Logical Inference**:\n   - Typically, when someone sends a message, the expected response would be from the recipient of the message. In this case, the recipient is \"the secretary.\"\n   - Therefore, it is logical to infer that \"she\" refers to \"the secretary,\" as it is the secretary who would be expected to reply to the message sent by the manager.\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - While it is possible for pronouns to be ambiguous, in this context, the logical flow of the sentence suggests that \"she\" is more likely to refer to \"the secretary\" rather than \"the manager.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable antecedent for \"she\" is \"the secretary.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The secretary didn't reply yet"
