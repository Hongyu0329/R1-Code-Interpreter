    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"them.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two entities: \"the salesperson\" and \"the writer.\" These are the possible antecedents for the pronoun \"them.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold them some garbage.\"\n   - The main action is performed by \"the salesperson,\" who is trying to fool \"the writer.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Likely Antecedent**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is used in the context of the action \"sold them some garbage.\"\n   - The action of selling garbage is typically directed towards a recipient. In this context, the recipient of the garbage is likely to be the one who is being fooled.\n   - The sentence suggests that the salesperson is trying to fool \"the writer,\" which implies that \"the writer\" is the one being sold garbage.\n\n5. **Consider the Options**:\n   - Option (A) suggests that the salesperson sold garbage to themselves, which does not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.\n   - Option (B) suggests that the writer is the one who was sold garbage, which aligns with the logical flow of the sentence.\n   - Option (C) suggests ambiguity, but given the context, the sentence is not ambiguous because the logical recipient of the garbage is the writer.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the pronoun \"them\" refers to \"the writer.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Sold the writer some garbage"
