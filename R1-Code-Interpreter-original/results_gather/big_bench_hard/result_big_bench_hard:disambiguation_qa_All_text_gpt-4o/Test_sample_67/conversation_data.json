    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Context**: The pronoun in question is \"her,\" which is a possessive pronoun. It is used to indicate ownership or association with a female noun.\n\n2. **Identify the Female Nouns in the Sentence**: The sentence contains two female nouns: \"the pathologist\" and \"the victim.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Likely Antecedent**:\n   - The sentence describes an action performed by the pathologist: obtaining tissue samples from the victim.\n   - The phrase \"to look at under her microscope\" suggests that the microscope is used for examining the tissue samples.\n   - Typically, a pathologist would use their own equipment, such as a microscope, to examine samples. This is a standard practice in medical and forensic settings.\n\n4. **Consider the Contextual Likelihood**:\n   - It is more plausible that the pathologist is using her own microscope to examine the samples, as this is part of her professional role.\n   - There is no indication in the sentence that the victim would have a microscope or that it would be relevant to the context of examining tissue samples.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Options**:\n   - Option (A) suggests that the microscope belongs to the pathologist, which aligns with the typical scenario and context.\n   - Option (B) suggests that the microscope belongs to the victim, which is less likely given the context.\n   - Option (C) suggests ambiguity, but the context strongly favors the pathologist as the owner of the microscope.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"her\" is the pathologist. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) It was the pathologist's microscope"
