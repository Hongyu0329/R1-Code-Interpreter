    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The assistant asked the physician if she needs any help,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Nouns**: The nouns in the sentence are \"assistant\" and \"physician.\"\n\n3. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The pronoun \"she\" could refer to either \"the assistant\" or \"the physician,\" as both are female-gendered nouns.\n\n4. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: The sentence structure is \"The assistant asked the physician if she needs any help.\" The pronoun \"she\" follows the clause \"asked the physician,\" which could imply that the question is directed towards the physician. However, without additional context, it is not definitively clear whether \"she\" refers to the assistant or the physician.\n\n5. **Consider Contextual Clues**: In the absence of additional context or specific indicators within the sentence, it is difficult to determine with certainty which noun \"she\" refers to.\n\n6. **Determine Ambiguity**: Since the sentence does not provide enough information to clearly identify whether \"she\" refers to the assistant or the physician, the antecedent of \"she\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
