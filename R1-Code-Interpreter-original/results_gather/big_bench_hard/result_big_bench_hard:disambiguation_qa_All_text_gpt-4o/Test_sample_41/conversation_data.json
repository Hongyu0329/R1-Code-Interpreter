    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"them.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two potential antecedents for \"them\": \"the cleaner\" and \"the guard.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**:\n   - The sentence is: \"The cleaner called the guard and asked them to open the door.\"\n   - The structure suggests that \"the cleaner\" is the subject who performed the action of calling.\n   - \"The guard\" is the object of the action of calling.\n\n4. **Determine the Action**: The action in question is \"asked them to open the door.\" The pronoun \"them\" is used to refer to the person who is being asked to perform the action of opening the door.\n\n5. **Logical Analysis**:\n   - It is logical to assume that the cleaner, who initiated the call, is asking the guard to open the door. This is because guards are typically responsible for security tasks such as opening doors.\n   - Therefore, \"them\" is more likely to refer to \"the guard.\"\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - The sentence does not explicitly state who \"them\" refers to, but based on typical roles and the context provided, it is reasonable to conclude that \"them\" refers to \"the guard.\"\n   - There is no strong indication that \"them\" refers to \"the cleaner,\" as it would be unusual for the cleaner to ask themselves to open the door.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"them\" is \"the guard.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Asked the guard"
