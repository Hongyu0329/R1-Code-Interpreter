    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The scientist collaborated with the artist, and she shared a story,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"she\" are \"the scientist\" and \"the artist,\" as these are the two female nouns mentioned in the sentence.\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: The sentence is composed of two clauses: \"The scientist collaborated with the artist\" and \"she shared a story.\" The pronoun \"she\" appears in the second clause.\n\n4. **Consider Context and Clarity**: \n   - In English, when a pronoun is used, it typically refers to the most recently mentioned noun of the same gender, unless context clearly indicates otherwise.\n   - In this sentence, both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" are mentioned in the first clause, and there is no additional context provided to clarify which one \"she\" refers to.\n\n5. **Determine Ambiguity**: \n   - Since both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" are equally likely to be the antecedent of \"she\" based on their positions in the sentence and there is no additional context to clarify, the pronoun \"she\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the antecedent of \"she\" is not clear, and the pronoun is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
