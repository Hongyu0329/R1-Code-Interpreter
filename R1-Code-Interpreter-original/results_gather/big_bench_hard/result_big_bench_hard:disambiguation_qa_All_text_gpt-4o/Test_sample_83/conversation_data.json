    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\" The possible antecedents in the sentence are \"the worker\" and \"the pedestrian.\"\n\n2. **Examine the sentence structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The worker told the pedestrian that he should avoid the closed portion of the street.\" The pronoun \"he\" appears in the clause \"that he should avoid the closed portion of the street.\"\n\n3. **Determine the subject of the main clause**: The main clause is \"The worker told the pedestrian.\" Here, \"the worker\" is the subject, and \"the pedestrian\" is the object of the verb \"told.\"\n\n4. **Analyze the subordinate clause**: The subordinate clause is \"that he should avoid the closed portion of the street.\" The pronoun \"he\" is the subject of this clause.\n\n5. **Consider logical context and typical usage**: In typical usage, when someone is told to do something, the person being told (the object of the verb \"told\") is usually the one expected to take action. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that \"he\" refers to \"the pedestrian,\" as the pedestrian is the one being told to avoid the closed portion of the street.\n\n6. **Check for ambiguity**: Although the sentence structure and typical usage suggest that \"he\" refers to \"the pedestrian,\" the sentence does not explicitly clarify this. Therefore, there is a potential for ambiguity, as one could argue that \"he\" might refer to \"the worker\" if additional context were provided.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"he\" is \"the pedestrian,\" but the sentence could be considered ambiguous without further context.\n\nGiven the options:\n(A) The worker should avoid the closed portion\n(B) The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion\n(C) Ambiguous\n\nThe most appropriate choice, considering the typical interpretation and potential for ambiguity, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion"
