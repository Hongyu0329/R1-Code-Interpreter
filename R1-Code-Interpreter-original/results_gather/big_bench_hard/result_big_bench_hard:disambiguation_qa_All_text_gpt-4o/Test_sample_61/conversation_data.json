    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"Bailey planned to meet the director at her office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"her.\"\n   - The possible antecedents for \"her\" are \"Bailey\" and \"the director.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Context:**\n   - The sentence states that Bailey is planning to meet the director at \"her office.\"\n   - In English, when a pronoun like \"her\" is used, it typically refers to the most recent female noun mentioned, unless context suggests otherwise.\n\n3. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent:**\n   - The most recent female noun before \"her\" is \"the director.\"\n   - Therefore, the default assumption is that \"her\" refers to \"the director.\"\n\n4. **Consider the Options:**\n   - (A) The office was the director's office: This option aligns with the typical grammatical structure where \"her\" refers to the most recent female noun, which is \"the director.\"\n   - (B) The office was Bailey's office: This would require additional context or a different sentence structure to support, as \"Bailey\" is mentioned earlier in the sentence.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: This would be the case if there were no clear grammatical or contextual clues to determine the antecedent, but in this sentence, the structure suggests \"the director\" as the antecedent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the sentence structure and typical grammatical rules, the most logical antecedent for \"her\" is \"the director.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
