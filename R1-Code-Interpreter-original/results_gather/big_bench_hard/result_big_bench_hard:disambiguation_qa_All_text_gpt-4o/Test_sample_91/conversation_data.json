    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"Alex did not know Taylor until he sent a letter,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"he\" are \"Alex\" and \"Taylor,\" as they are the only male names mentioned in the sentence.\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"Alex did not know Taylor until he sent a letter.\" The pronoun \"he\" follows the clause \"Alex did not know Taylor,\" and it is part of the clause \"until he sent a letter.\"\n\n4. **Consider Context and Logic**: \n   - If \"he\" refers to \"Alex,\" the sentence implies that Alex sent a letter, which led to him knowing Taylor.\n   - If \"he\" refers to \"Taylor,\" the sentence implies that Taylor sent a letter, which led to Alex knowing him.\n\n5. **Evaluate Ambiguity**: \n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to definitively determine whether \"he\" refers to Alex or Taylor.\n   - Both interpretations are logically possible: either Alex sent a letter to Taylor, or Taylor sent a letter to Alex.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without additional context or information, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous. The sentence does not clearly indicate whether Alex or Taylor sent the letter.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
