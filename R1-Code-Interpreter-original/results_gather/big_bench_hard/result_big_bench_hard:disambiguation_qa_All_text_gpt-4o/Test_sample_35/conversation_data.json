    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"My parent called his secretary for more information,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"my parent\" and \"his secretary.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure:**\n   - The sentence is structured as \"My parent called his secretary for more information.\"\n   - The pronoun \"his\" is possessive, indicating ownership or association.\n\n3. **Determine the most likely antecedent:**\n   - \"His\" is typically used to refer to a male individual. In this context, it is used to indicate possession of the secretary.\n   - The sentence suggests that \"my parent\" is the one who possesses or is associated with the secretary, as it is common for individuals to have their own secretaries.\n\n4. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - Option (A): \"They were my parent's secretary\" suggests that \"his\" refers to \"my parent,\" which aligns with the typical use of possessive pronouns.\n   - Option (B): \"They were the secretary's secretary\" suggests that \"his\" refers to \"the secretary,\" which is less likely because it would imply a secretary having another secretary, which is not a common scenario.\n   - Option (C): \"Ambiguous\" would be appropriate if the sentence structure or context did not clearly indicate the antecedent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"his\" is \"my parent,\" as it is common for individuals to have secretaries, and the sentence structure supports this interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
