    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the entities involved:\n\n1. **Identify the entities**: \n   - The sentence involves two main entities: \"the writer\" and \"the salesperson.\"\n\n2. **Understand the action**:\n   - The sentence describes two actions: \"tried to fool\" and \"told a fake story.\"\n\n3. **Determine the subject of the actions**:\n   - \"The writer\" is the subject of both actions: \"tried to fool\" and \"told a fake story.\"\n\n4. **Identify the object of the actions**:\n   - The object of \"tried to fool\" is \"the salesperson.\"\n   - The pronoun \"them\" in \"told them a fake story\" needs to be identified.\n\n5. **Analyze the pronoun \"them\"**:\n   - Since \"the writer\" is the subject performing the action of telling a fake story, \"them\" refers to the recipient of the story.\n   - The recipient of the story, in the context of trying to fool someone, is logically \"the salesperson.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" refers to \"the salesperson\" because the writer is trying to fool the salesperson by telling a fake story.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Told the salesperson a fake story"
