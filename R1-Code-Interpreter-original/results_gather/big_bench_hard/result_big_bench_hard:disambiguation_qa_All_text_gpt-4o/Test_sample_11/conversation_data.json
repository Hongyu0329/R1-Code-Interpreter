    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"Bailey planned to meet the director at his office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two male nouns that could potentially be the antecedent for \"his\": \"Bailey\" and \"the director.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence structure suggests that \"his office\" is the location where the meeting is planned to take place.\n   - Typically, when a sentence is structured with a plan to meet someone at \"his office,\" it is common for the office to belong to the person being met, which in this case is \"the director.\"\n\n4. **Consider Common Usage and Context**: \n   - In common usage, when someone plans to meet another person at \"his office,\" it usually implies that the office belongs to the person being met, unless otherwise specified.\n   - There is no additional context provided in the sentence to suggest that the office belongs to Bailey.\n\n5. **Evaluate Options**:\n   - (A) The office was the director's office: This option aligns with the common interpretation that the office belongs to the person being met.\n   - (B) The office was Bailey's office: This option is less likely given the sentence structure and common usage.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: While theoretically possible, the sentence structure and common usage strongly suggest that the office belongs to the director.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical and common interpretation is that the office belongs to the director.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
