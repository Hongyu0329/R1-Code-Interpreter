    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\" It is used as the subject of the verb \"used.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the developer\" and \"the writer.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"they.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they used big words.\" The pronoun \"they\" follows the clause \"because,\" which provides a reason for the developer's inability to communicate.\n\n4. **Consider Logical Context**: The sentence implies that the use of big words is the reason for the communication issue. Therefore, the person who uses big words is likely the one causing the communication barrier.\n\n5. **Evaluate Each Option**:\n   - **Option (A): The developer uses big words**: If the developer is the one using big words, it would not logically explain why the developer is unable to communicate with the writer. The sentence suggests that the use of big words is a barrier for the developer, not caused by the developer.\n   - **Option (B): The writer uses big words**: If the writer is the one using big words, it makes sense that the developer is unable to communicate with the writer due to the writer's use of complex language.\n   - **Option (C): Ambiguous**: The sentence does not provide explicit clarification on who \"they\" refers to, but the logical context suggests that the writer's use of big words is the cause of the communication issue.\n\n6. **Determine the Most Logical Antecedent**: Based on the logical context and the structure of the sentence, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"they\" refers to \"the writer,\" as this explains the communication barrier.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The writer uses big words"
