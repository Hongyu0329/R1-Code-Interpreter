    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male entities: \"the mechanic\" and \"the receptionist.\" Both are potential antecedents for \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The mechanic greets the receptionist because he was in a good mood.\" The pronoun \"he\" follows the action of greeting, which is performed by \"the mechanic.\"\n\n4. **Consider the Context**: The sentence provides a reason for the mechanic's action of greeting the receptionist. The phrase \"because he was in a good mood\" suggests that the mood of the person performing the action (the mechanic) is the reason for the action.\n\n5. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**: Given the structure and context, it is more logical to conclude that \"he\" refers to \"the mechanic.\" The sentence implies that the mechanic's good mood is the reason he greets the receptionist.\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**: While it is technically possible for \"he\" to refer to \"the receptionist,\" the sentence structure and context make it more likely that \"he\" refers to \"the mechanic.\" Therefore, the antecedent is not ambiguous in this context.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely antecedent for \"he\" is \"the mechanic.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The mechanic was in a good mood"
