    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The visitor told the teacher that he liked the cake,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"he\" in the sentence are \"the visitor\" and \"the teacher.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as \"The visitor told the teacher that he liked the cake.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The visitor told the teacher.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"that he liked the cake.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - In English, the pronoun \"he\" typically refers to the subject of the main clause unless context or additional information suggests otherwise.\n   - Here, \"the visitor\" is the subject of the main clause, making it the more likely antecedent for \"he.\"\n\n5. **Consider Context and Ambiguity**:\n   - Without additional context, it is not explicitly clear whether \"he\" refers to \"the visitor\" or \"the teacher.\"\n   - The sentence does not provide specific information to definitively assign \"he\" to either \"the visitor\" or \"the teacher.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Due to the lack of explicit context or additional information, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
