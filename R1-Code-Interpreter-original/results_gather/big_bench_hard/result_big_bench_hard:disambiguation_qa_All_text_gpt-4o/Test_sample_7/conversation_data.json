    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"them.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the guard\" and \"the cleaner.\" These are the possible antecedents for the pronoun \"them.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The guard called the cleaner and asked them to open the door.\"\n   - The subject of the sentence is \"The guard.\"\n   - The action performed by the guard is \"called the cleaner.\"\n   - The guard then \"asked them to open the door.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" follows the action \"asked,\" which is performed by the guard.\n   - The guard is asking someone to perform an action (open the door).\n   - The most logical interpretation is that the guard is asking the cleaner to open the door, as the cleaner is the one being called and presumably the one being asked to perform the task.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - In English, \"them\" is typically used as a plural pronoun or a singular gender-neutral pronoun.\n   - However, in this context, \"them\" is used to refer to a singular person, which is common in modern usage for gender neutrality.\n   - The sentence does not provide any additional context that would suggest ambiguity between the guard and the cleaner.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"them\" is \"the cleaner,\" as the guard is asking the cleaner to open the door.\n\n<<<answer>>>B"
