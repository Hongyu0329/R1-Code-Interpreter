    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\" It is used as the subject of the verb \"understood.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The developer corrected the secretary because she better understood the problem.\" The main clause is \"The developer corrected the secretary,\" and the subordinate clause is \"because she better understood the problem.\"\n\n3. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two female entities: \"the developer\" and \"the secretary.\" Either could potentially be the antecedent of \"she.\"\n\n4. **Analyze the Context**: The sentence provides a reason for the action of correcting: \"because she better understood the problem.\" This implies that the person who \"better understood the problem\" is the reason for the correction.\n\n5. **Consider Logical Interpretation**: \n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the developer,\" it suggests that the developer corrected the secretary because the developer herself had a better understanding of the problem.\n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the secretary,\" it suggests that the developer corrected the secretary because the secretary had a better understanding of the problem, which seems less logical as it would not typically be a reason for correction.\n\n6. **Evaluate Ambiguity**: The sentence does not provide explicit information to definitively determine which person \"she\" refers to. Both interpretations are grammatically possible, but the context does not clearly favor one over the other.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of clear contextual clues, the antecedent of \"she\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
