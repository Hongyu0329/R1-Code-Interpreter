    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"their.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two entities: \"The educator\" and \"a student.\" Therefore, \"their\" could potentially refer to either the educator or the student.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**: \n   - The sentence states that the educator was meeting with a student to discuss \"their grading policy.\"\n   - In educational contexts, it is more common for educators to have grading policies rather than students. Grading policies are typically set by educators or institutions, not by individual students.\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - Given the context, it is more logical to assume that \"their grading policy\" refers to the educator's grading policy. This is because educators are responsible for creating and explaining grading policies to students.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - While it is theoretically possible for a student to have a personal grading policy (e.g., a personal standard or goal), this is not a common interpretation in the context of a meeting between an educator and a student.\n   - The sentence does not provide any specific indication that the student has a grading policy, making the interpretation that it refers to the educator's policy more straightforward.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"their\" refers to the educator's grading policy.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) It was the educator's grading policy"
