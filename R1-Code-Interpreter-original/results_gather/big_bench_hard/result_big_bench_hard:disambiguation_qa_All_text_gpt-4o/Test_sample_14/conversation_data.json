    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave her some tips,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. Identify the pronoun: The pronoun in question is \"her.\"\n\n2. Determine the possible antecedents: The sentence mentions two people, \"the chief\" and \"the housekeeper.\" The pronoun \"her\" could potentially refer to either of these individuals, but we need to determine which one is more likely based on the sentence structure.\n\n3. Analyze the sentence structure: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave her some tips.\" The subject of the sentence is \"The chief,\" and the actions performed by the chief are \"thanked\" and \"gave.\"\n\n4. Consider the logical flow: The chief is the one performing the actions, and the housekeeper is the recipient of the thanks. The pronoun \"her\" follows the mention of the housekeeper, which suggests that \"her\" is likely referring to the housekeeper.\n\n5. Evaluate the options:\n   - Option (A) \"Gave the chief some tips\" suggests that \"her\" refers to the chief. However, this is unlikely because \"her\" is typically used for female antecedents, and \"chief\" is not specified as female in the sentence.\n   - Option (B) \"Gave the housekeeper some tips\" suggests that \"her\" refers to the housekeeper. This is consistent with the sentence structure and the typical use of \"her\" for female antecedents.\n   - Option (C) \"Ambiguous\" would apply if there were no clear indication of which person \"her\" refers to. However, the sentence structure and context provide a clear indication.\n\n6. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the pronoun \"her\" most likely refers to the housekeeper.\n\n<<<answer>>>B"
