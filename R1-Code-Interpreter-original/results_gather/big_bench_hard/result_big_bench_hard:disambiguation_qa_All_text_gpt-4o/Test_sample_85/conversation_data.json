    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to their office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. Identify the pronoun: The pronoun in question is \"their.\"\n\n2. Determine the possible antecedents: The sentence mentions two entities: \"Sam\" and \"the producers.\"\n\n3. Analyze the possessive pronoun \"their\": The pronoun \"their\" is a possessive pronoun, which typically refers to a plural noun or a singular noun that is gender-neutral or non-binary. In this sentence, \"their\" is most likely referring to a plural noun.\n\n4. Match the pronoun with the possible antecedents:\n   - \"Sam\" is a singular noun, so it is unlikely that \"their\" refers to Sam.\n   - \"The producers\" is a plural noun, which aligns with the use of \"their.\"\n\n5. Consider the context: The sentence structure suggests that Sam is going to the office of the producers after meeting with them. This implies that \"their office\" is likely referring to the office of the producers.\n\n6. Evaluate ambiguity: There is no indication in the sentence that suggests \"their\" could refer to Sam. The context and grammatical structure strongly suggest that \"their\" refers to \"the producers.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" is \"the producers.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) It is the producers' office"
