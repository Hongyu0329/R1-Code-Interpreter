    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the lawyer\" and \"the cashier.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure:**\n   - The sentence is: \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because she needed to understand the case.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"because she needed to understand the case.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Logical Antecedent:**\n   - The subordinate clause \"because she needed to understand the case\" provides a reason for the action in the main clause.\n   - The action in the main clause is performed by \"the lawyer\" (i.e., \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations\").\n   - It is logical to assume that the reason for the lawyer's action is that the lawyer herself needed to understand the case.\n\n4. **Consider Contextual Clarity:**\n   - In the absence of additional context, the sentence structure suggests that \"she\" refers to the subject of the main clause, which is \"the lawyer.\"\n   - There is no indication in the sentence that the cashier has a need to understand the case, as the action of looking into accusations is attributed to the lawyer.\n\n5. **Evaluate for Ambiguity:**\n   - While theoretically, \"she\" could refer to either \"the lawyer\" or \"the cashier,\" the sentence structure and logical flow strongly suggest that \"she\" refers to \"the lawyer.\"\n   - Therefore, the antecedent is not ambiguous based on the given sentence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"she\" is \"the lawyer.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The lawyer needed to understand"
