    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The possible antecedents for \"they\" are \"the developer\" and \"the secretary.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The developer met with the secretary because they made a mistake.\" The pronoun \"they\" follows the conjunction \"because,\" which introduces a reason or cause for the action in the main clause.\n\n4. **Consider Singular vs. Plural**: Both \"the developer\" and \"the secretary\" are singular nouns. The pronoun \"they\" is typically used as a plural pronoun or as a singular gender-neutral pronoun. In this context, \"they\" could be used as a singular gender-neutral pronoun, but it does not provide a clear indication of which singular noun it refers to.\n\n5. **Evaluate Contextual Clarity**: The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to determine whether \"the developer\" or \"the secretary\" made the mistake. Both are equally plausible without further information.\n\n6. **Determine Ambiguity**: Since there is no clear indication or additional context to specify whether \"the developer\" or \"the secretary\" is the antecedent of \"they,\" the pronoun reference is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>>C"
