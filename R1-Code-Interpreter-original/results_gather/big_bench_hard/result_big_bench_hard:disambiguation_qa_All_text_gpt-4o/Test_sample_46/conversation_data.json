    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two entities: \"The lawyer\" and \"the cashier.\" These are the possible antecedents for \"they.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**: \n   - The sentence states, \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because they needed to understand the case.\"\n   - The action of looking into accusations is performed by \"The lawyer.\"\n   - The reason given for this action is \"because they needed to understand the case.\"\n\n4. **Determine Logical Antecedent**:\n   - It is logical to assume that the person who is looking into the accusations (the lawyer) would need to understand the case. This suggests that \"they\" refers to \"The lawyer.\"\n   - There is no indication in the sentence that the cashier is involved in the process of understanding the case. The cashier is the subject of the accusations, not the one investigating or needing to understand the case.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide explicit clarification, but based on the logical flow and typical roles, it is more reasonable to conclude that \"they\" refers to \"The lawyer.\"\n   - There is no strong evidence in the sentence to suggest that \"they\" refers to \"The cashier.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"The lawyer.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The lawyer needed to understand"
