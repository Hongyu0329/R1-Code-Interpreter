    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"The customer and the chef discuss her culinary training,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Antecedent**: The pronoun in question is \"her.\" We need to determine whether \"her\" refers to the customer or the chef.\n\n2. **Examine Sentence Structure**: The sentence structure is \"The customer and the chef discuss her culinary training.\" The pronoun \"her\" is possessive, indicating ownership of \"culinary training.\"\n\n3. **Consider Contextual Clues**: \n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or specific indicators that clearly point to either the customer or the chef as the owner of the culinary training.\n   - In typical scenarios, a chef is more likely to have culinary training than a customer. However, without explicit context, this assumption cannot be definitively made.\n\n4. **Evaluate Ambiguity**: \n   - Since the sentence does not provide clear evidence or context to definitively assign \"her\" to either the customer or the chef, the antecedent of \"her\" is ambiguous.\n   - Both the customer and the chef are equally plausible antecedents without further context.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific context or indicators in the sentence, the antecedent of \"her\" is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
