    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The mechanic disliked the cashier because they are arrogant,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\" It is used to refer to a person or people previously mentioned in the sentence.\n\n2. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the mechanic\" and \"the cashier.\" Therefore, \"they\" could potentially refer to either \"the mechanic\" or \"the cashier.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The mechanic disliked the cashier because they are arrogant.\" The pronoun \"they\" is used in the clause \"because they are arrogant,\" which provides a reason for the mechanic's dislike.\n\n4. **Consider Logical Consistency**: Typically, when a pronoun is used to explain a reason for an action or feeling, it refers to the subject of the action or feeling. In this case, the mechanic's dislike is the action, and the reason given is arrogance. It is more logical to assume that the reason for the mechanic's dislike is the cashier's arrogance, rather than the mechanic's own arrogance.\n\n5. **Evaluate Ambiguity**: While it is grammatically possible for \"they\" to refer to either the mechanic or the cashier, the context of the sentence suggests that the pronoun is more likely referring to the cashier. The sentence implies that the mechanic's dislike is due to the cashier's behavior, not the mechanic's own behavior.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the cashier.\" The sentence implies that the mechanic dislikes the cashier because the cashier is arrogant.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The cashier is arrogant"
