    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The technician told the customer that she had completed the repair,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n\n2. **Identify potential antecedents**: The potential antecedents for \"she\" in this sentence are \"the technician\" and \"the customer.\"\n\n3. **Analyze sentence structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as \"The technician told the customer that she had completed the repair.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The technician told the customer,\" and the subordinate clause is \"that she had completed the repair.\"\n\n4. **Consider typical sentence construction**: \n   - In English, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause, it often refers to the subject of the main clause. However, this is not a strict rule and can vary based on context.\n\n5. **Evaluate context and logic**:\n   - Without additional context, both \"the technician\" and \"the customer\" could logically complete a repair. \n   - The sentence does not provide specific information to definitively link \"she\" to either \"the technician\" or \"the customer.\"\n\n6. **Determine ambiguity**:\n   - Since the sentence does not provide clear context or additional information to determine whether \"she\" refers to \"the technician\" or \"the customer,\" the antecedent of \"she\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pronoun \"she\" could refer to either \"the technician\" or \"the customer,\" and without further context, it is not possible to definitively determine the antecedent.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
