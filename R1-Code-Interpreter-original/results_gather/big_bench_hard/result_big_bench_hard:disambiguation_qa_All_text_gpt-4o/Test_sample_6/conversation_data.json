    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\" It is used as the subject of the clause \"she was too late.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two female entities: \"the investigator\" and \"the witness.\" Either could potentially be the antecedent of \"she.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but she was too late.\" The conjunction \"but\" suggests a contrast or an obstacle related to the investigator's intention to interview the witness.\n\n4. **Consider Logical Flow and Context**: \n   - The investigator's intention is to interview the witness. The phrase \"but she was too late\" implies that something prevented this from happening.\n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the investigator,\" it makes logical sense: the investigator was too late to conduct the interview.\n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the witness,\" it would imply that the witness was too late for something, but the sentence does not provide context for what the witness might be late for, making this interpretation less clear.\n\n5. **Determine Ambiguity**: \n   - The sentence does not provide explicit context to definitively assign \"she\" to either \"the investigator\" or \"the witness.\"\n   - However, the logical flow and typical sentence construction suggest that \"she\" likely refers to \"the investigator,\" as it aligns with the investigator's action and the obstacle presented.\n\n6. **Final Decision**: While the sentence leans towards \"the investigator\" being the antecedent due to logical flow, the lack of explicit context means that it could technically be interpreted as either. Therefore, the pronoun \"she\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
