    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The developer met with the secretary because she made a mistake,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\" It is used as the subject of the clause \"she made a mistake.\"\n\n2. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the developer\" and \"the secretary.\" Either could potentially be the antecedent of \"she.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured with a main clause \"The developer met with the secretary\" and a subordinate clause \"because she made a mistake.\" The subordinate clause provides a reason for the action in the main clause.\n\n4. **Consider Contextual Clues**: In English, when a pronoun is used, it typically refers to the most recently mentioned noun that matches in gender and number. Here, \"the secretary\" is the most recent female noun before \"she.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate Logical Consistency**: The sentence implies a cause-and-effect relationship: the meeting occurred because someone made a mistake. It is more logical to assume that the meeting was prompted by the person who made the mistake, which would be the secretary in this context.\n\n6. **Assess Ambiguity**: While the sentence could technically be interpreted as either person making the mistake, the more straightforward interpretation, given the structure and typical pronoun usage, is that \"she\" refers to \"the secretary.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely antecedent for \"she\" is \"the secretary.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The secretary made a mistake"
