    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n\n2. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two potential antecedents for \"they\":\n   - \"The carpenter\"\n   - \"The onlooker\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The carpenter told the onlooker that they had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n   - The main clause is \"The carpenter told the onlooker.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"that they had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Typically, in English, when a sentence is structured with a reporting verb (e.g., \"told\"), the subject of the main clause is often the implied subject of the subordinate clause unless context suggests otherwise.\n   - In this case, \"The carpenter\" is the subject of the main clause, suggesting that \"they\" likely refers to \"The carpenter.\"\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context to suggest that \"The onlooker\" was involved in working on the house.\n   - Without further context, it is reasonable to assume that \"they\" refers to \"The carpenter,\" as it is more logical for the carpenter to be working on the house rather than the onlooker.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the sentence structure and typical usage, \"they\" most likely refers to \"The carpenter.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" is \"The carpenter.\"\n\n<<<answer>>>A"
