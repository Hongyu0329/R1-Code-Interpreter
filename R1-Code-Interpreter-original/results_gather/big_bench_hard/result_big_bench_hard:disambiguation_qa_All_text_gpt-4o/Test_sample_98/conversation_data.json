    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"The nurse\" and \"the laborer.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure:**\n   - The sentence is: \"The nurse was running from the laborer because she smelled awful.\"\n   - The structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: the nurse's action (running) is caused by something related to \"she.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent:**\n   - Typically, pronouns refer to the nearest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. In this case, \"she\" is feminine, so it could refer to either \"The nurse\" or \"the laborer\" if the laborer is female.\n   - The sentence implies that the nurse is running away due to an unpleasant smell. It is more logical to assume that the nurse is running away because the laborer smells awful, rather than the nurse running away because she herself smells awful.\n\n4. **Consider Contextual Clarity:**\n   - Without additional context, the sentence does not explicitly clarify who \"she\" refers to. However, the logical interpretation based on typical cause-and-effect reasoning is that the laborer is the one who smells awful, prompting the nurse to run away.\n\n5. **Evaluate for Ambiguity:**\n   - While the sentence could technically be interpreted in both ways, the more natural reading is that the laborer is the one who smells awful. However, since the sentence does not provide explicit clarification, it can be considered ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical interpretation is that the laborer is the one who smells awful, but the sentence can be seen as ambiguous due to lack of explicit clarification.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
