    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\" It is used to refer to a female subject in the sentence.\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the developer\" and \"the writer.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"she.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**: The sentence states, \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she focuses on code.\" The use of \"because\" suggests a reason or cause for the developer's inability to communicate with the writer.\n\n4. **Consider Logical Consistency**: \n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the developer,\" the sentence would imply that the developer's focus on code is the reason for the communication issue. This interpretation is possible.\n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the writer,\" the sentence would imply that the writer's focus on code is the reason for the communication issue. This interpretation is also possible.\n\n5. **Determine Ambiguity**: Since both interpretations are logically consistent and the sentence does not provide additional context to clearly favor one over the other, the antecedent of \"she\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
