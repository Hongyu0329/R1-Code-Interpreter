    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\" We need to determine who \"she\" refers to in the sentence.\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The patient was referred to the specialist because she is an expert on rare skin conditions.\"\n\n3. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: There are two possible antecedents for \"she\" in the sentence:\n   - \"The patient\"\n   - \"The specialist\"\n\n4. **Analyze the Context**: The sentence states that \"The patient was referred to the specialist.\" The reason given for this referral is \"because she is an expert on rare skin conditions.\"\n\n5. **Determine Logical Consistency**: \n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the patient,\" the sentence would imply that the patient is an expert on rare skin conditions, which would be an unusual reason for a patient to be referred to a specialist.\n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the specialist,\" the sentence logically explains that the patient was referred to the specialist because the specialist is an expert on rare skin conditions. This is a common and logical reason for a referral.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the logical consistency and typical context of medical referrals, \"she\" most likely refers to \"the specialist.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" is \"the specialist.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The specialist is an expert"
