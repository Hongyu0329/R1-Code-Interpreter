    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The sheriff protected the writer because they uphold the peace,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"they.\" It is used as the subject of the verb \"uphold.\"\n\n2. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two potential antecedents for \"they\": \"the sheriff\" and \"the writer.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured with a main clause \"The sheriff protected the writer\" and a subordinate clause \"because they uphold the peace.\"\n   - The subordinate clause provides a reason for the action in the main clause.\n\n4. **Consider Logical Consistency**:\n   - If \"they\" refers to \"the sheriff,\" the sentence implies that the sheriff protected the writer because the sheriff upholds the peace. This is logically consistent, as it suggests the sheriff's role in maintaining peace is a reason for their protective action.\n   - If \"they\" refers to \"the writer,\" the sentence implies that the sheriff protected the writer because the writer upholds the peace. This is also logically consistent, as it suggests the writer's role in upholding peace is a reason for the sheriff's protective action.\n\n5. **Evaluate Ambiguity**:\n   - Both interpretations are logically plausible, and the sentence does not provide additional context to clearly favor one interpretation over the other.\n   - The pronoun \"they\" is plural, but in modern usage, \"they\" can also be used as a singular pronoun for a person of unspecified gender, which does not help in disambiguating between \"the sheriff\" and \"the writer.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of additional context and the logical consistency of both interpretations, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
