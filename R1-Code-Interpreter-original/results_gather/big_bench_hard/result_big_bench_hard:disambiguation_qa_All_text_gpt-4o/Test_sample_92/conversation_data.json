    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"her,\" which is a possessive pronoun. It is used to indicate ownership of the \"blueprints.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the student\" and \"the architect.\" Either of these could potentially be the owner of the blueprints.\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The student set up a meeting with the architect to review her blueprints.\" The pronoun \"her\" is closer to \"the architect\" in the sentence, which might suggest that the blueprints belong to the architect. However, proximity alone is not a definitive rule for determining antecedents.\n\n4. **Consider Contextual Clues**: \n   - The action of setting up a meeting to review blueprints could imply that the blueprints are related to the architect's work, as architects typically create and review blueprints.\n   - However, it is also possible that the student has blueprints that need to be reviewed by the architect, which would make them the student's blueprints.\n\n5. **Determine Ambiguity**: Without additional context, both interpretations are plausible:\n   - If the student is studying architecture or involved in a project requiring blueprints, they might own the blueprints.\n   - If the meeting is for the architect to present or discuss their own work, the blueprints could belong to the architect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively assign ownership of the blueprints to either the student or the architect, the antecedent of \"her\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
