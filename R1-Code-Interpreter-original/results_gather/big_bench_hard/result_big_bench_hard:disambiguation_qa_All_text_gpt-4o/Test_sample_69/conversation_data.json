    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male entities: \"The patient\" and \"the counselor.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as follows: \"The patient disclosed to the counselor that he had a history of substance abuse.\"\n\n4. **Contextual Clues**: \n   - The phrase \"disclosed to the counselor\" suggests that the patient is sharing personal information with the counselor. \n   - The information being disclosed is \"a history of substance abuse.\" It is more logical and typical for a patient to disclose their own history of substance abuse to a counselor, rather than the counselor disclosing their own history in this context.\n\n5. **Logical Inference**: Based on the typical roles and the context of a counseling session, it is more reasonable to infer that \"he\" refers to \"the patient,\" as it aligns with the common scenario where a patient shares personal issues with a counselor.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the context and typical roles in a counseling scenario, the pronoun \"he\" most likely refers to \"the patient.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is \"The patient.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The patient had a history"
