    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The driver yelled at the tailor after he broke a window,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\" It is used as the subject of the verb \"broke.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is composed of two main parts:\n   - \"The driver yelled at the tailor\" (main clause)\n   - \"after he broke a window\" (subordinate clause)\n\n3. **Determine Possible Antecedents**: The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the driver\" or \"the tailor,\" as both are male and mentioned in the sentence.\n\n4. **Analyze Contextual Clues**: \n   - The sentence does not provide explicit contextual clues to definitively determine who \"he\" refers to.\n   - Both \"the driver\" and \"the tailor\" are equally plausible candidates for having broken the window, as the sentence does not specify any particular action or characteristic that would favor one over the other.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - Since there is no clear indication or additional context provided in the sentence to resolve the ambiguity, the pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the driver\" or \"the tailor.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without additional context or information, the antecedent of \"he\" remains ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
