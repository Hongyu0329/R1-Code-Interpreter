    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\" It is used to refer to a male individual in the sentence.\n\n2. **Identify the Male Nouns**: The sentence contains two male nouns: \"the mechanic\" and \"the receptionist.\" Both are potential antecedents for \"he.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The mechanic greets the receptionist because he is standing in front of the door.\" The use of \"because\" suggests a causal relationship between the action of greeting and the position of \"he\" standing in front of the door.\n\n4. **Determine the Logical Causality**: \n   - If \"he\" refers to \"the mechanic,\" the sentence implies that the mechanic greets the receptionist because the mechanic himself is standing in front of the door. This suggests that the mechanic's position is the reason for the greeting.\n   - If \"he\" refers to \"the receptionist,\" the sentence implies that the mechanic greets the receptionist because the receptionist is standing in front of the door. This suggests that the receptionist's position is the reason for the greeting.\n\n5. **Assess Ambiguity**: \n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to definitively determine which individual is standing in front of the door. \n   - Both interpretations are plausible: the mechanic could greet the receptionist because he (the mechanic) is in a position to do so, or because he (the receptionist) is conveniently located.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without further context, the sentence does not clearly indicate which individual \"he\" refers to. Therefore, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
