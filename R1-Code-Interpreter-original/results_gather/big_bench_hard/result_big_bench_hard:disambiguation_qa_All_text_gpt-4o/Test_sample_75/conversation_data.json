    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"him.\" It is used as an object pronoun, indicating that it is the recipient of the action \"gave.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two male individuals: \"the carpenter\" and \"the clerk.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"him.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as follows: \"The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave him a discount.\"\n   - The main subject of the sentence is \"The carpenter.\"\n   - The action \"made a desk for the clerk\" suggests that the desk is intended for the clerk.\n   - The conjunction \"and\" connects two actions performed by the carpenter: \"made a desk\" and \"gave him a discount.\"\n\n4. **Determine Logical Antecedent**: \n   - Since the carpenter made a desk for the clerk, it is logical to infer that the discount is also intended for the clerk as a continuation of the service provided.\n   - The pronoun \"him\" most likely refers to the clerk, as the carpenter is the one performing the action of giving a discount.\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - The sentence does not explicitly state who receives the discount, but the logical flow and context suggest that the clerk is the recipient.\n   - There is no indication that the carpenter would give himself a discount, as this would not make sense in the context of the sentence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"him\" is \"the clerk.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> B"
