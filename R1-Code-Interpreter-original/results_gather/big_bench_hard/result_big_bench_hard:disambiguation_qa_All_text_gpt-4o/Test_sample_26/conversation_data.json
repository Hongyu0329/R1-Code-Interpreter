    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"him,\" which is an object pronoun. It is used to refer to a male individual who is the recipient of an action.\n\n2. **Identify the Subjects and Objects**: \n   - The sentence has two main subjects: \"The carpenter\" and \"the designer.\"\n   - The action described is \"gave him a prototype.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Action and Its Direction**:\n   - The action \"gave\" involves a giver and a receiver.\n   - The giver in this context is the subject of the sentence, which is \"The carpenter\" (since the sentence starts with \"The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave him a prototype\").\n\n4. **Identify Potential Antecedents**:\n   - The potential antecedents for \"him\" are \"the carpenter\" and \"the designer.\"\n\n5. **Analyze the Context**:\n   - The sentence structure suggests that \"The carpenter\" is the one performing the action of giving.\n   - \"Him\" is the recipient of the prototype.\n   - Since \"The carpenter\" is the subject performing the action, it is logical to infer that \"him\" refers to the other person involved, which is \"the designer.\"\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not explicitly state who \"him\" refers to, but based on typical sentence structure and logical flow, \"him\" is more likely to refer to \"the designer\" rather than \"the carpenter\" himself.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most logical interpretation, given the sentence structure and typical use of pronouns, is that \"him\" refers to \"the designer.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Gave the designer a prototype"
