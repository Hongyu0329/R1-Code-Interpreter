    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam went to his office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Antecedent**: The pronoun in question is \"his.\" We need to determine whose office \"his office\" refers to.\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: \n   - The sentence begins with \"After meeting with the producers,\" which sets the context for the action that follows.\n   - The main clause is \"Sam went to his office.\" Here, \"Sam\" is the subject of the sentence, and \"his\" is the possessive pronoun.\n\n3. **Logical Association**:\n   - In English, possessive pronouns typically refer to the most recent noun or subject that logically fits the context. In this case, \"Sam\" is the subject of the main clause, and it is logical to associate \"his\" with \"Sam\" unless there is a clear indication otherwise.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Options**:\n   - (A) The office was the producers' office: This would imply that \"his\" refers to the producers, but the sentence structure and typical possessive pronoun usage suggest otherwise. The producers are mentioned in a prepositional phrase, not as the main subject.\n   - (B) The office was Sam's office: This is the most straightforward interpretation, as \"his\" logically refers to \"Sam,\" the subject of the main clause.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: For the pronoun to be ambiguous, there would need to be an equally strong case for \"his\" referring to another noun. In this sentence, the structure and typical usage do not support ambiguity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the possessive pronoun \"his\" most logically refers to \"Sam,\" as he is the subject of the main clause and there is no strong competing noun for the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The office was Sam's office"
