    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\" It is used to refer to a female person in the sentence.\n\n2. **Identify the Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"the mechanic\" and \"the receptionist.\" Since \"she\" is a feminine pronoun, it could potentially refer to \"the receptionist,\" as \"mechanic\" is typically a gender-neutral term but often associated with males. However, without additional context, we cannot definitively assign gender based solely on the roles.\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured as \"The mechanic greets the receptionist because she is standing in front of the door.\" The use of \"because\" suggests a causal relationship. The greeting occurs because \"she\" is standing in front of the door.\n\n4. **Consider Logical Context**: In typical scenarios, a receptionist might be expected to be near the entrance or door, as they often manage the front desk or greet visitors. This context supports the idea that \"she\" refers to \"the receptionist.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate Ambiguity**: Despite the logical context, the sentence does not provide explicit information about the gender of the mechanic or the specific location of each person. Therefore, without additional context, it remains possible that \"she\" could refer to either person, making the sentence ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the pronoun \"she\" could logically refer to \"the receptionist,\" but due to the lack of explicit information, it is ultimately ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
