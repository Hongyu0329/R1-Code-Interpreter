    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"they,\" which is used as the subject of the verb \"had purchased.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Sentence Structure**: The sentence is: \"The homeowner asked the inspector if the house they had purchased was structurally sound.\"\n\n3. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two parties: \"The homeowner\" and \"the inspector.\" Either of these could potentially be the antecedent of \"they.\"\n\n4. **Consider Contextual Clues**: \n   - The sentence structure suggests that the homeowner is inquiring about the structural soundness of a house. This implies that the homeowner has a vested interest in the house, which is consistent with the homeowner being the purchaser.\n   - The use of \"they\" as a pronoun is typically plural, but it can also be used as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun. In this context, it is likely used to refer to a singular entity, either the homeowner or the inspector.\n\n5. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**: \n   - The context of the sentence suggests that the homeowner is the one who purchased the house, as they are the ones asking about its structural soundness. This makes it more logical for \"they\" to refer to \"the homeowner.\"\n\n6. **Consider Ambiguity**: \n   - While the sentence could technically be interpreted as either party having purchased the house, the context strongly leans towards the homeowner being the purchaser. Therefore, it is not truly ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the homeowner.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
