    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"Alex tells us that he could not meet,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun**: The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n\n2. **Identify potential antecedents**: The potential antecedents for \"he\" in the sentence are:\n   - \"Alex\"\n   - \"us\" (which refers to \"we\")\n\n3. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured as \"Alex tells us that he could not meet.\"\n   - The main clause is \"Alex tells us,\" and the subordinate clause is \"that he could not meet.\"\n\n4. **Determine the most likely antecedent**:\n   - In English, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause, it often refers to the subject of the main clause unless context suggests otherwise.\n   - Here, \"Alex\" is the subject of the main clause, making it the most likely antecedent for \"he.\"\n\n5. **Consider the options**:\n   - Option (A) suggests \"Alex could not meet,\" which aligns with the analysis that \"he\" refers to \"Alex.\"\n   - Option (B) suggests \"We could not meet,\" which would require \"he\" to refer to \"us,\" but \"us\" is not typically replaced by \"he.\"\n   - Option (C) suggests ambiguity, but given the sentence structure and typical pronoun reference rules, \"he\" most likely refers to \"Alex.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis, the pronoun \"he\" most likely refers to \"Alex,\" making Option (A) the correct choice.\n\n<<<answer>>>A"
