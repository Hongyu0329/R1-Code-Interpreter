    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"she.\" It is used as the subject of the verb \"should avoid.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence contains two potential antecedents for \"she\": \"The worker\" and \"the pedestrian.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as \"The worker told the pedestrian that she should avoid the closed portion of the street.\"\n   - The phrase \"told the pedestrian that\" introduces a subordinate clause \"she should avoid the closed portion of the street.\"\n\n4. **Determine Likely Antecedent**:\n   - In English, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause following a reporting verb (like \"told\"), it often refers to the object of the reporting verb, unless context suggests otherwise.\n   - Here, \"the pedestrian\" is the object of the verb \"told.\"\n\n5. **Consider Contextual Clarity**:\n   - The context of the sentence suggests that the worker is giving advice or instructions to the pedestrian. It is logical that the worker is advising the pedestrian to avoid the closed portion of the street.\n\n6. **Evaluate for Ambiguity**:\n   - There is no explicit indication that \"she\" refers to \"the worker.\" The sentence structure and context lean towards \"the pedestrian\" being the antecedent.\n   - Therefore, the pronoun \"she\" is not ambiguous in this context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely antecedent for \"she\" is \"the pedestrian.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion"
