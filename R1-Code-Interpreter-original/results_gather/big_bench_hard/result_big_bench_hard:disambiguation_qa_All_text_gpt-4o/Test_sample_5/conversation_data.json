    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the developer\" and \"the designer.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**:\n   - The sentence is: \"The developer argued with the designer because she liked the design.\"\n   - The structure is: [Subject 1] argued with [Subject 2] because [Pronoun] liked the design.\n\n3. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - The pronoun \"she\" is typically used to refer to a female subject. Both \"the developer\" and \"the designer\" could potentially be female, so gender does not help us determine the antecedent.\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to definitively link \"she\" to either \"the developer\" or \"the designer.\"\n\n4. **Consider the Context**:\n   - Without additional context, it is unclear whether \"she\" refers to \"the developer\" or \"the designer.\" Both could logically like the design, leading to the argument.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no clear indication or context to determine whether \"she\" refers to \"the developer\" or \"the designer,\" the antecedent of \"she\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
