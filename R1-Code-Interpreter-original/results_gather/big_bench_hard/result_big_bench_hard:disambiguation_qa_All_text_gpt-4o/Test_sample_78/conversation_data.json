    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: The pronoun in question is \"they,\" which is used in the clause \"because they asked.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**: The sentence mentions two people: \"The librarian\" and \"the CEO.\" Both are singular nouns, but \"they\" is a plural pronoun. This discrepancy suggests that \"they\" might not directly refer to either \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO\" individually.\n\n3. **Analyze the Context**: \n   - The sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: \"The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because they asked.\"\n   - The action of asking is the reason for the librarian's help. Typically, the person who receives help (the CEO) would be the one to ask for it, but the use of \"they\" complicates this assumption.\n\n4. **Consider Pronoun Usage**: \n   - In modern English, \"they\" is often used as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun. However, without additional context, it is unclear if \"they\" is being used in this way here.\n   - If \"they\" is intended to be singular and gender-neutral, it could refer to either \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO,\" but the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine which one.\n\n5. **Determine Ambiguity**: \n   - Given the lack of clear context or additional information, the antecedent of \"they\" remains ambiguous. The sentence does not provide enough clues to definitively assign \"they\" to either \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
