    "To determine if the sentence \"Adam Thielen got on base\" is plausible, we need to consider the context and the sports terminology involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Subject**: Adam Thielen is a professional American football player, known for playing as a wide receiver in the NFL. He is not known for playing baseball.\n\n2. **Understanding the Phrase**: The phrase \"got on base\" is a term used in baseball, meaning a player has successfully reached a base, typically first base, as a result of a hit, walk, or other means.\n\n3. **Contextual Plausibility**: Given that Adam Thielen is a football player, the sentence is not plausible in the context of his professional career. However, if the sentence is meant to describe a hypothetical or recreational scenario where Adam Thielen is playing baseball, then it could be plausible.\n\nSince the sentence is likely referring to Adam Thielen in the context of his known profession, it is not plausible for him to \"get on base\" in a professional setting. \n\nTherefore, the sentence is not plausible in the context of Adam Thielen's professional career as a football player.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Adam Thielen got on base\" is not plausible in the context of his professional career as a football player.>>>"
