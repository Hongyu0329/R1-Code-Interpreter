# Let's simulate a search for a basketball player named Mario Gomez
# Since we can't access the internet, we'll simulate the logic of checking a list of known basketball players

# List of known basketball players (simulated)
known_basketball_players = ["LeBron James", "Michael Jordan", "Kobe Bryant", "Stephen Curry", "Kevin Durant"]

# Check if Mario Gomez is in the list
is_basketball_player = "Mario Gomez" in known_basketball_players
