    "To determine if the sentence \"Tuukka Rask killed the powerplay\" is plausible, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence.\n\n1. **Understanding the Terms:**\n   - **Tuukka Rask**: He is a professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Boston Bruins in the NHL.\n   - **Powerplay**: In ice hockey, a powerplay occurs when one team has more players on the ice than the other team due to a penalty. The team with more players is said to be on a powerplay, and they have an advantage to score.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Sentence:**\n   - The phrase \"killed the powerplay\" is often used in hockey to describe a situation where the team that is short-handed (i.e., has fewer players due to a penalty) successfully prevents the opposing team from scoring during the powerplay. This is known as \"killing the penalty\" or \"killing the powerplay.\"\n\n3. **Role of a Goaltender:**\n   - As a goaltender, Tuukka Rask's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring goals. During a powerplay, the goaltender plays a crucial role in stopping shots and helping the team kill the penalty.\n\n4. **Plausibility:**\n   - Given that Tuukka Rask is a goaltender, it is plausible to say that he \"killed the powerplay\" if he made significant saves and contributed to his team successfully defending against the powerplay.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentence is plausible in the context of ice hockey, where Tuukka Rask, as a goaltender, could have played a key role in preventing the opposing team from scoring during a powerplay.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Tuukka Rask killed the powerplay\" is plausible in the context of ice hockey, as it suggests that he played a significant role in preventing the opposing team from scoring during a powerplay.>>>"
