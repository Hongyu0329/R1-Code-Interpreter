    "To determine if the sentence \"Norman Powell committed a blocking foul\" is plausible, we need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Who is Norman Powell?**: Norman Powell is a professional basketball player who has played in the NBA. As a player, he is involved in various aspects of the game, including offense and defense.\n\n2. **What is a blocking foul?**: In basketball, a blocking foul occurs when a defensive player does not establish a legal guarding position in time and makes illegal contact with an offensive player.
