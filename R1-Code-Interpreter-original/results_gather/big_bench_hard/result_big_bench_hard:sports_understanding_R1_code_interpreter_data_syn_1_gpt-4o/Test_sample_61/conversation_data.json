  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Tyler Boyd hit the screen pass in the NFC divisional round\" is plausible, we need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Tyler Boyd's Position and Team**: Tyler Boyd is a professional American football player who plays as a wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals are part of the AFC (American Football Conference), not the NFC (National Football Conference).\n\n2. **Screen Pass**: A screen pass is a type of play in American football where the quarterback throws a short pass to a receiver or running back behind the line of scrimmage, often with blockers in front to help gain yardage.\n\n3. **NFC Divisional Round**: This is a playoff round in the NFC, which is one of the two conferences in the NFL. Since Tyler Boyd plays for an AFC team, he would not participate in the NFC divisional round.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is not plausible because Tyler Boyd, as a member of an AFC team, would not be playing in an NFC divisional round game.\n\n<<<The sentence is not plausible because Tyler Boyd, who plays for an AFC team (Cincinnati Bengals), would not participate in an NFC divisional round game.>>>"
