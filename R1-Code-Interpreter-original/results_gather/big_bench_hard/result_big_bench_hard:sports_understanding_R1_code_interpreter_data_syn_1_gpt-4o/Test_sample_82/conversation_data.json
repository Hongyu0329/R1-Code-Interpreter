    "To determine if the sentence \"Drew Brees was flagged on the play\" is plausible, we need to consider the context of American football, where the term \"flagged\" is used. In football, a player can be \"flagged\" for committing a penalty, which means a referee throws a penalty flag to indicate an infraction.\n\nDrew Brees is a well-known former professional American football quarterback who played in the NFL, primarily for the New Orleans Saints. As a quarterback, Brees would not typically be the player committing penalties that result in being \"flagged.\" Most penalties are committed by offensive or defensive linemen, receivers, or defensive backs. However, quarterbacks can be flagged for certain infractions, such as intentional grounding or unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nGiven this context, while it is less common for a quarterback like Drew Brees to be flagged, it is still plausible. Therefore, the sentence is plausible, albeit not typical.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Drew Brees was flagged on the play\" is plausible, as quarterbacks can be flagged for certain infractions, though it is less common.>>>"
