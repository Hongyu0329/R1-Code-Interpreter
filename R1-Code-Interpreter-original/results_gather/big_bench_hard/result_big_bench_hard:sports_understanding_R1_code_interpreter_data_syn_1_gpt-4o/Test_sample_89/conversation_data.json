    "To determine if the sentence \"Dejounte Murray took a side-step three\" is plausible, we need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Understanding the Terminology**: \n   - \"Side-step three\" refers to a basketball move where a player takes a lateral step to create space from a defender before shooting a three-point shot. This is a common move in basketball, especially among guards and forwards who are adept at shooting from long range.\n\n2. **Player Profile**:\n   - Dejounte Murray is a professional basketball player known for his skills as a guard. He has played in the NBA and is recognized for his defensive abilities, playmaking, and scoring. While he is not primarily known as a three-point specialist, he is capable of making three-point shots.\n\n3. **Plausibility**:\n   - Given that Dejounte Murray is a guard and has the skills to perform various offensive moves, it is plausible that he could execute a side-step three-point shot during a game. Guards often use such moves to create space and take advantage of scoring opportunities.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the sentence is plausible. Dejounte Murray, being a skilled guard, could indeed perform a side-step three-point shot in a basketball game.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes, the sentence \"Dejounte Murray took a side-step three\" is plausible.<<<answer>>>"
