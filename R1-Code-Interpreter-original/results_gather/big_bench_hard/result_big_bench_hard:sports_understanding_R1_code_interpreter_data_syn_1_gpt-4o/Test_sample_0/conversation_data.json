  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Elias Lindholm beat the buzzer\" is plausible, we need to consider the context in which this phrase is typically used and who Elias Lindholm is.\n\n1. **Understanding the Phrase \"Beat the Buzzer\":**\n   - The phrase \"beat the buzzer\" is commonly used in sports, particularly in basketball and sometimes in hockey, to describe a situation where a player makes a successful play (like scoring a basket or a goal) just before the game or period time expires.\n\n2. **Who is Elias Lindholm?**\n   - Elias Lindholm is a professional ice hockey player from Sweden. He plays in the National Hockey League (NHL) and is known for his skills on the ice.\n\n3. **Contextual Plausibility:**\n   - Given that Elias Lindholm is a hockey player, the phrase \"beat the buzzer\" could plausibly apply to him if he scored a goal just before the end of a period or game. This is a common scenario in hockey where players aim to score before the period ends.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the sentence \"Elias Lindholm beat the buzzer\" is plausible within the context of a hockey game where he scores a goal just before the time expires.\n\n<<<Yes, the sentence \"Elias Lindholm beat the buzzer\" is plausible, especially in the context of a hockey game.>>>"
