  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Gleyber Torres got a base hit\" is plausible, we need to consider the context and the subject involved. Gleyber Torres is a professional baseball player, known for playing in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. A \"base hit\" is a common term in baseball, referring to a successful hit by a batter that allows them to reach at least first base safely.\n\nGiven that Gleyber Torres is a professional baseball player, it is entirely plausible for him to get a base hit during a game. This is a routine event in baseball, and as a player, Torres would have numerous opportunities to achieve this during his career.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible based on the context of baseball and the known capabilities of Gleyber Torres as a player.\n\n<<<Yes, the sentence \"Gleyber Torres got a base hit\" is plausible.>>>"
