  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Courtland Sutton hit a triple\" is plausible, we need to consider the context and the sports involved. \n\n1. **Identify Courtland Sutton**: Courtland Sutton is a professional American football player who plays as a wide receiver for the Denver Broncos in the NFL.\n\n2. **Understand the term \"hit a triple\"**: The phrase \"hit a triple\" is commonly used in baseball. It refers to a batter hitting the ball and reaching third base safely in one play.\n\n3. **Cross-reference sports**: Since Courtland Sutton is a football player and \"hit a triple\" is a baseball term, the sentence seems to mix two different sports contexts.\n\n4. **Plausibility check**: For the sentence to be plausible, Courtland Sutton would need to be participating in a baseball game, which is not his professional sport. While it's not impossible for athletes to play multiple sports, it is not common for a professional football player to be recognized for a baseball achievement unless they have a known history or career in baseball as well.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is not plausible in the context of Courtland Sutton's known professional career. \n\n<<<The sentence \"Courtland Sutton hit a triple\" is not plausible because Courtland Sutton is a professional football player, and \"hit a triple\" is a term used in baseball.>>>"
