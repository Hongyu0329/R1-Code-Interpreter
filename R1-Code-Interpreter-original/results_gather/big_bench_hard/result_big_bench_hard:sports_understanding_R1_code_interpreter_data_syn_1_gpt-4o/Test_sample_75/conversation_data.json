  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Gerrit Cole committed a handball in the European Cup\" is plausible, we need to analyze the components of the sentence:\n\n1. **Gerrit Cole**: Gerrit Cole is a professional baseball pitcher who plays in Major League Baseball (MLB). He is not known for playing soccer or any other sport professionally.\n\n2. **Handball**: In the context of sports, a handball is an infraction in soccer (football) where a player illegally touches the ball with their hand or arm. It is also a separate sport, but the context here suggests the soccer infraction.\n\n3. **European Cup**: This term typically refers to a major soccer tournament in Europe, such as the UEFA European Championship or the UEFA Champions League.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is implausible because:\n\n- Gerrit Cole is a baseball player, not a soccer player.\n- The European Cup is a soccer tournament, and it is unlikely for a baseball player to participate in it, let alone commit a handball.\n\nTherefore, the sentence does not make sense in the context of known facts about Gerrit Cole and the European Cup.\n\n<<<The sentence is implausible because Gerrit Cole is a baseball player, not a soccer player, and the European Cup is a soccer tournament.>>>"
