    "To determine if the sentence \"Igor Shesterkin launched a hail mary\" is plausible, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the terms involved:\n\n1. **Igor Shesterkin**: He is a professional ice hockey goaltender who plays for the New York Rangers in the NHL. As a goaltender, his primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring by blocking shots on goal.\n\n2. **Hail Mary**: This term is commonly used in American football to describe a long, desperate pass thrown by the quarterback, usually at the end of a game, in an attempt to score a touchdown. It is characterized by its low probability of success and is often used as a last resort.\n\nGiven these definitions, we need to consider the plausibility of a goaltender in ice hockey \"launching a hail mary.\" In ice hockey, goaltenders do not typically make long passes or shots, especially not in the same manner as a \"hail mary\" in football. However, there are rare instances where a goaltender might attempt a long shot towards the opposing goal, especially if the opposing net is empty, but this is not commonly referred to as a \"hail mary.\"\n\nTherefore, while the sentence is not entirely implausible, it is unusual and not a typical description of an action in ice hockey. The term \"hail mary\" is not commonly used in the context of ice hockey, especially concerning a goaltender's actions.\n\n<<<The sentence is not entirely plausible as it mixes terminology from different sports. In ice hockey, a goaltender like Igor Shesterkin would not typically \"launch a hail mary,\" as this term is specific to American football.>>>"
