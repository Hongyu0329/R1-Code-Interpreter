    "To determine if the sentence \"Fernando Tatis Jr. earned a red card\" is plausible, we need to consider the context of the sports involved. \n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: \n   - Fernando Tatis Jr. is a professional baseball player, known for playing in Major League Baseball (MLB).\n   - A \"red card\" is a term used in soccer (football) to indicate a player has been sent off the field for a serious offense.\n\n2. **Cross-Sport Terminology**:\n   - In baseball, there is no concept of a \"red card.\" Instead, players can be ejected from a game by an umpire for misconduct, but this is not referred to as a \"red card.\"\n   - Therefore, the sentence is not plausible in the context of baseball.\n\n3. **Possibility of Multi-Sport Involvement**:\n   - If Fernando Tatis Jr. were to play soccer, then earning a red card would be plausible. However, there is no known record of him playing professional soccer.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the sentence is not plausible given the current known facts about Fernando Tatis Jr. and the sports terminology involved.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Fernando Tatis Jr. earned a red card\" is not plausible because Fernando Tatis Jr. is a baseball player, and the concept of a \"red card\" is not applicable in baseball.>>>"
