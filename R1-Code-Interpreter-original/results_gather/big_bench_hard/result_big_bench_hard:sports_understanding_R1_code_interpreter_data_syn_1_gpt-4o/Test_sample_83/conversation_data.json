    "To determine if the sentence \"Ramires scored a header goal\" is plausible, we need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Who is Ramires?**: Ramires is a Brazilian professional footballer known for his time at clubs like Chelsea and Benfica, as well as the Brazilian national team. He is a midfielder known for his energy, versatility, and ability to contribute both defensively and offensively.\n\n2. **Header Goals in Football**: A header goal is when a player scores by hitting the ball with their head. This is a common way to score in football, especially for players who are good at positioning and timing during set-pieces like corners or free-kicks.\n\n3. **Ramires' Playing Style**: Ramires, while not primarily known for his heading ability, has scored goals using his head during his career. His playing style includes making late runs into the box, which can lead to opportunities for header goals.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is plausible for Ramires to have scored a header goal during his career. There is no inherent contradiction or improbability in the sentence.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes, the sentence \"Ramires scored a header goal\" is plausible.<<<answer>>>"
