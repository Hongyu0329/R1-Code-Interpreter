    "To determine if the sentence \"Marouane Fellaini scored in extra time\" is plausible, we need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Player's History**: Marouane Fellaini is a professional footballer known for his time at clubs like Manchester United and Everton, as well as the Belgian national team. He has been known to score goals, particularly with his head due to his height and physical presence.\n\n2. **Extra Time Scenarios**: Extra time is a common occurrence in football matches, especially in knockout stages of tournaments or cup competitions. It is plausible for any player, including Fellaini, to score during this period.\n\n3. **Historical Matches**: We can check historical match data to see if there are instances where Fellaini has scored in extra time. This would provide concrete evidence of the plausibility.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is plausible if:\n- Fellaini has played in matches that went to extra time.\n- He has scored in such matches.\n\nTo verify this, we can search for historical match data involving Marouane Fellaini and check if there are records of him scoring in extra time. However, without access to a specific database or historical match records in this environment, we can only rely on general knowledge and logical reasoning.\n\nBased on general knowledge, it is plausible for Marouane Fellaini to have scored in extra time, given his role and history as a footballer. However, without specific match data, we cannot confirm a specific instance.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible based on the general context of football and Fellaini's career.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Marouane Fellaini scored in extra time\" is plausible based on his career as a professional footballer and the nature of football matches.>>>"
