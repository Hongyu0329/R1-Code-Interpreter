    "To determine if the sentence \"Philip Rivers launched a hail mary\" is plausible, we need to consider the context and meaning of the terms involved:\n\n1. **Philip Rivers**: He is a former professional American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons, primarily with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers. He is known for his strong arm and ability to make deep throws.\n\n2. **Hail Mary**: In American football, a \"Hail Mary\" is a long forward pass, typically made in desperation, with only a small chance of success. It is usually thrown at the end of a half or game when the team is far from the end zone and needs a touchdown to win or tie the game.\n\nGiven these definitions, the sentence is plausible if Philip Rivers, known for his quarterback skills, attempted a long, desperate pass during a game. This is a common scenario in football, especially for a quarterback like Rivers who has the capability to throw long passes.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible as it describes a situation that could realistically occur in a football game involving Philip Rivers.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Philip Rivers launched a hail mary\" is plausible.>>>"
