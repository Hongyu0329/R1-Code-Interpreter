    "To determine if the sentence \"Luis Robert was out at second\" is plausible, we need to consider the context in which this sentence might occur. The sentence appears to be related to a baseball game, where a player named Luis Robert was tagged out or forced out at second base.\n\nIn baseball, a player can be out at second base in several scenarios, such as:\n\n1. **Force Out**: If a runner is forced to advance to the next base because the batter becomes a runner, and the defense gets the ball to second base before the runner arrives, the runner is out.\n\n2. **Tag Out**: If a runner is attempting to steal second base or advance on a hit, and the defense tags the runner with the ball before they reach the base, the runner is out.\n\n3. **Caught Stealing**: If a runner attempts to steal second base and is thrown out by the catcher or another fielder, the runner is out.\n\n4. **Double Play**: If a batter hits a ground ball and the defense turns a double play, the runner at first base can be out at second.\n\nGiven these scenarios, the sentence \"Luis Robert was out at second\" is indeed plausible within the context of a baseball game. It describes a common event where a player is put out while attempting to reach or occupy second base.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible.\n\n<<<Yes, the sentence \"Luis Robert was out at second\" is plausible within the context of a baseball game.>>>"
