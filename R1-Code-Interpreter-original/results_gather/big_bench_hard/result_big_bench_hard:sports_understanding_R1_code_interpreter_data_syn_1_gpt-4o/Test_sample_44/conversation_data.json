    "To determine if the sentence \"Santi Cazorla called for the screen\" is plausible, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the words used in the sentence.\n\n1. **Understanding the Subject**: Santi Cazorla is a well-known Spanish professional footballer. He is primarily known for his skills on the soccer field.\n\n2. **Understanding the Action**: The phrase \"called for the screen\" is commonly used in basketball. In basketball, a \"screen\" is a blocking move by an offensive player to free a teammate to receive a pass or take a shot.\n\n3. **Contextual Plausibility**: \n   - In football (soccer), the term \"screen\" is not typically used in the same way as in basketball. Soccer players do not \"call for a screen\" in the same manner.\n   - However, if Santi Cazorla were in a different context, such as playing basketball or involved in a situation where a screen (like a video screen or a computer screen) is relevant, the sentence could be plausible.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that Santi Cazorla is primarily associated with soccer, the sentence seems implausible in the context of his known profession. However, without additional context, such as him participating in a basketball game or another scenario involving a screen, the sentence could be plausible.\n\nTherefore, the plausibility of the sentence depends on the context in which it is used. Without additional context, it seems unlikely given Santi Cazorla's known background.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Santi Cazorla called for the screen\" is implausible in the context of soccer, which is Santi Cazorla's known profession. However, it could be plausible in a different context, such as basketball or another scenario involving a screen.>>>"
