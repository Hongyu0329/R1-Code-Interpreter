    "To determine if the sentence \"Brandin Cooks went for it on fourth down\" is plausible, we need to consider the context of American football, where the phrase \"went for it on fourth down\" is commonly used. In football, a team has four downs (or attempts) to advance the ball 10 yards. If they fail to do so by the fourth down, they typically have three options: punt the ball, attempt a field goal, or \"go for it\" by trying to gain the necessary yards to continue their drive.\n\nBrandin Cooks is a professional football player, specifically a wide receiver. Wide receivers are typically involved in catching passes from the quarterback, and they are not usually the ones making the decision to \"go for it\" on fourth down. That decision is typically made by the team's coach or the quarterback, depending on the situation.\n\nHowever, the sentence could be plausible if interpreted as Brandin Cooks being involved in a play on fourth down where the team decided to \"go for it.\" For example, if the team decided to attempt a pass play on fourth down, Brandin Cooks could be the receiver targeted for the pass. In this context, the sentence could be seen as plausible, albeit slightly misleading in terms of who actually makes the decision to \"go for it.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is plausible if interpreted as Brandin Cooks being part of a play on fourth down, but not if interpreted as him making the decision to go for it.\n\n<<<The sentence is plausible if interpreted as Brandin Cooks being involved in a play on fourth down, but not if interpreted as him making the decision to go for it.>>>"
