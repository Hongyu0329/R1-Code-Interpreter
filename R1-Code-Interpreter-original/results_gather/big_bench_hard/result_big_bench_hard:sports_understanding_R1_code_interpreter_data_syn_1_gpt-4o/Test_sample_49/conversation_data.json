  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Robert Lewandowski threw a touchdown\" is plausible, we need to analyze the context and the roles involved:\n\n1. **Robert Lewandowski**: He is a well-known professional soccer player, primarily recognized for his role as a striker. He has played for clubs like Bayern Munich and FC Barcelona, and he is also a key player for the Polish national team.\n\n2. **Touchdown**: This term is associated with American football, not soccer. A touchdown is scored when a player carries the ball into the opposing team's end zone or catches the ball while in the end zone.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is not plausible because Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player, and the action of throwing a touchdown is specific to American football. Therefore, it is unlikely for him to be involved in such an action within the context of his professional career.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Robert Lewandowski threw a touchdown\" is not plausible because Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player, and a touchdown is a term from American football.>>>"
