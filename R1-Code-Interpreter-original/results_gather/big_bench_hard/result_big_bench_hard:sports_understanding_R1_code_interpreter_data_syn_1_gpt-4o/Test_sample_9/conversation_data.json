    "To determine if the sentence \"Robin Lehner launched the desperation heave\" is plausible, we need to analyze the components of the sentence:\n\n1. **Robin Lehner**: He is a professional ice hockey goaltender. As a goaltender, his primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring by blocking shots on goal.\n\n2. **Desperation heave**: This term is commonly used in sports, particularly in basketball and sometimes in football, to describe a last-second, long-distance shot or throw made in a desperate attempt to score. It is not typically associated with ice hockey, especially not with a goaltender.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence seems implausible in the context of ice hockey and Robin Lehner's role as a goaltender. A goaltender would not typically be involved in making a \"desperation heave\" as it is not a common action in ice hockey, especially for someone in his position.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is not plausible in the context of Robin Lehner's professional role and the typical use of the term \"desperation heave.\"\n\n<<<The sentence \"Robin Lehner launched the desperation heave\" is not plausible, as it does not align with Robin Lehner's role as a goaltender in ice hockey and the typical use of the term \"desperation heave\" in sports.>>>"
