  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Evander Kane hit the slant pass in the AFC divisional round\" is plausible, we need to analyze the components of the sentence:\n\n1. **Evander Kane**: He is a professional ice hockey player, known for playing in the NHL. He is not associated with American football.\n\n2. **Slant pass**: This is a term used in American football, referring to a type of pass play where the receiver runs a slant route.\n\n3. **AFC divisional round**: This is a part of the NFL playoffs, specifically referring to the American Football Conference's divisional playoff games.\n\nGiven these components, the sentence is not plausible because Evander Kane is an ice hockey player and not involved in American football. Therefore, he would not be participating in an NFL game or executing a slant pass in the AFC divisional round.\n\n<<<answer The sentence is not plausible because Evander Kane is an ice hockey player, not a football player, and would not be involved in the AFC divisional round.>>>"
