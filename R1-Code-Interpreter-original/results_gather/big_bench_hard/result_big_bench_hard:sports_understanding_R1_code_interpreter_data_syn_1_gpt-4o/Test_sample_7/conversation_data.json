  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Bryce Harper hit the back shoulder fade\" is plausible, we need to analyze the context and terminology used in the sentence.\n\n1. **Bryce Harper**: He is a professional baseball player known for his skills as a hitter. He plays in Major League Baseball (MLB).\n\n2. **Back Shoulder Fade**: This term is typically associated with American football, not baseball. In football, a \"back shoulder fade\" is a type of pass where the quarterback throws the ball to the receiver's back shoulder, away from the defender. It is a strategic play used to create separation between the receiver and the defender.\n\n3. **Baseball Terminology**: In baseball, terms like \"hit,\" \"home run,\" \"single,\" \"double,\" \"triple,\" etc., are used to describe actions related to batting. There is no known baseball term called \"back shoulder fade.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is not plausible because it mixes terminology from two different sports. Bryce Harper, being a baseball player, would not be associated with executing a \"back shoulder fade,\" which is a football play.\n\n<<<The sentence is not plausible because it mixes baseball and football terminology. Bryce Harper, a baseball player, would not be associated with a \"back shoulder fade,\" which is a football term.>>>"
