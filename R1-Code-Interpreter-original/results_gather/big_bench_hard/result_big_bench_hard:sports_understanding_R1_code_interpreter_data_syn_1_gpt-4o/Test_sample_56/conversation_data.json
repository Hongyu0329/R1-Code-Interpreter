    "To determine if the sentence \"Kawhi Leonard took a turnaround jumper\" is plausible, we need to consider the context of Kawhi Leonard's playing style and the nature of a turnaround jumper in basketball.\n\n1. **Understanding Kawhi Leonard's Playing Style:**\n   - Kawhi Leonard is a professional basketball player known for his scoring ability, defensive skills, and versatility on the court.\n   - He is known for his mid-range shooting, post-up game, and ability to create his own shot.\n   - A turnaround jumper is a common move for players who are skilled in the post or mid-range areas, allowing them to create space from a defender and take a shot.\n\n2. **Understanding a Turnaround Jumper:**\n   - A turnaround jumper is a basketball shot where the player, often with their back to the basket, pivots on one foot and turns around to face the basket before taking a jump shot.\n   - This move is typically used by players who are adept at playing with their back to the basket and have a good shooting touch.\n\nGiven Kawhi Leonard's skill set and playing style, it is plausible that he would take a turnaround jumper during a game.
