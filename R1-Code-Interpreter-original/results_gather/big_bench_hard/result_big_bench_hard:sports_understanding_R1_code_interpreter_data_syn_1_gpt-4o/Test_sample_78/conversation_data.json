    "To determine if the sentence \"Nazem Kadri was out at home\" is plausible, we need to consider the context in which it might be used. Nazem Kadri is a professional ice hockey player, so the sentence could be interpreted in a sports context, particularly in baseball terminology.\n\nIn baseball, the phrase \"out at home\" refers to a player being tagged out while trying to score a run at home plate. However, since Nazem Kadri is a hockey player, not a baseball player, the sentence might not be directly applicable in a literal sports context.\n\nAlternatively, the sentence could be interpreted in a more general sense, where \"out at home\" simply means that Nazem Kadri was not at home, or he was outside his home. This interpretation is plausible in everyday language.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is plausible if interpreted in a general context, but it might not be directly applicable in a sports context related to Nazem Kadri's profession.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Nazem Kadri was out at home\" is plausible if interpreted in a general context, meaning he was not at home. However, it is not directly applicable in a sports context related to his profession as an ice hockey player.>>>"
