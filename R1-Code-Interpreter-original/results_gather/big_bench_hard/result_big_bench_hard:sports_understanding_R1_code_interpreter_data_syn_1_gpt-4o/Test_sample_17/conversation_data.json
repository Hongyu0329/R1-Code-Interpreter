    "To determine if the sentence \"Adam Thielen scored in added time\" is plausible, we need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Who is Adam Thielen?**  \n   Adam Thielen is a professional American football player who has played as a wide receiver in the NFL, primarily known for his time with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n2. **What is \"added time\"?**  \n   \"Added time\" is a term commonly used in soccer (football) to refer to the extra time added at the end of a match to compensate for stoppages in play. In American football, the equivalent concept is \"overtime,\" which occurs if the game is tied at the end of regulation time.\n\n3. **Contextual Plausibility:**  \n   The sentence would be plausible if it were referring to a soccer match, but since Adam Thielen is an American football player, the term \"added time\" is not typically used in that context. Instead, if the sentence were referring to an American football game, it would be more appropriate to say \"Adam Thielen scored in overtime.\"\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is not plausible in the context of American football due to the use of the term \"added time.\" However, if it were a hypothetical scenario where Adam Thielen was playing soccer, it could be plausible.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Adam Thielen scored in added time\" is not plausible in the context of American football, as \"added time\" is a term used in soccer, not in American football. In American football, the equivalent term would be \"overtime.\" Therefore, the sentence is not plausible unless it is a hypothetical scenario where Adam Thielen is playing soccer.>>>"
