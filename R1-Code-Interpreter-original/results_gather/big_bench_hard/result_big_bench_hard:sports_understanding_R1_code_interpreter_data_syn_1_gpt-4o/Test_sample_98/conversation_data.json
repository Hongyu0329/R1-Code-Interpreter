    "To determine if the sentence \"Ben Simmons was called for the goal tend\" is plausible, we need to understand the context of basketball rules and Ben Simmons' role in the sport.\n\n1. **Understanding Goal Tending in Basketball**: \n   - Goal tending is a violation in basketball that occurs when a player illegally interferes with the ball on its way to the basket. This can happen if a player touches the ball when it is above the rim and on its downward path to the basket, or if a player touches the ball after it has hit the backboard and is above the rim.\n\n2. **Ben Simmons' Role**:\n   - Ben Simmons is a professional basketball player known for his versatility on the court. He plays as a guard/forward and is known for his defensive skills, among other attributes.\n\n3. **Plausibility Check**:\n   - Since Ben Simmons is a professional basketball player, it is entirely plausible for him to be involved in a play where goal tending could be called. Goal tending can be called on any player who commits the violation, regardless of their position or reputation.\n\nGiven this understanding, the sentence is plausible because it describes a situation that could realistically occur in a basketball game involving Ben Simmons.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Ben Simmons was called for the goal tend\" is plausible.>>>"
