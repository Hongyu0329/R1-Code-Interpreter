    "To determine if the sentence \"Gerard Pique scored a corner kick\" is plausible, we need to understand the context of soccer (football) and the roles of players during a match.\n\n1. **Understanding Corner Kicks**: In soccer, a corner kick is awarded when the ball goes out of play over the goal line, last touched by a player from the defending team. The attacking team then takes a corner kick from the corner arc nearest to where the ball went out of play. The objective is to deliver the ball into the penalty area to create a scoring opportunity.\n\n2. **Scoring from a Corner Kick**: It is extremely rare for a player to score directly from a corner kick. This is known as an \"Olympic goal\" or \"gol ol√≠mpico.\" While it is possible, it requires exceptional skill and precision.\n\n3. **Gerard Pique's Role**: Gerard Pique is a professional footballer known for his defensive skills as a center-back. While he is known for scoring goals, especially from set-pieces like corners due to his height and heading ability, he typically does not take corner kicks. Instead, he would be in the penalty area trying to score from a header or a rebound.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence \"Gerard Pique scored a corner kick\" is implausible because:\n- Pique, being a defender, would not typically take a corner kick.\n- Scoring directly from a corner kick is rare and not a common occurrence for any player, let alone a defender like Pique.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is not plausible in the context of a typical soccer match.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Gerard Pique scored a corner kick\" is implausible.>>>"
