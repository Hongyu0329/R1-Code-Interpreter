  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Giorgio Chiellini committed a handball in the FA Cup\" is plausible, we need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Player's Career**: Giorgio Chiellini is an Italian professional footballer known for playing as a defender. He has spent the majority of his career at Juventus, an Italian club, and has also been a part of the Italian national team.\n\n2. **FA Cup**: The FA Cup is a domestic football competition in England. It involves clubs from various levels of the English football league system.\n\n3. **Player's Participation in the FA Cup**: For Chiellini to commit a handball in the FA Cup, he would need to be playing for an English club participating in the competition. As of the latest information, Chiellini has not played for any English club that would participate in the FA Cup.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence seems implausible because Chiellini has not been known to play in the FA Cup, as he has not been part of an English club that participates in this competition.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Giorgio Chiellini committed a handball in the FA Cup\" is implausible because Chiellini has not played for an English club that participates in the FA Cup.>>>"
