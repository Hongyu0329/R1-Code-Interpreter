    "To determine if the sentence \"Joao Moutinho was out at third\" is plausible, we need to analyze the context and the entities involved.\n\n1. **Joao Moutinho**: Joao Moutinho is a professional soccer player from Portugal. He is known for his career in football (soccer) and has played for clubs like AS Monaco, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and the Portuguese national team.\n\n2. **\"Out at third\"**: This phrase is typically associated with baseball, not soccer. In baseball, \"out at third\" refers to a player being tagged out or forced out at third base.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence seems to mix contexts from two different sports: soccer and baseball. Joao Moutinho is a soccer player, and the phrase \"out at third\" is a baseball term. Therefore, the sentence is not plausible in a literal sense because it combines elements from two unrelated sports.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Joao Moutinho was out at third\" is not plausible because it mixes soccer and baseball contexts. Joao Moutinho is a soccer player, and \"out at third\" is a baseball term.>>>"
