    "To determine if the sentence \"Josh Allen hit the screen pass\" is plausible, we need to understand the context and terminology used in American football.\n\n1. **Understanding the Terms:**\n   - **Josh Allen:** He is a well-known quarterback in the NFL, playing for the Buffalo Bills.\n   - **Screen Pass:** This is a type of pass in American football where the quarterback throws a short pass to a receiver, typically a running back or wide receiver, who is positioned behind the line of scrimmage. The offensive linemen move downfield to block for the receiver.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Sentence:**\n   - The phrase \"hit the screen pass\" is not a standard way to describe a quarterback's action. Typically, a quarterback \"throws\" or \"completes\" a screen pass. The term \"hit\" is more commonly used to describe a successful pass completion, as in \"hit the receiver with a pass.\"\n\n3. **Plausibility:**\n   - While the sentence is not phrased in the most conventional way, it is still plausible if interpreted as Josh Allen successfully executing a screen pass. The use of \"hit\" could be understood as him successfully completing the pass to the intended receiver.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is plausible in the context of American football, though it might not be the most conventional phrasing.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Josh Allen hit the screen pass\" is plausible, though not the most conventional phrasing. It can be understood as Josh Allen successfully executing a screen pass.>>>"
