    "To determine if the sentence \"Jordan Binnington scored in the third period\" is plausible, we need to consider the context of who Jordan Binnington is and the typical roles in ice hockey.\n\n1. **Identify Jordan Binnington**: Jordan Binnington is a professional ice hockey goaltender who plays for the St. Louis Blues in the NHL. As a goaltender, his primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring by blocking shots on goal.\n\n2. **Scoring in Ice Hockey**: In ice hockey, scoring is typically done by forwards and defensemen. Goaltenders rarely score goals because they are primarily focused on defending their own net. However, it is not impossible for a goaltender to score. There have been instances in NHL history where goaltenders have scored goals, usually by shooting the puck into an empty net when the opposing team has pulled their goalie for an extra attacker.\n\n3. **Plausibility of the Sentence**: While it is uncommon, it is not impossible for a goaltender like Jordan Binnington to score a goal. Therefore, the sentence is plausible, but it would be considered a rare event in a hockey game.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the sentence is plausible, albeit unlikely in a typical game scenario.\n\n<<<The sentence \"Jordan Binnington scored in the third period\" is plausible, but it would be a rare occurrence since he is a goaltender.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Is the following sentence plausible? \"Jordan Binnington scored in the third period.\"\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
