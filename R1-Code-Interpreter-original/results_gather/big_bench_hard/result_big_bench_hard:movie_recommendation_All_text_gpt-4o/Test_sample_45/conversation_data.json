It combines elements of action, suspense, and drama.\n\n2. **The Shawshank Redemption (1994)**: This is a drama film about hope, friendship, and redemption, set in a prison. It focuses on the human spirit and the bonds formed between inmates.\n\n3. **Beauty and the Beast (1991)**: This is an animated musical romantic fantasy film.

It doesn't align with the serious and dramatic themes of the listed films.\n\n(D) **Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning (2012)**: This is an action film with science fiction elements.
