    "To find a movie similar to Batman, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, and Forrest Gump, we need to analyze the characteristics and genres of these movies:\n\n1. **Batman**: This is a superhero film, often characterized by action, adventure, and sometimes a darker tone. It involves a protagonist with a strong moral code and often features a battle between good and evil.\n\n2. **Independence Day**: This is a science fiction action film. It involves an alien invasion and features large-scale action sequences, special effects, and a theme of humanity uniting against a common threat.\n\n3. **Jurassic Park**: This is a science fiction adventure film. It involves dinosaurs brought back to life through genetic engineering, with themes of survival, adventure, and the consequences of playing with nature.\n\n4. **Forrest Gump**: This is a drama with elements of romance and comedy. It follows the life of a man with a low IQ who witnesses and unwittingly influences several historical events in the 20th century United States.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **Pleasantville**: This is a fantasy comedy-drama film. It involves two teenagers transported into a 1950s TV show, where they bring changes to the black-and-white world. It has elements of fantasy and drama, but it doesn't align closely with the action or adventure themes of the original movies.\n\n(B) **The Mask**: This is a superhero comedy film. It involves a man who finds a magical mask that transforms him into a zany, cartoonish superhero. It shares the superhero element with Batman and has a comedic tone, which aligns with some aspects of Forrest Gump.\n\n(C) **To Catch a Thief**: This is a romantic thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It involves a retired cat burglar who must catch a thief to prove his innocence. It doesn't align closely with the action, adventure, or science fiction elements of the original movies.\n\n(D) **Microwave Massacre**: This is a comedy horror film. It involves a man who becomes a cannibal after accidentally killing his wife. It doesn't align with the themes or genres of the original movies.\n\nBased on the analysis, **The Mask** (Option B) is the most similar to the original movies, particularly Batman, due to its superhero theme, and it also shares a comedic element with Forrest Gump.\n\n<<<B>>>"
