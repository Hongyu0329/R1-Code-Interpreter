    "To find a movie similar to the ones listed (American Beauty, Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope, Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Forrest Gump), we need to consider the genres, themes, and styles of these films:\n\n1. **American Beauty**: This film is a drama that explores themes of suburban life, midlife crisis, and the pursuit of happiness. It has a strong focus on character development and social commentary.\n\n2. **Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope & Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back**: These are iconic science fiction films with elements of adventure, fantasy, and space opera. They focus on the battle between good and evil, with a strong emphasis on character arcs and epic storytelling.\n\n3. **Forrest Gump**: This is a drama with elements of romance and comedy. It tells the life story of a man with a low IQ who witnesses and unwittingly influences several historical events in the 20th century United States.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **Cargo**: This is a post-apocalyptic thriller film, which doesn't align well with the themes or genres of the listed movies.\n\n(B) **Neon Bull**: This is a Brazilian drama film that explores the lives of workers in the Brazilian rodeo industry.
