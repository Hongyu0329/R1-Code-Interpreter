    "To find a movie similar to \"Batman,\" \"The Usual Suspects,\" \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" and \"Jurassic Park,\" we need to identify the common themes or genres among these films. \n\n1. **Batman**: This is a superhero film with elements of action, crime, and drama.\n2. **The Usual Suspects**: This is a crime thriller with a strong emphasis on mystery and suspense.\n3. **The Silence of the Lambs**: This is a psychological horror-thriller with elements of crime and mystery.\n4. **Jurassic Park**: This is a science fiction adventure film with elements of thriller and action.\n\nThe common elements among these films are crime, thriller, action, and suspense. \n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **The End of the Tour**: This is a drama film, focusing on a biographical story, which doesn't align with the common themes.\n(B) **Forrest Gump**: This is a drama and romance film with elements of comedy, which doesn't fit the common themes.\n(C) **Lust, Caution**: This is a romantic thriller, which has elements of thriller but is more focused on romance and espionage.\n(D) **Caution**: This seems to be part of the previous option, \"Lust, Caution.\"\n(E) **Shelter**: This is a drama film, which doesn't align with the common themes.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the combination of crime, thriller, action, and suspense. However, \"Lust, Caution\" (option C) is a romantic thriller, which at least contains the thriller element, making it the closest match among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
