It has a complex narrative but doesn't quite match the style of the films listed.\n\n(B) **Inception**: A science fiction thriller with a complex, non-linear narrative, similar to \"Pulp Fiction\" in storytelling style. It also has a dark tone and explores deep themes, akin to \"The Dark Knight.\"\n\n(C) **Identity Thief**: A comedy film, which doesn't align with the dark or complex themes of the films listed.\n\n(D) **War for the Planet of the Apes**: A science fiction film with a serious tone, but it focuses more on action and war themes, which are not as aligned with the psychological or narrative complexity of the listed films.\n\nBased on this analysis, **Inception** (Option B) is the most similar to the films listed, as it shares the complex narrative style of \"Pulp Fiction,\" the dark tone of \"The Dark Knight,\" and the psychological depth of \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\n<<<answer>>>B"
