    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is `< ( ( )`. \n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Analyze the input sequence:\n   - `<` is not a parenthesis, so it doesn't affect the balance.\n   - `(` increases the count of open parentheses.\n   - `)` decreases the count of open parentheses.\n\n2. Count the open and closed parentheses:\n   - Start with a count of 0.\n   - For each `(`, increase the count by 1.\n   - For each `)`, decrease the count by 1.\n\n3. After processing the input, if the count is greater than 0, it means there are unmatched open parentheses. We need to add the same number of `)` to balance the sequence.\n\n4. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary number of `)` to the input.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    open_count = 0\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char == '(':\n            open_count += 1\n        elif char == ')':\n            open_count -= 1\n\n    # Add the necessary number of closing parentheses\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence + ')' * open_count\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\ninput_sequence = \"< ( ( )\"\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the correct number of closing parentheses."
