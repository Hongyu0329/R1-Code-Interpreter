    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets, ensuring that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n`< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ]`\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - Open angle bracket\n2. `{` - Open curly brace\n3. `<` - Open angle bracket\n4. `[` - Open square bracket\n5. `[` - Open square bracket\n6. `(` - Open parenthesis\n7. `{ }` - Curly braces are already closed\n8. `)` - Close parenthesis\n9. `]` - Close square bracket\n10. `]` - Close square bracket\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n1. `>` - Close angle bracket (for the third character)\n2. `}` - Close curly brace (for the second character)\n3. `>` - Close angle bracket (for the first character)\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n`< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ] > } >`\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ] > } >\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "The current solution correctly identifies the sequence of brackets and outputs the completed sequence. However, the code is quite simple and does not demonstrate symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a stack-based approach to dynamically process and match the brackets, ensuring that each opening bracket is properly closed in the correct order. This will enhance the complexity and robustness of the solution. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, utilizing data structures like stacks to manage the bracket sequence.\n\nTo enhance the solution using a stack-based approach, we can utilize a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. As we iterate through the sequence, we'll push each opening bracket onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we'll pop the top of the stack to ensure it matches the correct type of opening bracket. This approach ensures that all brackets are properly matched and closed in the correct order.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Define a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.\n3. Iterate through the given sequence:\n   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack.\n4. After processing the sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need to be closed. Pop each one and append the corresponding closing bracket to the result.\n5. Construct the completed sequence and output it in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_bracket_sequence(sequence):\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Dictionary to map closing brackets to opening brackets\n    bracket_map = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    \n    # Result list to build the completed sequence\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in bracket_map.values():\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n            result.append(char)\n        elif char in bracket_map:\n            # If it's a closing bracket, check the stack\n            if stack and stack[-1] == bracket_map[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Close any remaining opening brackets in the stack\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        # Find the corresponding closing bracket\n        for close_bracket, open_bracket_match in bracket_map.items():\n            if open_bracket_match == open_bracket:\n                result.append(close_bracket)\n                break\n    \n    # Join the result list into a string\n    completed_sequence = ''.join(result)\n    \n    # Output the final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ]\"\n\n# Call the function with the input sequence\ncomplete_bracket_sequence(input_sequence)\n```"
