    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is:\n\n```\n[ < > ] [ [ < > ]\n```\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first part `[ < > ]` is already complete and properly closed.\n2. The second part `[ [ < > ]` starts with two opening brackets but only closes one. Therefore, we need to add a closing bracket `]` to properly close the sequence.\n\nThe completed sequence should be:\n\n```\n[ < > ] [ [ < > ] ]\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"[ < > ] [ [ < > ] ]\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "The current solution correctly identifies the need to close the brackets and outputs the correct sequence. However, the code is quite simple and does not demonstrate symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex approach that programmatically checks and balances the brackets. This could involve using a stack data structure to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, which would be more robust and scalable for larger sequences. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, rather than just simply displaying the answer.\n\nTo solve this problem using a more complex approach, we can use a stack data structure to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. This approach is more robust and can handle larger sequences efficiently. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each opening bracket (`[`, `<`), push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket (`]`, `>`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack. Otherwise, the sequence is unbalanced.\n5. After processing all characters, if the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and we need to add the corresponding closing brackets to balance the sequence.\n6. Construct the completed sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    completed_sequence = []\n\n    # Mapping of opening to closing brackets\n    matching_bracket = {'[': ']', '<': '>'}\n\n    for char in sequence:\n        completed_sequence.append(char)\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Unbalanced sequence, but we assume input is correct up to this point\n                pass\n\n    # Add necessary closing brackets for any unmatched opening brackets\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence.append(matching_bracket[stack.pop()])\n\n    return ''.join(completed_sequence)\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ < > ] [ [ < > \"\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to track unmatched opening brackets and appends the necessary closing brackets to balance the sequence. The final output is printed in the specified format."
