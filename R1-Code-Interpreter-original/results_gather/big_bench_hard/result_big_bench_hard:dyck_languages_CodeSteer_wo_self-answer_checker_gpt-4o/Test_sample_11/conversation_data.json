    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses so that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols in the correct order. The input sequence is `[ { < ( ) > }`. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `[`: This is an opening bracket and needs a corresponding closing bracket `]`.\n2. `{`: This is an opening brace and needs a corresponding closing brace `}`.\n3. `<`: This is an opening angle bracket and needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n4. `(`: This is an opening parenthesis and needs a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`.\n5. `)`: This is a closing parenthesis, which matches the last opened parenthesis.\n6. `>`: This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the last opened angle bracket.\n7. `}`: This is a closing brace, which matches the last opened brace.\n\nThe sequence is missing a closing bracket `]` to match the first opening bracket `[`. Therefore, the completed sequence should be `[ { < ( ) > } ]`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ { < ( ) > }\"\n\n# Complete the sequence by adding the missing closing bracket\ncompleted_sequence = input_sequence + \" ]\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
