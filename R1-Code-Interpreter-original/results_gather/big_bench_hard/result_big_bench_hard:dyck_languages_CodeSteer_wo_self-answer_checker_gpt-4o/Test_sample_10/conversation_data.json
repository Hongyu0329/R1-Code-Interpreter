    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and balanced. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, parentheses `( )`, and curly braces `{ }`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the input sequence from left to right.\n2. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`[`, `(`, `{`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`]`, `)`, `}`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack.\n4. After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets to be added to the sequence.\n5. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input sequence.\n6. Output the final sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}\n    opening_bracket = {'(', '[', '{'}\n    closing_bracket = {')', ']', '}'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in opening_bracket:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in closing_bracket:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Construct the final sequence\n    final_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        if open_bracket == '(':\n            final_sequence += ')'\n        elif open_bracket == '[':\n            final_sequence += ']'\n        elif open_bracket == '{':\n            final_sequence += '}'\n    \n    return f\"<<<{final_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ < [ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) < { < > } > [ ] > ] < ( ) > ( ( ( ) ) ) ( < >\"\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed and balanced."
