    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, parentheses `( )`, curly braces `{ }`, and angle brackets `< >`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Stack Data Structure**: Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. This is because the last opened bracket should be the first one to be closed, which is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.\n2. **Iterate through the Input**: For each character in the input sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`[`, `(`, `{`, `<`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`]`, `)`, `}`, `>`), check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid (but we assume the input is valid up to the point given).\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets. Pop each from the stack and append the appropriate closing bracket to the result.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {\n        '[': ']',\n        '(': ')',\n        '{': '}',\n        '<': '>'\n    }\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Given input\ninput_sequence = \"[ ] ( [ [ { < { { ( < > [ ] ) } } < > > } ] ] { }\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
