    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. \n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the input sequence and use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`<`, `[`, `{`, `(`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`>`, `]`, `}`, `)`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack.\n3. After processing the input, the stack will contain any unmatched opening brackets. We need to add the corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n4. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Construct the final sequence\n    final_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        final_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{final_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { }\"\n# Output the completed sequence\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",
