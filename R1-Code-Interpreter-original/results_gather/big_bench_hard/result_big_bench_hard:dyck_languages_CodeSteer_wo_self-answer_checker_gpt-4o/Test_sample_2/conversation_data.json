    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The sequence provided is a mix of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, square brackets `[]`, and parentheses `()`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the sequence from left to right.\n2. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`{`, `<`, `[`, or `(`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`}`, `>`, `]`, or `)`), check if it matches the top of the stack:\n     - If it matches, pop the stack.\n     - If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid (though this shouldn't happen with the given input).\n4. After processing the entire sequence, any remaining items in the stack are unmatched opening brackets. We need to add the corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n5. Output the completed sequence.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_brackets = {'{': '}', '<': '>', '[': ']', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"  # This shouldn't happen with the given input\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing brackets for unmatched opening brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ < { { [ ] } } { < [ { { < > } } [ ( ) ( ) ] [ [ [ [ ( { < ( < ( [ ] ) > ) > } ) ] ] ] ] ] ( ) ( [ ] { } ) > } > [ { ( ( ) ) } ]\"\n\n# Output the completed sequence\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed, formatted as requested."
