    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is balanced and properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, angle brackets `<>`, and square brackets `[]`. \n\nThe task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through the sequence:\n   - If an opening bracket is encountered, push it onto the stack.\n   - If a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is already invalid, but since we are completing it, we assume it will be valid.\n3. After processing the sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets.\n4. Append the necessary closing brackets to the sequence to balance it.\n5. Output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'{': '}', '(': ')', '<': '>', '[': ']'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                # If there's a mismatch, we assume the sequence is valid for completion\n                continue\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing brackets for remaining opening brackets in the stack\n    completion = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + completion\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ ( < > ) } ( ( [ ] ) < [ ( [ [ ] ] [ { } ] { } [ < { [ ] } > ] ( ) ) ]\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
