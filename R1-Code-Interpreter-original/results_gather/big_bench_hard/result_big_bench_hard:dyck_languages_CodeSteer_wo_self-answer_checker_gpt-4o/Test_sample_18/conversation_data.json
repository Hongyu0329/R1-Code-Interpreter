    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is:\n\n```\n( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) }\n```\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. We have two opening parentheses `(`, followed by two closing parentheses `)`. This part is already balanced.\n2. Next, we have an opening square bracket `[`, followed by an opening curly brace `{`, and then an opening parenthesis `(`.\n3. Inside the parenthesis, we have a pair of angle brackets `< >`, which is balanced.\n4. After the angle brackets, we have a closing parenthesis `)`, which balances the last opening parenthesis.\n5. We still need to close the curly brace `{` and the square bracket `[`.\n\nThe sequence needs to be completed by adding the necessary closing brackets to balance the entire sequence. The final sequence should be:\n\n```\n( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) } ]\n```\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) } ]\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
