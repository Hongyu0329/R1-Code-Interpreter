    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, parentheses `( )`, and angle brackets `< >`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. **Iterate through the Input**: For each character in the input sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`[`, `{`, `(`, `<`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`]`, `}`, `)`, `>`), check if it matches the top of the stack:\n     - If it matches, pop the stack.\n     - If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid (but we assume the input is valid up to the point given).\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets. Pop each from the stack and append the appropriate closing bracket to the sequence.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Initialize a stack\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ ] { ( ( < { ( ( ( { < > ( ) } ) ) [ { } ] { { ( ) } } ) } < > >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",
    "The current code implementation correctly uses a stack to manage the opening and closing of brackets, ensuring that the sequence is completed properly. The complexity analysis indicates that the code uses systematic searching and symbolic computing effectively. Since the code produces the correct output without errors, you can proceed with this solution. If further optimization or additional features are not required, you can consider this task complete.\n\nThank you for your feedback. I'm glad the solution meets your requirements. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance with this task or any other, feel free to ask."
