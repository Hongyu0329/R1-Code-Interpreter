    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses, ensuring that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, and `}`.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the input sequence from left to right.\n2. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`<`, `(`, `[`, `{`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`>`, `)`, `]`, `}`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack.\n4. After processing the input sequence, the stack will contain the unmatched opening brackets.\n5. To complete the sequence, append the corresponding closing brackets for each unmatched opening bracket in the stack, in reverse order.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the corresponding closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"<(( [<>{[{()}]<{<{}>[<>()]}>}] )){{({(([([])]<{}>)){ {([[]])}[()]{ {[]} } }})}({})}\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the format `<<<answer>>>`.",
