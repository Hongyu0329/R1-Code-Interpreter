    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses so that all the parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is `( { { } }`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Count the number of each type of opening and closing parentheses: `(`, `{`, `)`, and `}`.\n2. Determine how many of each type of closing parenthesis is needed to balance the sequence.\n3. Append the necessary closing parentheses to the sequence to make it balanced.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- We have 1 opening parenthesis `(` and 1 closing parenthesis `)`.\n- We have 2 opening curly braces `{` and 1 closing curly brace `}`.\n\nTo balance the sequence:\n- We need 1 more closing curly brace `}` to match the 2 opening curly braces `{`.\n\nThe completed sequence should be `( { { } } )`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Count the number of each type of parenthesis\n    open_paren = sequence.count('(')\n    close_paren = sequence.count(')')\n    open_brace = sequence.count('{')\n    close_brace = sequence.count('}')\n\n    # Calculate the needed closing parentheses\n    needed_close_paren = open_paren - close_paren\n    needed_close_brace = open_brace - close_brace\n\n    # Complete the sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_close_paren + '}' * needed_close_brace\n\n    return completed_sequence\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( { { } }\"\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the format `<<<answer>>>`."
