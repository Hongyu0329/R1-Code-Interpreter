    "The current solution simply outputs the input sequence without any additional processing or validation. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex approach that involves parsing the sequence to ensure all brackets are properly matched and closed. This can be achieved by using a stack data structure to track opening brackets and ensure they are closed in the correct order. Additionally, ensure that the output format matches the required format by correctly placing the sequence within the specified delimiters.\n\nTo ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly matched and closed, we can use a stack data structure. The stack will help us track opening brackets and ensure they are closed in the correct order. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate through each character in the sequence.\n3. For each opening bracket (`<`, `(`, `{`, `[`), push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket (`>`, `)`, `}`, `]`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack. If not, the sequence is invalid.\n5. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the sequence is valid and properly closed. Otherwise, it is not.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'>': '<', ')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n    # Initialize an empty stack\n    stack = []\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '<({[':\n            # Push opening brackets onto the stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in '>)}]':\n            # Check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_pairs[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return False\n    \n    # If the stack is empty, all brackets are properly closed\n    return len(stack) == 0\n\nsequence = \"< ( ( ( < > ) ) ( { { } [ { } ] [ ] < ( ) > } ) )\"\nif is_valid_sequence(sequence):\n    print(f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The sequence is not properly closed.\")\n```\n\nThis code will check if the sequence is valid and properly closed, and then output it in the specified format. If the sequence is not valid, it will indicate that the sequence is not properly closed.",
    "The current implementation correctly uses a stack to validate the sequence of brackets, but it seems to incorrectly determine that the sequence is not properly closed. Double-check the logic for matching pairs and ensure that the input sequence is processed correctly. Additionally, ensure that the output format matches the required format by correctly placing the sequence within the specified delimiters. Consider debugging the code to identify any logical errors that may cause the incorrect validation result.\n\nLet's review the logic and ensure that the sequence is processed correctly.

Let's ensure that the logic is correctly implemented and debug any potential issues:\n\n1. We need to ensure that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket.\n2.

If the sequence is valid, it will print the sequence within the specified delimiters. If there is an error in the logic, it will indicate that the sequence is not properly closed. \n\nUpon reviewing the sequence and the logic, the sequence should indeed be valid, and the code should output the sequence correctly. If there was an issue previously, it might have been due to a typo or a small logical error that has now been corrected.",

    "The current implementation correctly uses a stack to validate the sequence of brackets and includes debug statements to trace the stack's state.
