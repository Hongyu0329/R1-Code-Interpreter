    "To solve the expression `not not (True) and not False`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - `not not (True)`: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not True` becomes `False`, and `not False` becomes `True`. Therefore, `not not (True)` simplifies to `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part**:\n   - `not False`: This simplifies to `True` because `not` negates `False`.\n\n3. **Combine the results with the `and` operator**:\n   - We now have `True and True`. The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. Therefore, `True and True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a small Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not (True) and not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `not not (True) and not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
