    "To solve the logical expression `True and not False or False and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Substitute the result back into the expression: `True and True or False and False`.\n3. Evaluate `True and True`: This becomes `True`.\n4. Substitute the result back into the expression: `True or False and False`.\n5. Evaluate `False and False`: This becomes `False`.\n6. Substitute the result back into the expression: `True or False`.\n7. Evaluate `True or False`: This becomes `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure our manual evaluation is correct.\n\n```python\nresult = True and not False or False and False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and return the result of the logical expression.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual evaluation. The logical expression `True and not False or False and False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
