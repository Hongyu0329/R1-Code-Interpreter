    "To solve the expression `True or (True or not False)`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated expression**:\n   - The expression becomes `True or (True or True)`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Substitute the evaluated expression**:\n   - The expression becomes `True or True`.\n\n5. **Evaluate the final expression**:\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = True or (True or not False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
