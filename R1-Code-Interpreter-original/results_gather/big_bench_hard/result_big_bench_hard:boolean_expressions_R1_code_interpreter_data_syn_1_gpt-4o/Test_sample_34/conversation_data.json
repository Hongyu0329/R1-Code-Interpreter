    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression `not not not not not not not False is`. This expression involves a series of `not` operations applied to the boolean value `False`.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost value: `False`.\n2. Apply the first `not`: `not False` becomes `True`.\n3. Apply the second `not`: `not True` becomes `False`.\n4. Apply the third `not`: `not False` becomes `True`.\n5. Apply the fourth `not`: `not True` becomes `False`.\n6. Apply the fifth `not`: `not False` becomes `True`.\n7. Apply the sixth `not`: `not True` becomes `False`.\n8. Apply the seventh `not`: `not False` becomes `True`.\n\nAfter applying all the `not` operations, the final result is `True`.\n\nNow, let's verify this using a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not not not not not not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression `not not not not not not not False` is `True`. Therefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
