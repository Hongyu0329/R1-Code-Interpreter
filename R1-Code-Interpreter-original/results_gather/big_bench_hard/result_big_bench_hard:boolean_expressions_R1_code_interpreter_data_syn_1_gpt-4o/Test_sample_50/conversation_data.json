    "To solve the expression `not False or False or (False)`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **not False**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **True or False**: The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since the first operand is `True`, the result of `True or False` is `True`.\n\n3. **True or (False)**: Again, using the `or` operator, since the first operand is `True`, the result of `True or (False)` is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not False or False or (False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression `not False or False or (False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
