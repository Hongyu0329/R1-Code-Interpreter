    "To solve the expression `not True and (False or True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(False or True)`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since one of the operands is `True`, the result is `True`.\n\n2. Now the expression becomes: `not True and True`.\n\n3. Evaluate the `not` operator: `not True`.\n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. So, `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n4. Now the expression is: `False and True`.\n\n5. Evaluate the `and` operator: `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not True and (False or True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `not True and (False or True)` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
