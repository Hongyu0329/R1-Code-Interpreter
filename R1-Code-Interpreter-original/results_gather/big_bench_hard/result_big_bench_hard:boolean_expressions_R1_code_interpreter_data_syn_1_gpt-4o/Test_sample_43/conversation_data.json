    "To solve the expression `not False or True and not not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:**  \n   `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not not True`:**  \n   `not not True` is `True` because the first `not` negates `True` to `False`, and the second `not` negates `False` back to `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `True and True`:**  \n   Since both operands are `True`, the result is `True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `True or True`:**  \n   Since at least one operand is `True`, the result is `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure our logical evaluation is correct.\n\n```python\nresult = not False or True and not not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms our logical evaluation. The expression `not False or True and not not True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
