    "To solve the expression `(not False and (True))`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:** \n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. \n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `True and (True)`:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n   - Since both operands are `True`, the result of `True and True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `(not False and (True))` evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = (not False and (True))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the evaluation of the expression.",
