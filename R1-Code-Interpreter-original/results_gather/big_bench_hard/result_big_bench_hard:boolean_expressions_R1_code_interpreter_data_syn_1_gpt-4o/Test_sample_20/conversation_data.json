    "To solve the expression `True and False or ( not True )`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - `( not True )` evaluates to `False` because the NOT operator negates the value of `True`.\n\n2. **AND**: Next, evaluate the AND operation.\n   - `True and False` evaluates to `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n\n3. **OR**: Finally, evaluate the OR operation.\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False` because at least one operand needs to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = True and False or ( not True )\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our step-by-step evaluation of the logical expression. The final result of the expression `True and False or ( not True )` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
