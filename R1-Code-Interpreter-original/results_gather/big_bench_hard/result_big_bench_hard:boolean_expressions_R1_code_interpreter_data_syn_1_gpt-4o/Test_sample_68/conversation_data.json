    "To solve the expression `True or ( not ( True ) )`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - The innermost expression is `not (True)`. \n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value, so `not (True)` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated expression back**:\n   - Now the expression becomes `True or False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operation**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since the first operand is `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `True or ( not ( True ) )` is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = True or (not True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm our evaluation.",
