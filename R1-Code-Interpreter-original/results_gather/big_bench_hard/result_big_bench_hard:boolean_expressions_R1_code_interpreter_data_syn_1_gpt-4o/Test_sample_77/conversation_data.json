    "To solve the expression `( True ) and True and not True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The expression `( True )` is simply `True` because the parentheses do not change the value.\n\n2. **Logical AND**: The expression `True and True` evaluates to `True` because both operands are `True`.\n\n3. **Logical NOT**: The expression `not True` evaluates to `False` because the `not` operator negates the value of `True`.\n\n4. **Combining the results**: Now we have `True and False`. The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = (True) and True and not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `( True ) and True and not True` evaluates to `False`. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
