    "To solve the expression `not False or True and False and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators in Python. The order of precedence is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Evaluate `True and False`: This becomes `False`.\n3. Evaluate `False and False`: This remains `False`.\n4. Now, the expression is `True or False and False`.\n5. Evaluate `False and False`: This remains `False`.\n6. Finally, evaluate `True or False`: This becomes `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = not False or True and False and False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
