    "To solve the expression `False or not not not False and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not not not False`:**\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n   So, `not not not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `True and True`:**\n   - Since both operands are `True`, the result is `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `False or True`:**\n   - Since one of the operands is `True`, the result is `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure our manual evaluation is correct.\n\n```python\nresult = False or not not not False and True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual evaluation. The expression `False or not not not False and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
