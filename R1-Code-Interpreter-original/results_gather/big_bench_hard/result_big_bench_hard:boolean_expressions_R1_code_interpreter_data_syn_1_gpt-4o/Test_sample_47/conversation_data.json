    "To solve the expression `not not (not False or True)`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operations involved.\n\n1. **Inner Parentheses Evaluation**: \n   - Inside the parentheses, we have `not False or True`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - So, the expression inside the parentheses becomes `True or True`.\n\n2. **OR Operation**:\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Double NOT Operation**:\n   - We now have `not not True`.\n   - The first `not` negates `True` to `False`.\n   - The second `not` negates `False` back to `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `not not (not False or True)` evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a small Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not (not False or True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
