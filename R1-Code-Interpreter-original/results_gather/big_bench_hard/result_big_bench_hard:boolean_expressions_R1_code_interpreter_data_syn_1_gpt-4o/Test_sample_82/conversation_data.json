    "To solve the expression `not not not False and True or False`, we need to understand the order of operations and how logical operators work in Python.\n\n1. **Order of Operations**: In Python, logical operators have the following precedence:\n   - `not` has the highest precedence.\n   - `and` has the next highest precedence.\n   - `or` has the lowest precedence.\n\n2. **Evaluation**:\n   - Start with `not not not False`. The `not` operator negates the boolean value.\n     - `not False` becomes `True`.\n     - `not True` becomes `False`.\n     - `not False` becomes `True`.\n   - Now the expression is `True and True or False`.\n   - Evaluate `True and True`. The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n     - `True and True` is `True`.\n   - Now the expression is `True or False`.\n   - Evaluate `True or False`. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.\n     - `True or False` is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not not False and True or False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `not not not False and True or False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    not not not False and True or False is\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
