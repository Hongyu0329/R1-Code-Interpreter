    "To solve the expression `(not not True and not False)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **not not True**: \n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value. \n   - `not True` becomes `False`.\n   - `not not True` negates `False` again, resulting in `True`.\n\n2. **not False**:\n   - `not False` negates `False`, resulting in `True`.\n\n3. **True and True**:\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n   - Since both are `True`, the result is `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our logical reasoning is correct.\n\n```python\nresult = (not not True and not False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    ( not not True and not False ) is\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
