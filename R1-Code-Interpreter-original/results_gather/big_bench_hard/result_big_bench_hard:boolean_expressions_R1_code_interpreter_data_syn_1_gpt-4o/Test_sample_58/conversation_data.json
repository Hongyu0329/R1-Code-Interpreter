    "To solve the expression `True and not False and not not True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **not False**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **not not True**: The `not` operator is applied twice here. The first `not` negates `True` to `False`, and the second `not` negates `False` back to `True`. So, `not not True` is `True`.\n\n3. **True and True and True**: Now, the expression simplifies to `True and True and True`. The `and` operator returns `True` if all operands are `True`. Since all parts of the expression are `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a small Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = True and not False and not not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the evaluation of the expression.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is `True`, which confirms our step-by-step evaluation of the expression.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
