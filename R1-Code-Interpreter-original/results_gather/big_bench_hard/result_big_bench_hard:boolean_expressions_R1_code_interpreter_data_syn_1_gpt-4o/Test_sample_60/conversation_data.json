    "To solve the expression `not not (False and not True)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: `not True` is `False`.\n2. **Evaluate the `and` operation**: `False and False` is `False`.\n3. **Apply the first `not`**: `not False` is `True`.\n4. **Apply the second `not`**: `not True` is `False`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure our logical steps are correct.\n\n```python\nresult = not not (False and not True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    not not ( False and not True ) is\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
