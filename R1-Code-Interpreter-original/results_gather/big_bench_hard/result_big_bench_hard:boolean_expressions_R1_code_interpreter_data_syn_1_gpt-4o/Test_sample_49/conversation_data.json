    "To solve the expression `False or ( not False ) and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, it's `not False`.\n2. **NOT**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n3. **AND**: Next, we evaluate the `and` operation. The expression now is `True and True`.\n4. **OR**: Finally, we evaluate the `or` operation. The expression becomes `False or True`.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the final expression using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nresult = False or (not False) and True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression `False or ( not False ) and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
