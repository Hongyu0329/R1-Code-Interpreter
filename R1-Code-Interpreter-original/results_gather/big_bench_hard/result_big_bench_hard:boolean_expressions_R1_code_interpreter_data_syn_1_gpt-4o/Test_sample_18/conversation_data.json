    "To solve the logical expression `False and False and False or not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. The expression now is `False and False and False or True`.\n3. Evaluate `False and False and False`: This results in `False` because all operands are `False`.\n4. The expression now is `False or True`.\n5. Evaluate `False or True`: This results in `True` because at least one operand is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = False and False and False or not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The logical expression `False and False and False or not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
