    "To solve the expression `True and (False) or not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. Parentheses `()`\n2. `not`\n3. `and`\n4. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, it's just `False`, so it remains `False`.\n\n2. **Not**: The `not` operator negates the value of `False`, turning it into `True`.\n\n3. **And**: Now, evaluate the `and` operation. The expression is `True and False`. The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n4. **Or**: Finally, evaluate the `or` operation. The expression is `False or True`. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since one of the operands is `True`, the result is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = True and (False) or not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will evaluate the expression and print the result. Let's execute it to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `True and (False) or not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
