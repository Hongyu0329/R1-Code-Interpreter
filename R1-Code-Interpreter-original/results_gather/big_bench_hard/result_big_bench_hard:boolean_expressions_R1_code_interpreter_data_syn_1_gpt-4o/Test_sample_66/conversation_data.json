    "To solve the expression `not ( False ) or not not True`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not (False)`:** \n   - `False` is a boolean value.\n   - `not (False)` negates `False`, resulting in `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not not True`:**\n   - `True` is a boolean value.\n   - The first `not` negates `True`, resulting in `False`.\n   - The second `not` negates `False`, resulting in `True`.\n\n3. **Combine the results with `or`:**\n   - We have `True or True`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not (False) or not not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
