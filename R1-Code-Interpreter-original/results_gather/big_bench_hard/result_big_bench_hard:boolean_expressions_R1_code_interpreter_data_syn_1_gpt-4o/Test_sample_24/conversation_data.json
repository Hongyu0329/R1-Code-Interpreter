    "To solve the expression `(True and not not not True)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the `not` operator**: The `not` operator in Python is a logical negation. It inverts the truth value of the operand. So, `not True` becomes `False`, and `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not not not True`**:\n   - Start with the innermost `not`: `not True` becomes `False`.\n   - Apply the next `not`: `not False` becomes `True`.\n   - Apply the final `not`: `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the entire expression**: Now that we have `True and False`, we can evaluate the `and` operator.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `True and False` is `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a small Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = (True and not not not True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `(True and not not not True)` evaluates to `False`. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
