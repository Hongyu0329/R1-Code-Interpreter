    "To solve the expression `not not True and not False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the precedence of logical operators in Python. The precedence order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. `not not True`: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not True` is `False`, and `not not True` is `True`.\n2. `not False`: This is `True` because `not` negates `False`.\n3. Now, the expression becomes `True and True or True`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the `and` operator:\n\n4. `True and True`: This evaluates to `True`.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the `or` operator:\n\n5. `True or True`: This evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = not not True and not False or True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression `not not True and not False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    not not True and not False or True is\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
