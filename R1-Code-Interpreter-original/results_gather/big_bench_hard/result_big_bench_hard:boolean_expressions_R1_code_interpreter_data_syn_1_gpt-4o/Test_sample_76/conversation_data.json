    "To solve the expression `False or True and not not not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not not not False`:\n   - `not False` is `True`\n   - `not True` is `False`\n   - `not False` is `True`\n\n2. Now the expression becomes `False or True and True`.\n\n3. Evaluate `True and True`:\n   - This is `True`.\n\n4. Now the expression becomes `False or True`.\n\n5. Evaluate `False or True`:\n   - This is `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = False or True and not not not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result.",
