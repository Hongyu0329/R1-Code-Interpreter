    "To solve the expression `not not (False or not True)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `or` expression**:\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **Apply the first `not`**:\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Apply the second `not`**:\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `not not (False or not True)` evaluates to `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not (False or not True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the evaluation of the expression.",
