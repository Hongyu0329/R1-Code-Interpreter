    "To solve the expression `(not True) and True and False`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operators in Python.\n\n1. **not True**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **False and True**: The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n3. **False and False**: Again, using the `and` operator, since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = (not True) and True and False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is `False`, which confirms our step-by-step evaluation of the expression.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
