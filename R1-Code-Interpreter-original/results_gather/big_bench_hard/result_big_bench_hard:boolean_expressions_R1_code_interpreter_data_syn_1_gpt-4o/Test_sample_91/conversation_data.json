    "To solve the expression `(False) or not False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: There are no parentheses that change the order of operations here, so we can proceed with the default order.\n2. **Not Operator**: The `not` operator has the highest precedence, so we evaluate `not False` first. `not False` is `True`.\n3. **Or Operator**: The `or` operator is evaluated from left to right. The expression now becomes `False or True or True`.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n- `False or True` evaluates to `True` because `or` returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.\n- Now, we have `True or True`, which is also `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nTo confirm this, let's write a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = (False) or not False or True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual evaluation. The expression `(False) or not False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
