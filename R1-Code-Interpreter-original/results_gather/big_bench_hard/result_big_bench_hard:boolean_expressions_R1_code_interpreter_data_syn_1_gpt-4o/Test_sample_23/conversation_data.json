    "To solve the expression `not ( True ) or False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not (True)`**: \n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value. \n   - `not (True)` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `False or False or True`**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - The expression `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n   - Then, `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not (True) or False or True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to verify the result.",
