    "To solve the expression `not not (False and not False)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Inner Expression**: Start with the innermost expression, which is `not False`. The `not` operator negates the boolean value, so `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **And Operation**: Now, substitute the result back into the expression: `False and True`. The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `False and True` is `False`.\n\n3. **Double Negation**: Finally, apply the double negation `not not` to the result. The first `not` negates `False` to `True`, and the second `not` negates `True` back to `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a small Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not (False and not False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `not not (False and not False)` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
