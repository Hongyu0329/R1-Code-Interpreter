    "To solve the expression `not not False or False and not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators in Python, which is similar to standard logical operations:\n\n1. `not` has the highest precedence and is evaluated first.\n2. `and` is evaluated next.\n3. `or` is evaluated last.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not not False`: \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n\n2. Evaluate `not True`: \n   - This is `False`.\n\n3. Now substitute these results back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `False or False and False`.\n\n4. Evaluate `False and False`: \n   - This is `False`.\n\n5. Finally, evaluate `False or False`: \n   - This is `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not False or False and not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `not not False or False and not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
