    "To solve the expression `(False) or False and not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators in Python, which is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not True`: This becomes `False`.\n2. Evaluate `False and False`: Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n3. Evaluate `False or False`: Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = (False) or False and not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual evaluation of the expression. The expression `(False) or False and not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
