    "To solve the logical expression `True or True or not False or False`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **not False**: The `not` operator negates the value of `False`, turning it into `True`.\n\n2. **True or True or True or False**: Now, the expression becomes `True or True or True or False`.\n\n3. **True or True**: The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since the first operand is `True`, the result is `True`.\n\n4. **True or True**: The next part of the expression is `True or True`, which also evaluates to `True`.\n\n5. **True or False**: Finally, `True or False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nSince the entire expression evaluates to `True`, we can conclude the final result.\n\nLet's confirm this by evaluating the expression using Python code.\n\n```python\nresult = True or True or not False or False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to confirm the result.",
