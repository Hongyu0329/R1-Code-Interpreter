    "To solve the expression `not not False and not not not False`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the precedence and associativity of the logical operators.\n\n1. **not not False**: \n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **not not not False**:\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Combining the results with 'and'**:\n   - We have `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure our logical reasoning is correct.\n\n```python\nresult = not not False and not not not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result of the expression.",
