    "To solve the expression `not ( True or True or False )`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**: \n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `True or True or False`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - In this case, `True or True` evaluates to `True`, and `True or False` also evaluates to `True`.\n   - Therefore, the entire expression inside the parentheses evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Apply the `not` operator**:\n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value.\n   - Since the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to `True`, applying `not` to it will result in `False`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not (True or True or False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is `False`, which confirms our manual evaluation of the expression.\n\nThe expression `not ( True or True or False )` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
