    "To solve the expression `False or ( False ) and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, it's just `False`, so it remains `False`.\n\n2. **NOT**: Apply the NOT operator to `False`. The NOT operator inverts the boolean value, so `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **AND**: Evaluate the AND operation. The expression now is `False or (False and True)`. According to the order of operations, we evaluate `False and True` first. The AND operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **OR**: Finally, evaluate the OR operation. The expression is now `False or False`. The OR operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = False or (False and not False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our step-by-step evaluation of the logical expression. The final result of the expression `False or ( False ) and not False` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
