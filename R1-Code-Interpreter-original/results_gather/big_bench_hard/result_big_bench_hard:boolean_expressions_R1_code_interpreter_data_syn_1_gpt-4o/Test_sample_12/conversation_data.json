    "To solve the expression `not True or False or not not True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operators in Python.\n\n1. **not True**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **not not True**: The `not` operator is applied twice. The first `not` negates `True` to `False`, and the second `not` negates `False` back to `True`.\n\n3. Now, substitute these results back into the original expression: `False or False or True`.\n\n4. **or Operator**: The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n   - Evaluate `False or False`: This results in `False` because both operands are `False`.\n   - Evaluate `False or True`: This results in `True` because one of the operands is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not True or False or not not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual evaluation. The expression `not True or False or not not True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
