    "To solve the expression `True or not False and True and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators in Python, which is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. The expression now is `True or True and True and False`.\n3. Evaluate `True and True`: This becomes `True`.\n4. The expression now is `True or True and False`.\n5. Evaluate `True and False`: This becomes `False`.\n6. The expression now is `True or False`.\n7. Finally, evaluate `True or False`: This becomes `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = True or not False and True and False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final answer.",
