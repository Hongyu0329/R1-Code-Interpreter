    "To solve the expression `not True or False or (False) is`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step. The expression involves logical operators `not`, `or`, and parentheses for grouping.\n\n1. **Evaluate the `not` operator**: \n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `or` operator**: \n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - The expression now becomes `False or False or (False)`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operation**:\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `False or (False)` evaluates to `False`.\n\nThe entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not True or False or (False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression `not True or False or (False)` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
