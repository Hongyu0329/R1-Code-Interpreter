    "To solve the expression `False and not (False or False)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**: `False or False`\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n2. **Apply the `not` operator**: `not (False)`\n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the entire expression**: `False and True`\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since the first operand is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = False and not (False or False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
