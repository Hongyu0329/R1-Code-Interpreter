    "To solve the expression `False or ( False ) or not True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not True`:** \n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. So, `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated part back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False or ( False ) or False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operations:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - In the expression `False or ( False ) or False`, all operands are `False`.\n   - Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = False or (False) or not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to verify the result.",
