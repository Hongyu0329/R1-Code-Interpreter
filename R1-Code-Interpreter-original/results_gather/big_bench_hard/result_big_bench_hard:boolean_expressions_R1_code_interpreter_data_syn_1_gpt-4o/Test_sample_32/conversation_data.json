    "To solve the expression `(True) and True or not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators in Python, which is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not True`: \n   - `not True` is `False`.\n\n2. Evaluate `(True) and True`:\n   - Both operands are `True`, so the result is `True`.\n\n3. Evaluate `True or False`:\n   - The first operand is `True`, so the result is `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = (True) and True or not True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is `True`. This confirms our step-by-step evaluation of the expression `(True) and True or not True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
