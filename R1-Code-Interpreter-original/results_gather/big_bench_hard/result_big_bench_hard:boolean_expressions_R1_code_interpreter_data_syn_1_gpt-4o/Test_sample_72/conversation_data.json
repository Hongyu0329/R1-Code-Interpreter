    "To solve the expression `(not False) and False or True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:**  \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `True and False`:**  \n   - Now, replace `not False` with `True` in the expression, so it becomes `True and False or True`.\n   - `True and False` is `False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `False or True`:**  \n   - Replace `True and False` with `False`, so the expression becomes `False or True`.\n   - `False or True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `(not False) and False or True` is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = (not False) and False or True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression `(not False) and False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
