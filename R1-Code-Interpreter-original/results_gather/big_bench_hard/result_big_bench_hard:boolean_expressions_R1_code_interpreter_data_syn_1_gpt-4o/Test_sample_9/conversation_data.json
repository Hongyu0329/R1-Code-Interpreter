    "To solve the expression `not True or (True or False)`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Evaluate the inner expression**: \n   - `True or False` evaluates to `True` because the `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` operator**:\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False` because the `not` operator inverts the boolean value.\n\n3. **Evaluate the outer expression**:\n   - Now we have `False or True`. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not True or (True or False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will evaluate the expression and print the result. Let's execute it.",
