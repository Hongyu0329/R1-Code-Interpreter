    "To solve the expression `(False or not False or False)`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **not False**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **False or True or False**: Now, we have the expression `False or True or False`. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n\n3. Evaluate `False or True`: This part of the expression evaluates to `True` because one of the operands is `True`.\n\n4. Evaluate `True or False`: This part of the expression also evaluates to `True` because one of the operands is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `(False or not False or False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = (False or not False or False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
