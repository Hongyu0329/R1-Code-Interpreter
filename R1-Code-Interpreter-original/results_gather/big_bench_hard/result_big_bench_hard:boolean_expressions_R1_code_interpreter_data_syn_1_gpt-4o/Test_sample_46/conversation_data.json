    "To solve the expression `( ( not True ) or True )`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression becomes `( False or True )`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operation**:\n   - The `or` operation returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since one of the operands is `True`, the result of `False or True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `( ( not True ) or True )` is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = ( ( not True ) or True )\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the logical evaluation.",
