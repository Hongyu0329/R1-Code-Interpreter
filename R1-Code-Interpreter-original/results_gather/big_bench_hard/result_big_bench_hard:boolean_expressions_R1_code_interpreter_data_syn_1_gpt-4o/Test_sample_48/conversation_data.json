    "To solve the expression `not True or False or (True)`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate any expressions within parentheses first. In this case, `(True)` is simply `True`.\n\n2. **Not**: The `not` operator has a higher precedence than `or`, so we evaluate `not True` first. `not True` is `False`.\n\n3. **Or**: The `or` operator evaluates to `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. The expression now is `False or False or True`.\n\n4. **Left to Right**: The `or` operator is evaluated from left to right. \n   - `False or False` is `False`.\n   - `False or True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not True or False or (True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to confirm the result.",
