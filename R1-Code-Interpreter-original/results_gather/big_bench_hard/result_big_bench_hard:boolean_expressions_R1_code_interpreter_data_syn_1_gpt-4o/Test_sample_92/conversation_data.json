    "To solve the expression `(not False) or (True)`, we need to evaluate each part of the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:** \n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. \n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `True`:** \n   - The value `True` is already a boolean `True`.\n\n3. **Combine with `or`:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since `not False` evaluates to `True`, the expression `True or True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `(not False) or (True)` evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = (not False) or (True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the evaluation of the expression.",
