    "To solve the expression `(False) and not False and True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: There are no operations inside parentheses to evaluate first, as `(False)` is just `False`.\n\n2. **Not Operator**: The `not` operator has higher precedence than `and`, so we evaluate `not False` first. `not False` is `True`.\n\n3. **And Operator**: The `and` operator is evaluated from left to right. The expression now is `False and True and True`.\n\n   - Evaluate `False and True`: This results in `False` because `and` requires both operands to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n\n   - Now, evaluate `False and True`: This is still `False` for the same reason.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a small Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = (False) and not False and True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `(False) and not False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
