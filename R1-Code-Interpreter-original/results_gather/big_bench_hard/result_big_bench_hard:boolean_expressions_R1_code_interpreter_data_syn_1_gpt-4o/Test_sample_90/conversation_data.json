    "To solve the expression `not False and False and False or False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True` because `not` inverts the boolean value.\n2. Now the expression is `True and False and False or False`.\n3. Evaluate `True and False`: This becomes `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the `and` operator to return `True`.\n4. Now the expression is `False and False or False`.\n5. Evaluate `False and False`: This becomes `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the `and` operator to return `True`.\n6. Now the expression is `False or False`.\n7. Evaluate `False or False`: This becomes `False` because at least one operand needs to be `True` for the `or` operator to return `True`.\n\nThe final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = not False and False and False or False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual evaluation. The expression `not False and False and False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
