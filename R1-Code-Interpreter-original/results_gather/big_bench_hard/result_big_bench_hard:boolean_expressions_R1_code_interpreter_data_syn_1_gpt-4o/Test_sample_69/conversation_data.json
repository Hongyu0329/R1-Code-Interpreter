    "To solve the expression `(False or True and not True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not True`:**  \n   The `not` operator negates the value of `True`, so `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `True and not True`:**  \n   After evaluating `not True` to `False`, the expression becomes `True and False`.  \n   The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `False or (True and not True)`:**  \n   Now, the expression is `False or False`.  \n   The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `(False or True and not True)` is `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = (False or True and not True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `(False or True and not True)` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
