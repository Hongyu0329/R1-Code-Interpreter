    "To solve the expression `not not True and not True or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the precedence of logical operators in Python. The precedence order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. `not not True`: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not True` becomes `False`, and `not not True` becomes `True`.\n\n2. `not True`: This becomes `False`.\n\nNow, substitute these results back into the expression:\n\n- The expression becomes `True and False or True`.\n\n3. `True and False`: The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. Here, it returns `False` because one operand is `False`.\n\n4. `False or True`: The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`. Here, it returns `True` because one operand is `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not True and not True or True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression evaluates to `True`. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
