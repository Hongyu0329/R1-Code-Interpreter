    "To solve the expression `True or ( ( not True ) )`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - The innermost expression is `( not True )`. \n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value, so `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated expression back**:\n   - The expression now becomes `True or False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operation**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since the first operand is `True`, the result of `True or False` is `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our logical evaluation is correct.\n\n```python\nresult = True or (not True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the logical expression.",
