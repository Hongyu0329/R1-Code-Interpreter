    "To solve the expression `not not False or not False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **not not False**: \n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **not False**: \n   - This evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **True**: \n   - This is already `True`.\n\nNow, we combine these results using the `or` operator:\n\n- The expression becomes `False or True or True`.\n\nThe `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since we have `True` in the expression, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not False or not False or True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the evaluation of the expression.",
