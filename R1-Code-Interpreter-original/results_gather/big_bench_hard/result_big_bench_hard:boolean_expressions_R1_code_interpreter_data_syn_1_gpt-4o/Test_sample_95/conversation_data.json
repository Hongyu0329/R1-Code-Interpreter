    "To solve the expression `False or not False and (False)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, it's just `False`, so it remains `False`.\n\n2. **NOT**: The `not` operator has higher precedence than `and` and `or`. So, we evaluate `not False`, which is `True`.\n\n3. **AND**: Next, we evaluate the `and` operation. The expression now is `True and False`. The result of `True and False` is `False`.\n\n4. **OR**: Finally, we evaluate the `or` operation. The expression now is `False or False`. The result of `False or False` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `False or not False and (False)` is `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = False or not False and (False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. The expression `False or not False and (False)` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
