    "To solve the expression `not False or ( ( False ) )`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:** \n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value. \n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression `True or ( ( False ) )`:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since the left operand is `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the expression `not False or ( ( False ) )` evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not False or ( ( False ) )\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
