    "To solve the expression `False and False or not (True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, it's just `True`, so it remains `True`.\n\n2. **NOT**: Apply the NOT operator to the result of the parentheses. `not (True)` becomes `False`.\n\n3. **AND**: Evaluate the AND operation. The expression now is `False and False`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n4. **OR**: Finally, evaluate the OR operation. The expression now is `False or False`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = False and False or not (True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual evaluation of the logical expression. The expression `False and False or not (True)` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
