    "To solve the expression `False or not False or True and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. The expression now is `False or True or True and True`.\n3. Evaluate `True and True`: This becomes `True`.\n4. The expression now is `False or True or True`.\n5. Evaluate `False or True`: This becomes `True`.\n6. The expression now is `True or True`.\n7. Evaluate `True or True`: This becomes `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = False or not False or True and True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual evaluation. The expression `False or not False or True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
