    "To solve the expression `not True or (False and True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first: `(False and True)`.\n   - `False and True` evaluates to `False` because both conditions need to be `True` for an `AND` operation to result in `True`.\n\n2. **NOT**: Apply the `not` operator to `True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **OR**: Now evaluate the `or` operation: `False or False`.\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False` because at least one condition needs to be `True` for an `OR` operation to result in `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not True or (False and True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our step-by-step evaluation of the logical expression. The final result of the expression `not True or (False and True)` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
