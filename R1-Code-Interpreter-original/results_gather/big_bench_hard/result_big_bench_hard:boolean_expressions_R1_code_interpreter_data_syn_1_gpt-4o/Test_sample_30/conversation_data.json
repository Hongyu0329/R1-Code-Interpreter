    "To solve the expression `False and (not False) or False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. Here, we have `(not False)`, which evaluates to `True` because the NOT operator negates the value of `False`.\n\n2. **AND**: Now, substitute the result from the parentheses back into the expression. We have `False and True or False`. The AND operation is evaluated next. `False and True` evaluates to `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n\n3. **OR**: Finally, we evaluate the OR operation. We have `False or False`, which evaluates to `False` because at least one operand needs to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = False and (not False) or False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual evaluation of the expression. The expression `False and (not False) or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
