    "To solve the expression `True or (True or not True)`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated value back into the expression**:\n   - The expression becomes `True or (True or False)`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - `True or False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Substitute the evaluated value back into the expression**:\n   - The expression becomes `True or True`.\n\n5. **Evaluate the final expression**:\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this evaluation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Python code to evaluate the expression\nresult = True or (True or not True)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>",
