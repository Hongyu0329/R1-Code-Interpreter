    "To solve the expression `(not False and False and False)`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **not False**: The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **True and False**: The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `True and False` is `False`.\n\n3. **False and False**: Again, using the `and` operator, since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `(not False and False and False)` evaluates to `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = (not False and False and False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression `(not False and False and False)` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
