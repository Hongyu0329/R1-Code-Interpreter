    "To solve the logical expression `False or True or False and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Evaluate `False and True`: According to the precedence, `and` is evaluated before `or`. So, `False and True` is `False`.\n3. Now, the expression is `False or True or False`.\n4. Evaluate `False or True`: This becomes `True`.\n5. Finally, evaluate `True or False`: This remains `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = False or True or False and not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
