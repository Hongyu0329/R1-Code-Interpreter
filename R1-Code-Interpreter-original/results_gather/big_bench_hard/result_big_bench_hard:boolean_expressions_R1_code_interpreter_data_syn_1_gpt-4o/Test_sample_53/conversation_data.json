    "To solve the expression `not False and not False and not False`, we need to evaluate each part of the expression step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding `not False`:** \n   - The `not` operator in Python is a logical negation operator. It inverts the boolean value of the operand.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True` because the negation of `False` is `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluating the entire expression:**\n   - The expression is `not False and not False and not False`.\n   - Since each `not False` evaluates to `True`, the expression becomes `True and True and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if all operands are `True`. Therefore, `True and True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTo confirm this, we can write a simple Python script to evaluate the expression.\n\n```python\nresult = not False and not False and not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression `not False and not False and not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
