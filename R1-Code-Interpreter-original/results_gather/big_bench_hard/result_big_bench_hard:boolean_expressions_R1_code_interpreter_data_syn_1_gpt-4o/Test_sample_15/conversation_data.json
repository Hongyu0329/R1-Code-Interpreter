    "To solve the expression `not not not (True and False)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - `True and False` evaluates to `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the `and` operator to return `True`.\n\n2. **Apply the first `not` operator**:\n   - `not (False)` evaluates to `True` because `not` inverts the boolean value.\n\n3. **Apply the second `not` operator**:\n   - `not (True)` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Apply the third `not` operator**:\n   - `not (False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `not not not (True and False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not not not (True and False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
