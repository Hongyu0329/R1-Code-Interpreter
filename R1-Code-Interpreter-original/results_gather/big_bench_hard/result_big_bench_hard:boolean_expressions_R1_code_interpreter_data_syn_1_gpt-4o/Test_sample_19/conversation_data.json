    "To solve the expression `False or (False and not False)`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression first**: \n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `and` operation**:\n   - `False and True` evaluates to `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the `and` operation to result in `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operation**:\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False` because at least one operand needs to be `True` for the `or` operation to result in `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = False or (False and not False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
