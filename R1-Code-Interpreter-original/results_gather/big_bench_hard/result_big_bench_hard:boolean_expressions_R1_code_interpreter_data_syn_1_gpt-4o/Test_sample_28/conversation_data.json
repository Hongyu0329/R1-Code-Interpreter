    "To solve the expression `True and not True or False or True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not True`:**  \n   `not True` is `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute back into the expression:**  \n   The expression becomes `True and False or False or True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `True and False`:**  \n   `True and False` is `False`.\n\n4. **Substitute back into the expression:**  \n   The expression becomes `False or False or True`.\n\n5. **Evaluate `False or False`:**  \n   `False or False` is `False`.\n\n6. **Substitute back into the expression:**  \n   The expression becomes `False or True`.\n\n7. **Evaluate `False or True`:**  \n   `False or True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = True and not True or False or True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to confirm the result.",
