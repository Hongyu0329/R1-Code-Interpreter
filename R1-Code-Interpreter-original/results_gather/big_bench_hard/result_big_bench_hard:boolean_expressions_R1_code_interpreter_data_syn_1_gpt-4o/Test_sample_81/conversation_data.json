    "To solve the expression `not not not False or False and False is`, we need to understand the order of operations and the behavior of logical operators in Python.\n\n1. **Order of Operations**: In Python, the order of operations for logical operators is:\n   - `not` has the highest precedence.\n   - `and` has the next highest precedence.\n   - `or` has the lowest precedence.\n\n2. **Evaluation of the Expression**:\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - `not not False` evaluates to `False` (since `not True` is `False`).\n   - `not not not False` evaluates to `True` (since `not False` is `True`).\n\n3. **Combining with `or` and `and`**:\n   - The expression becomes `True or False and False`.\n   - According to precedence, `False and False` is evaluated first, which results in `False`.\n   - Then, `True or False` is evaluated, which results in `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\nresult = not not not False or False and False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning. The expression `not not not False or False and False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    not not not False or False and False is\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
