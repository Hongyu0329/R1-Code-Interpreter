    "To solve the expression `not True or not False and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the `not` operators:\n   - `not True` becomes `False`\n   - `not False` becomes `True`\n   - `not False` becomes `True`\n\n2. Substitute these values back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `False or True and True`\n\n3. Evaluate the `and` operator:\n   - `True and True` becomes `True`\n\n4. Substitute this value back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `False or True`\n\n5. Evaluate the `or` operator:\n   - `False or True` becomes `True`\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not True or not False and not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual evaluation. The expression `not True or not False and not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
