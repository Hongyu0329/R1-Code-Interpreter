    "To solve the logical expression `not True and True and True or False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not True`: This becomes `False`.\n2. Now the expression is `False and True and True or False`.\n3. Evaluate `False and True`: This becomes `False`.\n4. Now the expression is `False and True or False`.\n5. Evaluate `False and True`: This becomes `False`.\n6. Now the expression is `False or False`.\n7. Evaluate `False or False`: This becomes `False`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = not True and True and True or False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result.",
