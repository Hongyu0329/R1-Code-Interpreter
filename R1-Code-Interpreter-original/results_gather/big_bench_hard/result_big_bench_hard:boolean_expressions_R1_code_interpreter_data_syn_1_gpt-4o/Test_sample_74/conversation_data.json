    "To solve the expression `(not False or True) and True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of boolean logic in Python.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:** \n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. Since `False` is inverted, it becomes `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `True or True`:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Here, both operands are `True`, so the result is `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `True and True`:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since both are `True`, the result is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = (not False or True) and True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is `True`. This confirms our step-by-step evaluation of the expression.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
