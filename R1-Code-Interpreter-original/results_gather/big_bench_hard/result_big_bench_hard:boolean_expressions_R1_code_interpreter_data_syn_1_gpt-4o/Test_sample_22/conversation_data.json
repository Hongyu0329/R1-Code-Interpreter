    "To solve the expression `not False or (True) and True`, we need to understand the order of operations for logical operators in Python. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nGiven this, we will evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True` because `not` negates the boolean value.\n2. Evaluate `(True) and True`: This remains `True` because both operands are `True`.\n3. Evaluate `True or True`: This results in `True` because at least one operand is `True`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = not False or (True) and True\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our step-by-step evaluation of the expression. The final result of the expression `not False or (True) and True` is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
