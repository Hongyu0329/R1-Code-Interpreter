    "To determine whether Frank T. intentionally shot his neighbor in the body, we need to consider the context and details provided in the scenario:\n\n1. **Ongoing Dispute**: Frank T. had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land. This indicates a possible motive or reason for hostility.\n\n2. **Expert Marksman**: Frank T. is described as an expert marksman. This suggests that he has the skill and ability to accurately hit a target, which implies that if he aimed at his neighbor's body, it was likely intentional.\n\n3. **Action Taken**: Frank T. decided to shoot his neighbor and directly hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. The use of the word \"decided\" implies a conscious choice or intention to perform the act.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that Frank T. intentionally shot his neighbor in the body. The combination of motive (dispute), capability (expert marksman), and the deliberate action (deciding to shoot) strongly supports the conclusion of intentionality.\n\nTherefore, the typical answer to the question of whether Frank T. intentionally shot his neighbor in the body would be:\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes"
