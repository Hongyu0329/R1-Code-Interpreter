  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Jane logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Lauren decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether Jane caused the computer to crash, we need to analyze the situation based on the given information:\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: \n   - The computer crashes if two people are logged on at the same time.\n   - The company policy is that Jane uses the computer in the morning and Lauren in the afternoon.\n   - Jane logged on at 9:00 am, which is within her permitted time.\n   - Lauren disobeyed the policy and logged on at 9:00 am, causing both to be logged on simultaneously.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - Causation typically involves an action that directly leads to an effect.\n   - Jane's action of logging on was within the policy and expected behavior.\n   - The crash occurs due to the simultaneous login of both Jane and Lauren.\n   - Lauren's action of logging on against the policy is the direct cause of the crash.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Jane's action alone would not have caused the crash; it was the combination of both logging on that led to the crash.\n   - Since Jane was following the policy, her action is not the cause of the crash.\n   - Lauren's action of logging on when she was not supposed to is the direct cause.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to whether Jane caused the computer to crash is:\n\n<<<answer>>>No"
