  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in the factory. She works in the maintenance department where she monitors the stability of all machines. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee in the factory. She works in the human resources department where she monitors the salaries of all employees. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. On June 1st, Janet forgot to put oil into the machine. The machine broke down. Did the machine break down because Kate did not put oil in the machine?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether the machine broke down because Kate did not put oil in the machine, we need to analyze the causal relationship and responsibilities described in the scenario.\n\n1. **Janet's Responsibility**: Janet is responsible for maintaining the machines, including putting oil in them. It is explicitly stated that it is her responsibility to put oil into the machines.\n\n2. **Kate's Role**: Although Kate knows how to grease and oil the machines, it is not her responsibility to do so. Her primary role is in the human resources department, focusing on monitoring salaries.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**: The machine broke down because Janet forgot to put oil in it. Since it is Janet's responsibility to maintain the machines, her failure to do so is the direct cause of the breakdown.\n\n4. **Kate's Non-Responsibility**: Since it is not Kate's responsibility to oil the machines, her inaction cannot be considered a cause of the breakdown. The breakdown is not due to Kate's failure to act, as she was not expected to perform this task.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the machine did not break down because Kate did not put oil in the machine. The breakdown occurred due to Janet's oversight.\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
