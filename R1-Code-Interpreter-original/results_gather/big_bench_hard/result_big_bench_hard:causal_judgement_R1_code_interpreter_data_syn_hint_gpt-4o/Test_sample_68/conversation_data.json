    "To determine whether Claire caused the computer crash, we need to analyze the situation based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: \n   - Claire's parents bought her an old computer.\n   - Claire uses the computer for schoolwork.\n   - Daniel, her brother, sometimes logs on to play games.\n   - Claire warned Daniel that if both are logged on simultaneously, the computer will crash.\n\n2. **Event Sequence**:\n   - Both Claire and Daniel logged on to the computer at the same time.\n   - The computer crashed.\n\n3. **Repairman's Observation**:\n   - The repairman noted that the computer crashes only if two people are logged on simultaneously.\n\n4. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - The crash occurred because both Claire and Daniel were logged on at the same time.\n   - Claire's action of logging on contributed to the crash, but it was the simultaneous action of both Claire and Daniel that directly caused the crash.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While Claire's action was part of the condition that led to the crash, it was not solely her action that caused it. The crash was due to both Claire and Daniel being logged on simultaneously. Therefore, Claire alone did not cause the crash.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to whether Claire caused the computer crash is:\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
