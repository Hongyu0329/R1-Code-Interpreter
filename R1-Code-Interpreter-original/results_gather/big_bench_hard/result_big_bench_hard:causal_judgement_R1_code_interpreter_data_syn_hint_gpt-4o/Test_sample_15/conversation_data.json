  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Alice also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Zoe caused the empty email to be sent, we need to analyze the situation based on the concept of causation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: \n   - The company has a policy that Alice logs in during the morning and Zoe in the afternoon.\n   - If two people log in simultaneously, an empty email is sent to a non-existent address.\n   - On the day in question, Zoe logs in at 9 am, violating the policy, and Alice also logs in at 9 am.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Counterfactual Test**: This test asks whether the event (empty email being sent) would have occurred if Zoe had not logged in. If Zoe had not logged in, only Alice would have been logged in, and the email would not have been sent. Therefore, Zoe's action is a necessary condition for the email being sent.\n   - **Policy Violation**: Zoe violated the company policy by logging in during the morning, which directly contributed to the simultaneous login situation.\n   - **Joint Responsibility**: While both Alice and Zoe logged in, Zoe's action was against the policy, making her action a direct cause of the email being sent.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the counterfactual test and the fact that Zoe's action was a necessary condition for the email being sent, it can be concluded that Zoe did cause the empty email to be sent.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
