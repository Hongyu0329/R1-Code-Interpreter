It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time.

    "To determine whether Alex won the game because of the coin flip, we need to analyze the conditions for winning:\n\n1. Alex will win the game if:\n   - The total of his dice roll is greater than 11.\n   - The coin comes up heads.\n\n2. The probability of the coin coming up heads is 50%, and the probability of rolling greater than 11 is very low.\n\n3. In this scenario, Alex rolled a 12 (which is greater than 11) and the coin came up heads.\n\nNow, let's consider the causation:\n\n- The coin flip is a necessary condition for Alex to win because, without the coin coming up heads, he would not win regardless of the dice roll.\n- The dice roll is also a necessary condition because, without rolling greater than 11, he would not win regardless of the coin flip.\n\nSince both conditions are necessary for Alex to win, the coin flip is indeed a part of the causal chain that led to his victory. However, the question asks if Alex won \"because of the coin flip.\" In this context, \"because of\" implies a primary or significant cause.\n\nGiven that both conditions are equally necessary, neither the coin flip nor the dice roll can be considered the sole or primary cause of the win. Therefore, while the coin flip is a necessary condition, it is not the sole reason Alex won.\n\nThus, the typical answer to whether Alex won because of the coin flip would be:\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
