  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nMr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the crime life cause Mr. Wallace's death?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the crime life caused Mr. Wallace's death, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the potential causes of his death.\n\n1. **Poisoning Incident**: Mr. Vincent poisoned Mr. Wallace's drink with a lethal dose of poison. The poison was expected to take about an hour to kill Mr. Wallace, with a variance of 10 minutes depending on his body weight. This means that the poison would have started affecting him approximately 30 minutes after consumption and could have been fatal within an hour.\n\n2. **Car Accident**: Mr. Wallace was involved in a car accident caused by Mr. Bruce, who deliberately hit his car, causing it to fall into a ravine and explode. The coroner's report indicated that Mr. Wallace received fatal burns from the car explosion.\n\n3. **Timing and Causation**: The key question is whether Mr. Wallace would have died from the poison if the car accident had not occurred. The coroner's report found a lethal dose of poison in his blood, but the immediate cause of death was the fatal burns from the explosion.\n\n4. **Crime Life Influence**: Both the poisoning and the car accident were direct results of Mr. Wallace's involvement in organized crime. Mr. Vincent and Mr. Bruce were both associates within the crime scene, and their actions were motivated by the dynamics of that environment.\n\nGiven these points, the crime life directly led to both the poisoning and the car accident, which were both potential causes of Mr. Wallace's death. The immediate cause of death was the car explosion, but the poisoning was also a significant factor that could have led to his death if the accident had not occurred.\n\nTherefore, considering the influence of the crime life on both events, it can be concluded that the crime life did cause Mr. Wallace's death.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
