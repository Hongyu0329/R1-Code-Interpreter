  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Zoe caused the empty email to be sent, we need to consider the conditions under which the email is sent. The problem states that an empty email is sent if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time. \n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Condition for Email Sending**: The email is sent when two people are logged in simultaneously.\n2. **Alice's Action**: Alice logs in at 9 am.\n3. **Zoe's Action**: Zoe also logs in at 9 am.\n4. **Simultaneous Login**: Since both Alice and Zoe are logged in at the same time (9 am), the condition for sending the email is met.\n5. **Causation**: For causation, we need to determine if Zoe's action was necessary for the email to be sent. If Zoe had not logged in, only Alice would have been logged in, and the email would not have been sent. Therefore, Zoe's login was a necessary condition for the email to be sent.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Zoe's action of logging in at the same time as Alice directly contributed to the condition that caused the email to be sent. Therefore, Zoe did cause the email to be sent.\n\nThe typical person would likely conclude that Zoe's action was indeed a cause of the email being sent because her login was necessary to meet the condition of two simultaneous logins.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
