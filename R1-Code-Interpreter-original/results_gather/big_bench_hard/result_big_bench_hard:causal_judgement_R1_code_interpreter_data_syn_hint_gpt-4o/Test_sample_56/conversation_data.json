  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down, we need to consider the concept of causation in this context. Causation implies that one event (or lack of an event) directly leads to another event. In this scenario, Janet's responsibility is to put oil in the machines, and she failed to do so. Kate, although capable, is not responsible for this task.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Responsibility**: Janet is responsible for oiling the machines. Her failure to do so means she did not fulfill her duty.\n\n2. **Capability vs. Responsibility**: While Kate is capable of oiling the machines, it is not her responsibility. Therefore, her inaction does not contribute to the causation in the same way Janet's does.\n\n3. **Direct Consequence**: The machine broke down a few days after Janet failed to oil it. This suggests a direct link between the lack of oiling and the machine's breakdown.\n\n4. **Causation**: Since Janet's action (or inaction) directly led to the machine not being oiled, and this lack of oiling is a plausible reason for the machine's breakdown, it can be said that Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the typical answer would be:\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes"
