  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down, we need to analyze the situation based on the concept of causation.\n\n1. **Responsibility and Knowledge**: Janet is responsible for oiling the machines, and she knows how to do it. Kate also knows how to oil the machines but is not responsible for doing so if Janet fails to.\n\n2. **Event Sequence**: Janet forgot to put oil in the machine, and Kate did not notice this and did not oil the machine either. The machine broke down a few days later.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Direct Cause**: Janet's failure to oil the machine is a direct cause of the machine breaking down because it was her responsibility, and the lack of oil likely led to the breakdown.\n   - **Responsibility**: Since it was Janet's responsibility to oil the machine, her failure to do so is directly linked to the machine's malfunction.\n   - **Intervention**: Kate's lack of intervention does not change the causation because she was not responsible for oiling the machine in Janet's absence.\n\nBased on this analysis, Janet not putting oil in the machine is indeed the cause of the machine breaking down. The breakdown is a direct consequence of her not fulfilling her responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes"
