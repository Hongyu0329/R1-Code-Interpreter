    "To determine whether the machine broke down because Kate did not put oil in the machine, we need to analyze the causal chain of events and responsibilities.\n\n1. **Janet's Responsibility**: Janet is primarily responsible for putting oil into the machines. On June 1st, she forgot to do so.\n\n2. **Kate's Responsibility**: Kate is responsible for putting oil in the machines only if Janet does not do it. Since Janet forgot, it became Kate's responsibility to ensure the machines were oiled.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**: The machine broke down because it was not oiled. The primary cause of the breakdown is the lack of oiling. Since Janet forgot to oil the machine, the responsibility shifted to Kate. Kate did not fulfill this responsibility, leading to the breakdown.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The machine broke down because neither Janet nor Kate put oil in the machine. However, since the question specifically asks if the breakdown was because Kate did not put oil in the machine, we can conclude that Kate's inaction was a direct cause of the breakdown after Janet's initial failure.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
