  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Alice caused the empty email to be sent, we need to analyze the situation based on the concept of causation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: \n   - The company has a policy that Alice logs in during the morning and Zoe logs in during the afternoon.\n   - If two people are logged in simultaneously, an empty email is sent to a non-existent address.\n   - Zoe violated the policy by logging in at 9 am.\n   - Alice logged in at 9:30 am, following the policy, while Zoe was already logged in.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Cause**: For Alice to be considered the cause of the email being sent, her action (logging in) must be a necessary condition for the email to be sent.\n   - **Counterfactual Test**: If Alice had not logged in, would the email still have been sent? The answer is no, because the email is only sent when two people are logged in simultaneously. Therefore, Alice's action was necessary for the email to be sent.\n   - **Policy Violation**: Although Zoe violated the policy, the causation question focuses on whether Alice's action directly led to the email being sent.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Alice's action of logging in was a necessary condition for the email to be sent, as it required two people to be logged in simultaneously.\n   - Therefore, in terms of causation, Alice did cause the email to be sent, even though she was following the policy.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the typical answer to the question of whether Alice caused the email to be sent is:\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
