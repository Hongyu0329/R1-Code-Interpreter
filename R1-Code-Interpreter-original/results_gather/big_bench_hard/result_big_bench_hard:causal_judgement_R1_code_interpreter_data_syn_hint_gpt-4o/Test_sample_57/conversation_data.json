  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nDrew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers at a small, local coffee shop. Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen all usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, as usual, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, Oliver ordered coffee, and Jen also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day. Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday caused the coffee shop to make a profit, we need to consider the concept of causation. Causation implies that an event (Drew ordering coffee) directly leads to an outcome (the coffee shop making a profit).\n\nIn this scenario, the coffee shop will make a profit if at least one person orders coffee. On Tuesday, not only did Drew order coffee, but Kylie, Oliver, and Jen also ordered coffee. Therefore, the condition for the coffee shop to make a profit (at least one person ordering coffee) was satisfied by multiple people, not just Drew.\n\nFor Drew's action to be the cause of the profit, it would need to be the sole reason the condition was met. However, since multiple people ordered coffee, the profit was not solely dependent on Drew's order. Even if Drew had not ordered coffee, the shop would still have made a profit due to the other orders.\n\nTherefore, Drew ordering coffee was not the cause of the coffee shop making a profit, as the profit would have occurred regardless of his action.\n\n<<<answer>>>No"
