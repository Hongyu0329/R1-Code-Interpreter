  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLong ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether John's job caused his premature death, we need to consider the sequence of events and the causal relationships involved.\n\n1. **Exposure to Asbestos**: John worked in a part of the plastics division that was exposed to asbestos, a known carcinogen. This exposure led to him developing a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer.\n\n2. **Lung Cancer Diagnosis**: The cancer specialists confirmed that John's lung cancer was untreatable and that he was certain to die from it soon, with an estimated life expectancy of no more than 2 months.\n\n3. **Accidental Medication Error**: While in the hospital, John was accidentally given the wrong medication, to which he was allergic. This caused him to go into shock and experience cardiac arrest, leading to his death.\n\nNow, let's analyze the causation:\n\n- **Direct Cause of Death**: The immediate cause of John's death was the cardiac arrest induced by the allergic reaction to the wrong medication administered by the nurse.\n\n- **Underlying Health Condition**: John's lung cancer, caused by asbestos exposure at his job, was a critical underlying health condition that significantly reduced his life expectancy.\n\n- **Causation Analysis**: While John's job exposed him to asbestos, leading to lung cancer, the direct cause of his death was the medication error. The job did not directly cause the cardiac arrest, which was the immediate cause of death.\n\nTherefore, while John's job contributed to his poor health condition, it was not the direct cause of his premature death. The direct cause was the medication error.\n\n<<<answer>>>No"
