  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLong ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did cancer cause John's premature death?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether cancer caused John's premature death, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the causal relationships involved.\n\n1. **John's Health Condition**: John had a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer, which was expected to lead to his death within two months. This indicates that cancer was a significant factor in his overall health decline and impending death.\n\n2. **Immediate Cause of Death**: John died from cardiac arrest caused by an allergic reaction to a medication administered by mistake. This was an acute event that directly led to his death.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Proximate Cause**: The immediate cause of John's death was the cardiac arrest triggered by the allergic reaction to the medication. This is the direct cause of death.\n   - **Underlying Condition**: While cancer was a severe underlying condition that would have led to his death soon, it was not the direct cause of the cardiac arrest.\n\nIn legal and medical contexts, the cause of death is often attributed to the immediate event that led to the cessation of life functions, unless the underlying condition directly contributed to that event. In this case, the cardiac arrest was directly caused by the medication error, not by the cancer itself.\n\nTherefore, while cancer was a significant factor in John's overall health and life expectancy, it was not the direct cause of his premature death in this specific incident.\n\n<<<answer>>>No"
