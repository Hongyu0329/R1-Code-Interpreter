  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Janet noticed that she did not put oil in the machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down, we need to consider the concept of causation in this context. Causation typically involves a direct link between an action (or inaction) and an outcome. In this scenario, Janet has the responsibility to oil the machines, and she forgot to do so. This inaction directly led to the machine not being oiled, which is a necessary maintenance task to prevent breakdowns.\n\nKate, although knowledgeable about the process, does not have the responsibility to oil the machines if Janet fails to do so. Therefore, Kate's inaction is not relevant to the causation question because it was not her duty to oil the machine.\n\nGiven that Janet's failure to oil the machine directly led to the machine not receiving necessary maintenance, and this lack of maintenance is what caused the machine to break down, we can conclude that Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes"
