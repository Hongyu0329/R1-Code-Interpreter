  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nProf. Smith works at a large university. At this university, in order to get new computers from the university, faculty like Prof. Smith must send an application to two administrative committees, the IT committee and the department budget committee. Prof. Smith will be able to get her new computers if the IT committee approves her application or the department budget committee approves her application. Only one of the committees needs to approve her application for her to get the new computers. The IT committee almost always approves these applications. The department budget committee almost never approves these applications. The budget committee is notorious for turning down almost every application they receive. Prof. Smith sends in her applications. Each committee meets independently and they decide without talking to each other, but their meetings are scheduled for the exact same time. The IT committee approves her application, and surprisingly, the department budget committee approves her application. So, Prof. Smith got her new computers. Does the department budget committee cause the approval of Prof. Smith's application?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether the department budget committee caused the approval of Prof. Smith's application, we need to consider the conditions under which causation is typically assessed. In this scenario, Prof. Smith's application was approved by both the IT committee and the department budget committee. However, only one committee's approval was necessary for her to get the new computers.\n\nThe IT committee almost always approves applications, which suggests that their approval was highly likely. On the other hand, the department budget committee almost never approves applications, making their approval an unusual event.\n\nIn terms of causation, we often look at whether an event (in this case, the department budget committee's approval) was necessary or sufficient for the outcome (Prof. Smith getting the new computers). Since the IT committee's approval alone was sufficient for Prof. Smith to get the computers, the department budget committee's approval was not necessary for the outcome.\n\nTherefore, even though the department budget committee approved the application, their approval did not cause the outcome because the IT committee's approval was already sufficient to ensure that Prof. Smith would get the new computers.\n\nThus, the typical answer to whether the department budget committee caused the approval of Prof. Smith's application would be:\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
