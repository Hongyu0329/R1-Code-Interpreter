    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps and determine if the final position is the same as the starting point.\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 10 steps forward: position = 0 + 10 = 10.\n3. Take 4 steps forward: position = 10 + 4 = 14.\n4. Take 7 steps backward: position = 14 - 7 = 7.\n5. Take 7 steps backward: position = 7 - 7 = 0.\n\nAfter performing all the steps, the final position is 0, which is the same as the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
