    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 3 steps**: You move 3 steps forward in the initial direction.\n2. **Turn left**: You change your direction 90 degrees to the left.\n3. **Turn left**: You change your direction another 90 degrees to the left, which means you are now facing the opposite direction from the initial one.\n4. **Turn around**: You turn 180 degrees, which means you are now facing the initial direction again.\n5. **Take 5 steps**: You move 5 steps forward in the initial direction.\n6. **Turn around**: You turn 180 degrees, which means you are now facing the opposite direction from the initial one.\n7. **Take 5 steps**: You move 5 steps forward in the opposite direction.\n\nLet's analyze the net movement:\n\n- Initially, you take 3 steps forward.\n- After turning around and taking 5 steps, you have moved 2 steps forward from the starting point (5 steps forward minus 3 steps backward).\n- After turning around again and taking 5 steps, you move back to the starting point (2 steps backward from the 2 steps forward position).\n\nTherefore, you do return to the starting point.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
