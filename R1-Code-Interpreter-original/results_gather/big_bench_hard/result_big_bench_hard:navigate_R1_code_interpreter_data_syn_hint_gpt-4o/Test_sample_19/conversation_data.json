  "response_list": [
    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the steps and directions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at the origin (0, 0) on a coordinate plane, facing north (positive y-direction).\n\n2. **Take 8 steps**: Move 8 steps north. New position: (0, 8).\n\n3. **Turn left**: Now facing west (negative x-direction).\n\n4. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 steps west. New position: (-9, 8).\n\n5. **Take 7 steps**: Continue moving west. New position: (-16, 8).\n\n6. **Turn around**: Now facing east (positive x-direction).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the final position. The starting point was (0, 0), and the final position is (-16, 8). Since the final position is not the same as the starting point, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
