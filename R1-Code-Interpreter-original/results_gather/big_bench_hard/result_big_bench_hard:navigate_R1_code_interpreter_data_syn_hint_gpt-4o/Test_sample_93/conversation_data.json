    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements and turns step by step. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Take 7 steps**: Move 7 steps north. New position: (0, 7).\n\n3. **Turn around**: Now facing south.\n\n4. **Take 10 steps**: Move 10 steps south. New position: (0, -3).\n\n5. **Take 2 steps**: Move 2 steps south. New position: (0, -5).\n\n6. **Turn around**: Now facing north.\n\n7. **Take 5 steps**: Move 5 steps north. New position: (0, 0).\n\n8. **Turn left**: Now facing west.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, the final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
