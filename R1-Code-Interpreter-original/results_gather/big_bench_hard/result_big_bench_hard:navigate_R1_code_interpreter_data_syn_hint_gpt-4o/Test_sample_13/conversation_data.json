    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements step by step and determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: (0, 0)\n\n2. **Take 5 steps backward**: \n   - Assuming backward means moving in the negative y-direction, we move from (0, 0) to (0, -5).\n\n3. **Take 2 steps left**: \n   - Assuming left means moving in the negative x-direction, we move from (0, -5) to (-2, -5).\n\n4. **Take 5 steps right**: \n   - Assuming right means moving in the positive x-direction, we move from (-2, -5) to (3, -5).\n\n5. **Take 3 steps left**: \n   - Moving left again in the negative x-direction, we move from (3, -5) to (0, -5).\n\n6. **Take 5 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward again in the negative y-direction, we move from (0, -5) to (0, -10).\n\n7. **Take 10 steps forward**: \n   - Assuming forward means moving in the positive y-direction, we move from (0, -10) to (0, 0).\n\nAfter executing all these movements, we end up at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
