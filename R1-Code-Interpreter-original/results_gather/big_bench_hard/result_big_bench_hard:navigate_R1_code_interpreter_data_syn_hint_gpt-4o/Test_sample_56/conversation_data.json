    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the steps and turns to determine if we return to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume we start at the origin (0, 0) facing north.\n2. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 steps north. New position: (0, 9).\n3. **Turn left**: Now facing west.\n4. **Turn left**: Now facing south.\n5. **Take 5 steps**: Move 5 steps south. New position: (0, 4).\n6. **Take 4 steps**: Move 4 steps south. New position: (0, 0).\n7. **Turn left**: Now facing east.\n8. **Turn left**: Now facing north.\n\nAfter following these steps, we end up at the starting point (0, 0) and are facing the same direction (north) as we started.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
