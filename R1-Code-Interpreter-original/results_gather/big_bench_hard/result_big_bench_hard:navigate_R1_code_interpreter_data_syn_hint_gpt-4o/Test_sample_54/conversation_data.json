    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the instructions and determine if they lead back to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Turn Right**: Facing east.\n\n3. **Take 3 Steps**: Move 3 steps east to (3, 0).\n\n4. **Turn Around**: Now facing west.\n\n5. **Take 3 Steps**: Move 3 steps west back to (0, 0).\n\n6. **Turn Left**: Now facing south.\n\nThe final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
