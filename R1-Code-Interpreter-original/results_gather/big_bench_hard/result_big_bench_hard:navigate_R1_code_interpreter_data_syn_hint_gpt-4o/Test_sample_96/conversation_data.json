    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the steps and turns described in the instructions. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin at a certain point, which we'll call the origin (0, 0) on a grid. We assume facing north initially.\n\n2. **Take 6 steps**: Moving north, we take 6 steps. This means we move from (0, 0) to (0, 6).\n\n3. **Turn right**: Turning right from north means we now face east.\n\n4. **Turn right**: Turning right again from east means we now face south.\n\n5. **Take 7 steps**: Moving south, we take 7 steps. This means we move from (0, 6) to (0, -1).\n\n6. **Turn around**: Turning around from south means we now face north.\n\n7. **Take 1 step**: Moving north, we take 1 step. This means we move from (0, -1) to (0, 0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, we end up at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
