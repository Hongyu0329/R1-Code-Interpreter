    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps based on the given instructions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the starting point.\n2. Take 9 steps backward.\n3. Take 2 steps forward.\n4. Take 1 step backward.\n5. Take 8 steps forward.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Starting point: 0\n- 9 steps backward: 0 - 9 = -9\n- 2 steps forward: -9 + 2 = -7\n- 1 step backward: -7 - 1 = -8\n- 8 steps forward: -8 + 8 = 0\n\nAfter following all the instructions, we end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes,\" you return to the starting point.\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
