    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the directions and steps taken. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. \"Always face forward.\" - This means we start facing a certain direction, which we'll assume is \"North\" for simplicity.\n\n2. \"Take 6 steps left.\" - If facing North, turning left means facing West. So, we take 6 steps West.\n\n3. \"Take 3 steps backward.\" - If facing West, moving backward means moving East. So, we take 3 steps East.\n\n4. \"Take 3 steps left.\" - If facing West, turning left again means facing South. So, we take 3 steps South.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- From the starting point, we moved 6 steps West, then 3 steps East, resulting in a net movement of 3 steps West.\n- Finally, we moved 3 steps South.\n\nThe final position is 3 steps West and 3 steps South from the starting point. Therefore, we do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is \"No.\"\n\n<<<answer>>>"
