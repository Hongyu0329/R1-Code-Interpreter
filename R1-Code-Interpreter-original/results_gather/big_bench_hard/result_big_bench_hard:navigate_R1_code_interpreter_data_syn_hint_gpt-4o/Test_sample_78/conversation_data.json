    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the final position relative to the starting point after following the given instructions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at position (0, 0) on a 2D plane, where the x-axis represents the horizontal direction (right/left) and the y-axis represents the vertical direction (forward/backward).\n\n2. **Take 5 steps right**: This means moving 5 units along the x-axis in the positive direction. New position: (5, 0).\n\n3. **Take 8 steps backward**: This means moving 8 units along the y-axis in the negative direction. New position: (5, -8).\n\n4. **Take 1 step right**: This means moving 1 unit along the x-axis in the positive direction. New position: (6, -8).\n\n5. **Take 7 steps backward**: This means moving 7 units along the y-axis in the negative direction. New position: (6, -15).\n\nNow, we need to determine if this final position (6, -15) is the same as the starting point (0, 0).\n\nSince (6, -15) is not equal to (0, 0), the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
