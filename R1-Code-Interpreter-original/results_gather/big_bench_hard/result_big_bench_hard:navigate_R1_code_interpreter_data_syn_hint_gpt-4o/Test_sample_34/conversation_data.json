    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements step by step. Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) on a 2D plane, where moving \"forward\" increases the y-coordinate, and turning right changes the direction clockwise (from north to east, south, west, and back to north).\n\n1. Start at (0, 0), facing north.\n2. Take 7 steps north: (0, 7).\n3. Take 8 steps north: (0, 15).\n4. Turn right: now facing east.\n5. Turn right: now facing south.\n6. Take 1 step south: (0, 14).\n7. Take 7 steps south: (0, 7).\n8. Take 6 steps south: (0, 1).\n9. Take 1 step south: (0, 0).\n\nAfter these movements, you return to the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
