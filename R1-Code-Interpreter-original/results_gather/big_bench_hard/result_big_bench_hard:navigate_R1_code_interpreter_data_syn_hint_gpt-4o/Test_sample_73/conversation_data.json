    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the instructions given will return us to the starting point. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 4 steps forward: This moves us to position 4.\n3. Take 2 steps backward: This moves us to position 2 (4 - 2 = 2).\n4. Take 10 steps backward: This moves us to position -8 (2 - 10 = -8).\n\nNow, we need to check if the final position (-8) is the same as the starting position (0). Since -8 is not equal to 0, the answer is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'No'>>>"
