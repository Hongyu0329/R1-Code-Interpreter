    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and turns to determine if the final position is the same as the starting point. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing North.\n\n2. **Turn left**: Facing West.\n\n3. **Turn left**: Facing South.\n\n4. **Take 10 steps**: Move 10 steps South. New position: (0, -10).\n\n5. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps South. New position: (0, -16).\n\n6. **Turn left**: Facing East.\n\n7. **Take 3 steps**: Move 3 steps East. New position: (3, -16).\n\n8. **Take 3 steps**: Move 3 steps East. New position: (6, -16).\n\nNow, let's determine if the final position (6, -16) is the same as the starting point (0, 0).\n\nClearly, the final position is not the same as the starting point. Therefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>No"
