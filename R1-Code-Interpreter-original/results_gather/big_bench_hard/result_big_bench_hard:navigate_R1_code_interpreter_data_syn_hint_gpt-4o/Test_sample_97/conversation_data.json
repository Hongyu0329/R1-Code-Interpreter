    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement based on the given instructions and determine if we return to the starting point. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin (0, 0).\n\n2. **Take 9 steps right**: This means moving 9 units in the positive x-direction. New position: (9, 0).\n\n3. **Take 6 steps right**: Move 6 more units in the positive x-direction. New position: (15, 0).\n\n4. **Take 10 steps backward**: This means moving 10 units in the negative y-direction. New position: (15, -10).\n\n5. **Take 9 steps left**: Move 9 units in the negative x-direction. New position: (6, -10).\n\n6. **Take 4 steps left**: Move 4 more units in the negative x-direction. New position: (2, -10).\n\nNow, let's determine if the final position (2, -10) is the same as the starting position (0, 0). Clearly, they are not the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
