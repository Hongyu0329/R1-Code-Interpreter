    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps forward and backward to determine if the final position is the starting point.\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 6 steps forward: position = 0 + 6 = 6.\n3. Take 7 steps backward: position = 6 - 7 = -1.\n4. Take 7 steps backward again: position = -1 - 7 = -8.\n5. Take 8 steps forward: position = -8 + 8 = 0.\n\nAfter performing all the steps, the final position is 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
