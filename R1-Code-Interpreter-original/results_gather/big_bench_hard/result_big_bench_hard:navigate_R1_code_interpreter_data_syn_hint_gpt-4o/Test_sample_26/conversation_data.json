    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement based on the given instructions and determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at position 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **Take 10 steps**: Move 10 steps forward. Current position = 0 + 10 = 10.\n\n3. **Turn around**: This means we change direction. If we were moving forward, we now move backward.\n\n4. **Take 4 steps**: Move 4 steps backward. Current position = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\n5. **Take 6 steps**: Continue moving backward. Current position = 6 - 6 = 0.\n\n6. **Turn around**: Change direction again. However, since there are no more steps to take, this doesn't affect the final position.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, we end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
