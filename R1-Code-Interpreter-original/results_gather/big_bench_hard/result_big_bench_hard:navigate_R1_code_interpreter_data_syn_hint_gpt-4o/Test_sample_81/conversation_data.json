    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements step by step and determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Movements**:\n   - Take 8 steps forward: This means moving 8 steps in the positive y-direction. New position: (0, 8).\n   - Take 9 steps right: This means moving 9 steps in the positive x-direction. New position: (9, 8).\n   - Take 2 steps forward: This means moving 2 steps in the positive y-direction. New position: (9, 10).\n   - Take 10 steps backward: This means moving 10 steps in the negative y-direction. New position: (9, 0).\n   - Take 9 steps left: This means moving 9 steps in the negative x-direction. New position: (0, 0).\n\n3. **Final Position**: After all the movements, the final position is (0, 0), which is the same as the starting point.\n\nSince the final position is the same as the starting point, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
