    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movements described and determine if they result in returning to the starting point.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Movement Analysis**:\n   - \"Always face forward\": This implies that the initial direction is forward, which we can assume to be along the positive y-axis.\n   - \"Take 4 steps forward\": This moves the position from (0, 0) to (0, 4).\n   - \"Take 5 steps right\": Facing forward (positive y-axis), right would be along the positive x-axis. This moves the position from (0, 4) to (5, 4).\n   - \"Take 7 steps left\": Facing forward (positive y-axis), left would be along the negative x-axis. This moves the position from (5, 4) to (-2, 4).\n\n3. **Final Position**: After all movements, the final position is (-2, 4).\n\n4. **Comparison with Starting Point**: The starting point was (0, 0), and the final position is (-2, 4). Since these coordinates are different, the movements do not return to the starting point.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>No"
