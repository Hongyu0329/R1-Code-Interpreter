    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and determine if the final position is the same as the starting point. Let's break down the movements:\n\n1. Start at the origin point (0, 0).\n2. Take 9 steps forward: This means moving 9 steps in the positive y-direction. New position: (0, 9).\n3. Take 7 steps left: This means moving 7 steps in the negative x-direction. New position: (-7, 9).\n4. Take 5 steps backward: This means moving 5 steps in the negative y-direction. New position: (-7, 4).\n5. Take 4 steps right: This means moving 4 steps in the positive x-direction. New position: (-3, 4).\n6. Take 3 steps right: This means moving 3 steps in the positive x-direction. New position: (0, 4).\n7. Take 4 steps backward: This means moving 4 steps in the negative y-direction. New position: (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's check if the final position is the same as the starting point.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\nmovements = [\n    (0, 9),   # 9 steps forward\n    (-7, 0),  # 7 steps left\n    (0, -5),  # 5 steps backward\n    (4, 0),   # 4 steps right\n    (3, 0),   # 3 steps right\n    (0, -4)   # 4 steps backward\n]\n\n# Apply movements\nfor dx, dy in movements:\n    x += dx\n    y += dy\n\n# Check if back to starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the final position is indeed the same as the starting point. The output `True` confirms that after following all the given instructions, you return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
