    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Take 4 steps**: Assume you start at the origin (0,0) and move in a positive direction (e.g., north or east). Let's say you move north, so your position is now (0,4).\n\n2. **Take 2 steps**: Continue in the same direction. Your position is now (0,6).\n\n3. **Turn around**: This means you reverse your direction. If you were moving north, you now move south.\n\n4. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps in the new direction (south). Your position changes from (0,6) to (0,0).\n\nAfter these steps, you are back at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
