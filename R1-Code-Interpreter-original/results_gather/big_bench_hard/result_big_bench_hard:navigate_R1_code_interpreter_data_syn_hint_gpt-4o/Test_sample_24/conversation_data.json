    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the instructions given and determine the final position relative to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the starting point, which we can consider as position 0.\n\n2. **Always face forward**: This instruction implies that the direction is fixed and does not change throughout the process. We will assume \"forward\" means moving in the positive direction.\n\n3. **Take 2 steps backward**: Since we are facing forward, taking steps backward means moving in the negative direction. So, we move from position 0 to position -2.\n\n4. **Take 8 steps backward**: Continuing to face forward, taking 8 more steps backward means moving further in the negative direction. So, we move from position -2 to position -10.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we return to the starting point, which is position 0.\n\n- Our final position is -10, which is not the starting point (0).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>No<<<answer>>>"
