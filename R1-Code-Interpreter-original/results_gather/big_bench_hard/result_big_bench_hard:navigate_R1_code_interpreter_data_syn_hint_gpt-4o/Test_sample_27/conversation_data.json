    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements step by step and determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Take 8 steps forward**: Assuming \"forward\" means moving in the positive y-direction, the new position will be (0, 8).\n\n3. **Take 5 steps backward**: Moving backward means moving in the negative y-direction. The new position will be (0, 8 - 5) = (0, 3).\n\n4. **Take 5 steps left**: Assuming \"left\" means moving in the negative x-direction, the new position will be (-5, 3).\n\n5. **Take 5 steps forward**: Moving forward again in the positive y-direction, the new position will be (-5, 3 + 5) = (-5, 8).\n\nNow, we compare the final position (-5, 8) with the initial position (0, 0). Since they are not the same, we do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
