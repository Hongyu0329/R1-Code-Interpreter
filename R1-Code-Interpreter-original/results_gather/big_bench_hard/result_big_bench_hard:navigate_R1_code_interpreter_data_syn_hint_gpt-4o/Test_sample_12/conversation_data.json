    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the instructions and determine if they lead back to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 3 steps**: Assume we start at the origin (0, 0) facing north. Taking 3 steps north would move us to (0, 3).\n\n2. **Turn around**: Turning around from facing north means we now face south.\n\n3. **Take 3 steps**: Moving 3 steps south from (0, 3) would bring us back to (0, 0).\n\n4. **Turn right**: Facing south and turning right means we now face west.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we are back at the starting point. We are indeed back at the origin (0, 0), but facing west.\n\nThe question asks if we return to the starting point, which is a position check, not a direction check. Since we are back at the origin, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
