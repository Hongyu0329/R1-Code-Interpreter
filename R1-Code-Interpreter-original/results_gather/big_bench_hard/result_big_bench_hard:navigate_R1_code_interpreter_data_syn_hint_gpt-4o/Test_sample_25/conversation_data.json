    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements step by step. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0).\n2. Take 9 steps forward: (0, 9).\n3. Take 6 steps forward: (0, 15).\n4. Take 9 steps forward: (0, 24).\n5. Take 6 steps forward: (0, 30).\n6. Take 2 steps forward: (0, 32).\n7. Turn left: Now facing left (negative x-direction).\n8. Take 6 steps: (-6, 32).\n9. Turn around: Now facing right (positive x-direction).\n10. Take 8 steps: (2, 32).\n\nThe final position is (2, 32), which is not the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
