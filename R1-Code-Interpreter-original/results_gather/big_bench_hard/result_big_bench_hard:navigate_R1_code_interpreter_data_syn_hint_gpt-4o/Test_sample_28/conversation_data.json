    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the instructions and determine if they lead back to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Turn left**: Facing north, turning left means facing west.\n\n3. **Take 5 steps**: Moving 5 steps west from (0, 0) leads to (-5, 0).\n\n4. **Turn around**: Facing west, turning around means facing east.\n\n5. **Turn right**: Facing east, turning right means facing south.\n\nNow, let's analyze the final position:\n\n- The final position is (-5, 0) facing south. \n- The starting point was (0, 0).\n\nSince the final position is not the same as the starting point, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
