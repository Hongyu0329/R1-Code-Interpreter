    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the directions and steps taken. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you are facing forward.\n2. **Take 2 steps right**: \n   - If you are facing forward (north), turning right means you are now facing east. \n   - Taking 2 steps right means you move 2 steps east.\n3. **Take 2 steps right**:\n   - From facing east, turning right again means you are now facing south.\n   - Taking 2 steps right means you move 2 steps south.\n4. **Take 4 steps left**:\n   - From facing south, turning left means you are now facing east.\n   - Taking 4 steps left means you move 4 steps east.\n\nNow, let's determine if you return to the starting point:\n\n- Initially, you are at the origin (0, 0).\n- After the first 2 steps right (east), you are at (2, 0).\n- After the second 2 steps right (south), you are at (2, -2).\n- After the 4 steps left (east), you are at (6, -2).\n\nThe final position (6, -2) is not the same as the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<'No'>>>"
