    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps based on the given instructions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 9 steps forward: This moves you to position 9.\n3. Take 1 step backward: This moves you to position 8.\n4. Take 4 steps backward: This moves you to position 4.\n5. Take 4 steps backward: This moves you to position 0.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the final position:\n\n- Starting point: 0\n- After 9 steps forward: 0 + 9 = 9\n- After 1 step backward: 9 - 1 = 8\n- After 4 steps backward: 8 - 4 = 4\n- After another 4 steps backward: 4 - 4 = 0\n\nThe final position is 0, which is the starting point. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
