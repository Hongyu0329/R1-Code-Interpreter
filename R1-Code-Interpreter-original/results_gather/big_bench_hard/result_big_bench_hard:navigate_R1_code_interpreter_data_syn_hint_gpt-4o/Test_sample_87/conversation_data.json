    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the final position relative to the starting point after following the given instructions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at position (0, 0) on a coordinate plane, facing forward (which we can assume is the positive y-direction).\n\n2. **Take 3 steps right**: \n   - Facing forward (positive y-direction), turning right means moving in the positive x-direction.\n   - New position: (3, 0).\n\n3. **Take 5 steps right**:\n   - Now facing the positive x-direction, turning right means moving in the negative y-direction.\n   - New position: (3, -5).\n\n4. **Take 2 steps backward**:\n   - Moving backward from the current direction (negative y-direction) means moving in the positive y-direction.\n   - New position: (3, -3).\n\nNow, we compare the final position (3, -3) with the starting point (0, 0). Since the final position is different from the starting point, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<'No'>>>"
