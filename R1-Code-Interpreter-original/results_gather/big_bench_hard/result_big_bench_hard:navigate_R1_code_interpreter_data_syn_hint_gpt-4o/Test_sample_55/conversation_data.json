    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the directions and movements described:\n\n1. \"Always face forward\" - This means the initial direction is forward, and we maintain this orientation throughout the process.\n2. \"Take 9 steps left\" - Since we are facing forward, turning left would mean moving to our left side, which is perpendicular to the forward direction.\n3. \"Take 4 steps backward\" - Moving backward means going in the opposite direction of forward.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n- Start facing forward.\n- Turn left and take 9 steps. Now, you are 9 steps to the left of your starting point.\n- From this position, take 4 steps backward. Since backward is opposite to forward, and you are currently facing left, moving backward means moving to the right from your current position.\n\nNow, calculate the final position relative to the starting point:\n\n- After taking 9 steps left, you are at position -9 (left is negative).\n- Taking 4 steps backward (which is right from the left-facing position) means moving 4 steps towards the starting point.\n\nFinal position calculation:\n- Start at 0.\n- Move 9 steps left: 0 - 9 = -9.\n- Move 4 steps backward (right from the left-facing position): -9 + 4 = -5.\n\nThe final position is -5, which means you are 5 steps to the left of the starting point. Therefore, you do not return to the starting point.\n\n<<<'No'>>>"
