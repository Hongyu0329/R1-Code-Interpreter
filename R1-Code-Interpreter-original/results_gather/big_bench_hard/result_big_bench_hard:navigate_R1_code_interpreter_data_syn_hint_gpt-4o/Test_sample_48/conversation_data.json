    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the directions and steps involved. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We start facing forward.\n2. **Take 2 steps right**: This means we turn 90 degrees to the right and take 2 steps in that direction.\n3. **Take 4 steps right**: We turn 90 degrees to the right again and take 4 steps in that direction.\n4. **Take 6 steps left**: We turn 90 degrees to the left and take 6 steps in that direction.\n\nLet's visualize the directions:\n\n- Starting facing forward (let's assume this is facing North).\n- Turn right (East) and take 2 steps.\n- Turn right again (South) and take 4 steps.\n- Turn left (East) and take 6 steps.\n\nNow, let's analyze the net movement:\n\n- From the starting point, we moved 2 steps East.\n- Then, we moved 4 steps South.\n- Finally, we moved 6 steps East.\n\nThe net movement is 8 steps East and 4 steps South from the starting point. Therefore, we do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
