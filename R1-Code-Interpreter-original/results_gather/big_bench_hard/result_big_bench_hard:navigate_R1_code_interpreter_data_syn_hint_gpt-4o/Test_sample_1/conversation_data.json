    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the given instructions will bring us back to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. \"Always face forward.\" - This means we maintain the same direction throughout the instructions.\n2. \"Take 10 steps left.\" - This implies a change in direction. If we are initially facing forward (let's assume north), taking 10 steps left means we are now facing west and moving 10 steps in that direction.\n3. \"Take 10 steps forward.\" - Since we are now facing west, taking 10 steps forward means moving 10 steps west.\n4. \"Take 7 steps forward.\" - Continuing to face west, we move 7 more steps in the same direction.\n5. \"Take 2 steps forward.\" - Again, moving 2 more steps west.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total movement:\n\n- Initially, we move 10 steps left (west).\n- Then, we move 10 + 7 + 2 = 19 steps forward (west).\n\nIn total, we have moved 10 + 19 = 29 steps west from the starting point. Since we have moved away from the starting point and not returned, the answer is \"No.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
