    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the sequence of movements and directions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Take 5 steps**: Assume you start at the origin (0, 0) and move in a positive direction (e.g., north or east). Let's assume north for simplicity, so you move to (0, 5).\n\n2. **Take 5 steps**: Continue in the same direction, moving to (0, 10).\n\n3. **Take 2 steps**: Continue in the same direction, moving to (0, 12).\n\n4. **Turn around**: This means you reverse your direction. If you were moving north, you now move south.\n\n5. **Take 8 steps**: Move in the new direction (south), which means you subtract from your current position. You move to (0, 4).\n\n6. **Take 4 steps**: Continue in the same direction (south), moving to (0, 0).\n\nAfter these steps, you end up at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
