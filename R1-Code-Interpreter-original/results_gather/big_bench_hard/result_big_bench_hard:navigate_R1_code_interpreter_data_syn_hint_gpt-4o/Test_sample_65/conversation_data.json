    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the instructions given will return us to the starting point or not. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. \"Always face forward.\" - This means we are facing a fixed direction, and all movements will be relative to this direction.\n2. \"Take 7 steps forward.\" - We move 7 steps in the forward direction.\n3. \"Take 3 steps backward.\" - We move 3 steps in the opposite direction of forward, effectively reducing our forward movement.\n4. \"Take 4 steps backward.\" - We move 4 more steps in the opposite direction of forward.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initial forward movement: +7 steps\n- First backward movement: -3 steps\n- Second backward movement: -4 steps\n\nNet movement = 7 - 3 - 4 = 0 steps\n\nSince the net movement is 0 steps, we end up at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes,\" we return to the starting point.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
