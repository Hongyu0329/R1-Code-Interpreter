    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the steps taken:\n\n1. **Take 4 steps**: This implies moving 4 steps in a certain direction.\n2. **Take 2 steps**: This implies moving 2 steps in the same direction as before.\n3. **Take 7 steps**: This implies moving 7 steps in the same direction as before.\n\nTo return to the starting point, the total number of steps forward should equal the total number of steps backward. However, in this scenario, all steps are in the same direction, so they add up rather than cancel each other out.\n\nLet's calculate the total steps:\n\n- Total steps = 4 + 2 + 7 = 13 steps in one direction.\n\nSince all steps are in the same direction, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
