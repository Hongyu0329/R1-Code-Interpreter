    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements and turns step by step. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Take 8 steps**: Move 8 steps north. New position: (0, 8).\n\n3. **Take 1 step**: Move 1 step north. New position: (0, 9).\n\n4. **Turn left**: Now facing west.\n\n5. **Turn left**: Now facing south.\n\n6. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 steps south. New position: (0, 0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
