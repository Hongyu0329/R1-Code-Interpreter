    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements and turns. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Take 9 steps**: Move north 9 steps. New position: (0, 9).\n\n3. **Take 5 steps**: Move north 5 steps. New position: (0, 14).\n\n4. **Take 2 steps**: Move north 2 steps. New position: (0, 16).\n\n5. **Take 10 steps**: Move north 10 steps. New position: (0, 26).\n\n6. **Turn right**: Now facing east.\n\n7. **Take 10 steps**: Move east 10 steps. New position: (10, 26).\n\n8. **Take 8 steps**: Move east 8 steps. New position: (18, 26).\n\nNow, let's check if the final position is the starting point (0, 0).\n\nThe final position is (18, 26), which is not the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<'No'>>>"
