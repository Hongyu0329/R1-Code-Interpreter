    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and turns to determine if the final position is the same as the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Instructions**:\n   - \"Turn left\": Facing west.\n   - \"Turn around\": Facing east.\n   - \"Take 1 step\": Move 1 step east to (1, 0).\n   - \"Take 10 steps\": Move 10 steps east to (11, 0).\n   - \"Turn around\": Facing west.\n   - \"Take 7 steps\": Move 7 steps west to (4, 0).\n   - \"Take 4 steps\": Move 4 steps west to (0, 0).\n\n3. **Final Position**: After following all the instructions, the final position is (0, 0), which is the same as the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
