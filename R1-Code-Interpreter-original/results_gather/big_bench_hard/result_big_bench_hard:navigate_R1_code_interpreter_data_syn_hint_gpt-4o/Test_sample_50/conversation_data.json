    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the sequence of movements:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0).\n2. Take 10 steps forward. Let's assume forward is in the positive direction, so you are now at position (10, 0).\n3. Take 7 steps forward. You are now at position (17, 0).\n4. Turn around. This means you will now move in the negative direction.\n5. Take 8 steps. Moving in the negative direction, you are now at position (9, 0).\n6. Take 9 steps. Continuing in the negative direction, you are now at position (0, 0).\n\nAfter these movements, you are back at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
