    "To determine if you return to the starting point after taking 3 steps, 6 steps, and 9 steps, we need to consider the net displacement after each set of steps.\n\n1. **3 Steps**: \n   - If you take 3 steps in one direction, you are 3 steps away from the starting point.\n\n2. **6 Steps**: \n   - If you take 6 steps in the same direction, you are now 9 steps away from the starting point (3 + 6 = 9).\n\n3. **9 Steps**: \n   - If you take 9 steps in the same direction, you are now 18 steps away from the starting point (9 + 9 = 18).\n\nSince all steps are taken in the same direction, you do not return to the starting point. The net displacement is 18 steps away from the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
