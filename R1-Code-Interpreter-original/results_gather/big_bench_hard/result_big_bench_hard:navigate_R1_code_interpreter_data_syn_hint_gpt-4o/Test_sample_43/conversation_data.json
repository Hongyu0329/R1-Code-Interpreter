    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Take 6 steps**: You move 6 steps in a certain direction.\n2. **Take 8 steps**: You continue in the same direction for 8 more steps, totaling 14 steps in that direction.\n3. **Take 7 steps**: You move 7 steps further in the same direction, totaling 21 steps in that direction.\n4. **Turn around**: You change direction to the opposite of where you were initially heading.\n5. **Take 6 steps**: You move 6 steps in the opposite direction.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initially, you moved 21 steps in one direction.\n- After turning around, you moved 6 steps back.\n\nThe net movement is \\(21 - 6 = 15\\) steps in the original direction. Since you have not returned to the starting point, the answer is \"No.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> No"
