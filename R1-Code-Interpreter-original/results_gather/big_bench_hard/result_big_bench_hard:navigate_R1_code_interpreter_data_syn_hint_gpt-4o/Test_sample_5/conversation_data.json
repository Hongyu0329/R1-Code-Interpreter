    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement described in the question. The question asks if you return to the starting point after taking 8 steps, turning around, and taking another 8 steps.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 8 steps in one direction. This means you move from position 0 to position 8.\n3. Turn around. This implies you change direction.\n4. Take 8 steps in the opposite direction. This means you move from position 8 back to position 0.\n\nAfter these steps, you end up at the starting position.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes,\" you do return to the starting point.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
