    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the instructions given and determine if they lead back to the starting point. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the starting point, which we can consider as the origin (0, 0) on a coordinate plane.\n\n2. **Take 1 step right**: This moves us from (0, 0) to (1, 0).\n\n3. **Take 4 steps right**: From (1, 0), moving 4 steps right takes us to (5, 0).\n\n4. **Take 5 steps left**: From (5, 0), moving 5 steps left takes us back to (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's determine if we return to the starting point:\n\n- We started at (0, 0).\n- After all the steps, we are back at (0, 0).\n\nSince we end up at the starting point, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
