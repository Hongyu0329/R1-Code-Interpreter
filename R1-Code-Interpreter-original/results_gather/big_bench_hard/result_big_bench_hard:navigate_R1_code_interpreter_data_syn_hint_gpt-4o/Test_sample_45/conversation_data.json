    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the instructions and determine if they lead back to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) on a grid.\n\n2. **Turn Right and Take 9 Steps**: \n   - If we start facing north (upwards on the grid), turning right would mean facing east (right on the grid).\n   - Taking 9 steps east would move us to (9, 0).\n\n3. **Turn Around**:\n   - Turning around from facing east would mean facing west (left on the grid).\n\n4. **Take 9 Steps**:\n   - Taking 9 steps west from (9, 0) would bring us back to (0, 0).\n\n5. **Turn Right**:\n   - If we are facing west, turning right would mean facing north again.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, we end up at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
