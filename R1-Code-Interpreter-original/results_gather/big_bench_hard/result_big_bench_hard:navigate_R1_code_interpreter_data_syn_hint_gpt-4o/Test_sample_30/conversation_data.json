    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements and turns. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin (0, 0) facing north.\n2. **Take 7 steps**: Move 7 steps north. New position: (0, 7).\n3. **Take 7 steps**: Move 7 steps north. New position: (0, 14).\n4. **Take 10 steps**: Move 10 steps north. New position: (0, 24).\n5. **Take 1 step**: Move 1 step north. New position: (0, 25).\n6. **Turn left**: Now facing west.\n7. **Take 7 steps**: Move 7 steps west. New position: (-7, 25).\n\nThe final position is (-7, 25), which is not the starting point (0, 0). Therefore, you do not return to the starting point.\n\n<<<answer>>> \n- No"
