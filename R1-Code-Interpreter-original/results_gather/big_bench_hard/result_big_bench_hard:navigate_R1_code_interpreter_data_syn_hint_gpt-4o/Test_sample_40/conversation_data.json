    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement from the starting point based on the given instructions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at position 0.\n\n2. **Instructions**:\n   - Take 8 steps left: This means moving 8 units in the negative direction.\n   - Take 6 steps right: This means moving 6 units in the positive direction.\n   - Take 10 steps right: This means moving 10 units in the positive direction.\n   - Take 2 steps left: This means moving 2 units in the negative direction.\n   - Take 5 steps left: This means moving 5 units in the negative direction.\n   - Take 1 step left: This means moving 1 unit in the negative direction.\n\n3. **Net Movement Calculation**:\n   - Total left steps = 8 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 16 steps\n   - Total right steps = 6 + 10 = 16 steps\n\n4. **Net Position**:\n   - Net position = Total right steps - Total left steps = 16 - 16 = 0\n\nSince the net position is 0, the final position is the same as the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
