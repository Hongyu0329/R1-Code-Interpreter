    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the sequence of steps and determine the final position relative to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at position 0.\n\n2. **Take 8 steps backward**: This means moving 8 steps in the negative direction. So, the position becomes -8.\n\n3. **Take 2 steps backward**: This means moving 2 more steps in the negative direction. So, the position becomes -10.\n\n4. **Take 10 steps forward**: This means moving 10 steps in the positive direction. So, the position becomes 0.\n\nNow, we compare the final position with the starting point:\n\n- The starting point is at position 0.\n- The final position is also at position 0.\n\nSince the final position is the same as the starting point, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes"
