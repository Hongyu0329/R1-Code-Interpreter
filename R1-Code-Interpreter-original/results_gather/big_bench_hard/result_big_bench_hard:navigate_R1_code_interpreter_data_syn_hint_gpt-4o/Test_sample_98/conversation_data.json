    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements and see if the final position is the same as the starting position. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0).\n2. Take 3 steps forward: (0, 3).\n3. Take 6 steps forward: (0, 9).\n4. Take 6 steps forward: (0, 15).\n5. Turn left: Now facing left (west).\n6. Take 8 steps: (-8, 15).\n7. Take 1 step: (-9, 15).\n8. Take 3 steps: (-12, 15).\n9. Take 7 steps: (-19, 15).\n10. Take 8 steps: (-27, 15).\n\nThe final position is (-27, 15), which is not the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
