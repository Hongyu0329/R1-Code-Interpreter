    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the instructions given and determine if they result in returning to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin at a certain point, facing forward.\n\n2. **Instruction 1**: \"Always face forward.\" - This means that throughout the instructions, the direction we are facing does not change.\n\n3. **Instruction 2**: \"Take 2 steps forward.\" - We move 2 steps in the direction we are facing.\n\n4. **Instruction 3**: \"Take 2 steps backward.\" - We move 2 steps in the opposite direction of where we are facing.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the net movement:\n\n- After taking 2 steps forward, we are 2 steps away from the starting point in the forward direction.\n- After taking 2 steps backward, we return to the starting point because moving backward cancels out the forward movement.\n\nThus, the net result of these movements is that we return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<'Yes'>>>"
