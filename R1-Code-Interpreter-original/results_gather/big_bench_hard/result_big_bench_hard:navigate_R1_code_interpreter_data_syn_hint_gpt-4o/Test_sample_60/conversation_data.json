    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the sequence of steps and determine if they result in returning to the starting point.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume the starting point is at position 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **First Movement**: Take 6 steps. This means moving 6 units forward from the starting point. New position = 0 + 6 = 6.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Take 2 steps. This means moving 2 units forward from the current position. New position = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Take 6 steps. This means moving 6 units forward from the current position. New position = 8 + 6 = 14.\n\nAfter analyzing the movements, the final position is 14, which is not the starting point (0). Therefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<'No'>>>"
