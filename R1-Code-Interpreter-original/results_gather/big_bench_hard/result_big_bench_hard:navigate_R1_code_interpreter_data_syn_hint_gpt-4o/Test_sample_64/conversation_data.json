    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize or simulate the instructions given and determine if they lead back to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume the initial direction is \"North.\"\n\n2. **Instructions**:\n   - \"Turn left\": If facing North, turning left means facing West.\n   - \"Take 4 steps\": Moving 4 steps West from (0, 0) leads to (-4, 0).\n   - \"Turn around\": If facing West, turning around means facing East.\n   - \"Take 4 steps\": Moving 4 steps East from (-4, 0) leads back to (0, 0).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: After following the instructions, we end up back at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes.\"\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
