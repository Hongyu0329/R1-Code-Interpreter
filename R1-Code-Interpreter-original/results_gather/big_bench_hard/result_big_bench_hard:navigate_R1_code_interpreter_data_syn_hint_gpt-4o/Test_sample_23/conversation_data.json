    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at the origin (0, 0) on a grid.\n2. **Take 7 steps**: Move 7 steps in a straight line. Let's assume you start by moving north (up the y-axis), so you end up at (0, 7).\n3. **Turn right**: Now you are facing east (positive x-axis).\n4. **Turn right**: Now you are facing south (down the y-axis).\n5. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps south. You move from (0, 7) to (0, 1).\n6. **Turn right**: Now you are facing west (negative x-axis).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the final position:\n\n- You started at (0, 0).\n- After taking 7 steps north, you were at (0, 7).\n- After turning right twice, you were facing south and moved 6 steps to (0, 1).\n- After turning right again, you are facing west, but you haven't moved further.\n\nSince you are at (0, 1) and not at the starting point (0, 0), you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<'No'>>>"
