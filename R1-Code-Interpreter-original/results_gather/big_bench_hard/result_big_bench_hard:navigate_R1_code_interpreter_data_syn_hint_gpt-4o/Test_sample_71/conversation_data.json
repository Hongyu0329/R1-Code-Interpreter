    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the sequence of movements and determine the final position relative to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at position 0.\n\n2. **Take 6 steps forward**: Moving forward 6 steps from position 0, the new position is 0 + 6 = 6.\n\n3. **Take 2 steps backward**: Moving backward 2 steps from position 6, the new position is 6 - 2 = 4.\n\n4. **Take 4 steps backward**: Moving backward 4 steps from position 4, the new position is 4 - 4 = 0.\n\nAfter executing all the steps, the final position is 0, which is the same as the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
