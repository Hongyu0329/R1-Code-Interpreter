    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the instructions given will return us to the starting point or not. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Always face forward.** - This means we are consistently moving in one direction, which we will consider as the positive direction.\n\n2. **Take 5 steps forward.** - This moves us 5 steps in the positive direction.\n\n3. **Take 7 steps backward.** - This moves us 7 steps in the negative direction.\n\n4. **Take 10 steps backward.** - This moves us 10 steps further in the negative direction.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Starting at position 0.\n- Move 5 steps forward: Position = 0 + 5 = 5\n- Move 7 steps backward: Position = 5 - 7 = -2\n- Move 10 steps backward: Position = -2 - 10 = -12\n\nThe final position is -12, which is not the starting point (0). Therefore, the answer is \"No\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
