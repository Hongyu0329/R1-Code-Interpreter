    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the movements and determine if they lead back to the starting point.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) on a 2D plane.\n\n2. **First Movement**: Take 10 steps forward. Assuming the initial direction is north (upwards on the y-axis), the new position will be (0, 10).\n\n3. **First Turn**: Turn left. Now facing west (left on the x-axis).\n\n4. **Second Turn**: Turn left again. Now facing south (downwards on the y-axis).\n\n5. **Second Movement**: Take 10 steps forward. Since we are facing south, we move back down the y-axis to (0, 0).\n\nAfter these movements, we are back at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes"
