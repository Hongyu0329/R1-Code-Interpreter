    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- `[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ]`\n\n1. The sequence starts with `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n2. Next is `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n3. Then `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n4. Then `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n5. Inside the parentheses, we have:\n   - `[ < > ]` which is already complete.\n   - `{ < > }` which is already complete.\n   - `[ [ ] ]` which is already complete.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- Close `)` for the `(`.\n- Close `]` for the `[`.\n- Close `>` for the `<`.\n- Close `]` for the initial `[`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n`[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ] > ]`\n\nLet's format the final answer. \n\n<<<[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ] > ]>>>"
