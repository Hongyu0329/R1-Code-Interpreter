    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, angle brackets `< >`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to ensure that each opening bracket is properly closed:\n\n1. **Square Brackets `[ ]`**: \n   - There are 3 opening square brackets `[` and 3 closing square brackets `]`. They are already balanced.\n\n2. **Angle Brackets `< >`**: \n   - There are 6 opening angle brackets `<` and 6 closing angle brackets `>`. They are already balanced.\n\n3. **Curly Braces `{ }`**: \n   - There is 1 opening curly brace `{` and 1 closing curly brace `}`. They are already balanced.\n\n4. **Parentheses `( )`**: \n   - There are 8 opening parentheses `(` and 8 closing parentheses `)`. They are already balanced.\n\nSince all types of brackets are already balanced, the sequence is complete and properly closed. Therefore, the final answer is the same as the input sequence.\n\n<<<[ [ < < { [ ] ( [ [ ( [ [ { [ ] } ] ] ) ( ) ] ] ) ( ) [ ] < [ ( ( ( ) ) ) ] < < < > [ ( ) ] > [ ] > > [ < > ] } > >>>>"
