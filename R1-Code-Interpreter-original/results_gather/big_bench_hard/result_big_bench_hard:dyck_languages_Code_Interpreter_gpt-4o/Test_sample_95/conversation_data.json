    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, braces, and angle brackets are properly closed. This involves matching each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol in the correct order.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses `(` and `)`**: Each opening parenthesis `(` must be closed by a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`.\n2. **Brackets `[` and `]`**: Each opening bracket `[` must be closed by a corresponding closing bracket `]`.\n3. **Braces `{` and `}`**: Each opening brace `{` must be closed by a corresponding closing brace `}`.\n4. **Angle brackets `<` and `>`**: Each opening angle bracket `<` must be closed by a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n\nWe will use a stack to keep track of the opening symbols and ensure they are closed in the correct order.
