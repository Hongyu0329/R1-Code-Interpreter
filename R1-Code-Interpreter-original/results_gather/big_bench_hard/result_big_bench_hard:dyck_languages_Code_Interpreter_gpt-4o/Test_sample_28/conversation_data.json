    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Square Brackets `[ ]`**: \n   - The sequence starts with `[ [ < [ [ ] ] > ] ]`. This part is already balanced.\n\n2. **Curly Braces `{ }`**:\n   - After the square brackets, we have `{ } { ( { ( ( ) ) ( ) { { [ [ ( { < { [ { [ ( < ( ( < < < [ ( ) ] [ ] > > > ) ) > < [ < { < ( ) > } > ] > ) ] } ] } > ( ( ) ) } ) [ ( ) ] ] ( < > ) ] } } } ) } [`.\n   - The first `{ }` is balanced.\n   - The second `{` opens a new block that needs to be closed.\n\n3. **Parentheses `( )`**:\n   - Inside the second `{`, we have `( { ( ( ) ) ( ) { { [ [ ( { < { [ { [ ( < ( ( < < < [ ( ) ] [ ] > > > ) ) > < [ < { < ( ) > } > ] > ) ] } ] } > ( ( ) ) } ) [ ( ) ] ] ( < > ) ] } } } ) } [`.\n   - The first `(` opens a new block that needs to be closed.\n\n4. **Angle Brackets `< >`**:\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have `< { [ { [ ( < ( ( < < < [ ( ) ] [ ] > > > ) ) > < [ < { < ( ) > } > ] > ) ] } ] } >`.\n   - The first `<` opens a new block that needs to be closed.\n\n5. **Closing the Blocks**:\n   - We need to close the blocks in the reverse order of their opening: `]`, `)`, `}`, `>`, `)`, `}`, `]`.\n\nLet's complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given sequence\nsequence = \"[ [ < [ [ ] ] > ] ] { } { ( { ( ( ) ) ( ) { { [ [ ( { < { [ { [ ( < ( ( < < < [ ( ) ] [ ] > > > ) ) > < [ < { < ( ) > } > ] > ) ] } ] } > ( ( ) ) } ) [ ( ) ] ] ( < > ) ] } } } ) } [\"\n\n# Count the number of each type of opening and closing brackets\nopen_square = sequence.count('[')\nclose_square = sequence.count(']')\nopen_curly = sequence.count('{')\nclose_curly = sequence.count('}')\nopen_paren = sequence.count('(')\nclose_paren = sequence.count(')')\nopen_angle = sequence.count('<')\nclose_angle = sequence.count('>')\n\n# Calculate the number of each type of closing bracket needed\nneeded_close_square = open_square - close_square\nneeded_close_curly = open_curly - close_curly\nneeded_close_paren = open_paren - close_paren\nneeded_close_angle = open_angle - close_angle\n\n# Construct the closing sequence\nclosing_sequence = ']' * needed_close_square + ')' * needed_close_paren + '}' * needed_close_curly + '>' * needed_close_angle\n\nclosing_sequence\nassistant > The sequence is missing one closing square bracket `]` to be properly balanced.
