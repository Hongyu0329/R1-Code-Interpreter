    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses are closed properly. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- `{ }` is a complete pair.\n- `< { }` is an incomplete pair because the `<` is not closed.\n- `< >` is a complete pair.\n- `(` is an incomplete pair because the `(` is not closed.\n\nTo close all the open parentheses, we need to add a `>` to close the `<` and a `)` to close the `(`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n`{ } < { } < > ( ) >`\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<{ } < { } < > ( ) >>>"
