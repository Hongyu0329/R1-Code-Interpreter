Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n2. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n3. Another `(` opens, so we need another `)` to close it.\n4. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n5. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n6. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n7. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n8. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n9. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n10. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n11. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n12. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n13. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n14. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n15. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n16. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n17. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n18. `>` closes the last opened `<`.\n19. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n20. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n21. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n22. `>` closes the last opened `<`.\n23. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n24. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n25. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n26. `>` closes the last opened `<`.\n27. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n28. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n29. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n30. `>` closes the last opened `<`.\n31. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n32. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n33. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n34. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n35. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n36. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n37. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n38. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n39. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n40. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n41. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n42. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n43. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n44. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n45. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n46. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n47. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n48. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n49. `>` closes the last opened `<`.\n50. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n51. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n52. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n53. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n54. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n55. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n56. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n57. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n58. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n59. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n60. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n61. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n62. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n63. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n64. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n65. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n66. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n67. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n68. `]` closes the last opened `[`.\n69. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n70. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n71. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n72. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n73. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n74. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n75. `(` opens, so we need a `)` to close it.\n76. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n77. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n78. `)` closes the last opened `(`.\n79. `}` closes the last opened `{`.\n80. `>` closes the last opened `<`.\n\nNow, let's write the completed sequence:\n\n```\n< ( ( [ < > { [ { ( ) } ] < { < { } > [ ( < > ) ] } > } [ < > ] ] ) { { ( { ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] < { } > ) ) { { ( [ [ ] ] ) } [ ( ) ] { { [ ] } } } } ) } ( { } ) } >\n```\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
