    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that the parentheses are closed properly, we need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket. The input sequence is `< [ ]`.\n\n1. The `<` character is an opening angle bracket, so it needs a closing `>` character.\n2. The `[` character is an opening square bracket, and it is already closed with the `]` character.\n\nTherefore, to complete the sequence, we need to add a closing `>` character at the end.\n\nThe completed sequence is `< [ ] >`.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
