    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n1. `[ < > ]` - This part is already complete with matching brackets.\n2. `[ [ < > ]` - This part has an extra opening square bracket `[` that needs to be closed.\n\nTo close the sequence properly, we need to add a closing square bracket `]` at the end.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `[ < > ] [ [ < > ] ]`\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[ < > ] [ [ < > ] ]>>>"
