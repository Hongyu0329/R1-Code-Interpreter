The first `{` needs a matching `}`.\n2. The second `{` needs a matching `}`.\n3. The third `{` already has a matching `}`.\n\nTo properly close all the braces, we need to add two more closing braces `}`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `{ { { } } } }`\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n<<<{ { { } } } }>>>"
