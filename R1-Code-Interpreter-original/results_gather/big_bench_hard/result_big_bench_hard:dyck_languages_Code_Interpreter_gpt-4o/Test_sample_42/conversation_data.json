    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket. The sequence given is:\n\n- `{` is an opening curly brace, so it needs a closing curly brace `}`.\n- `<` is an opening angle bracket, so it needs a closing angle bracket `>`.\n- Another `<` is an opening angle bracket, so it needs another closing angle bracket `>`.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n- `{ < <` becomes `{ < < > > }`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is `{ < < > > }`.\n\n<<<{ < < > > }>>>"
