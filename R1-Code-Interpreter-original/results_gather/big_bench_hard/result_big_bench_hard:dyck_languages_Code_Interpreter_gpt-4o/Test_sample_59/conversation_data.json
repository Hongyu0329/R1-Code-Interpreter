    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The given sequence is:\n\n\\[ < [ < > ] \\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The sequence starts with `<`, which needs a corresponding `>`.\n2. Next, we have `[`, which needs a corresponding `]`.\n3. Inside the square brackets, we have `< >`, which is already complete.\n\nNow, we need to close the square bracket and then the angle bracket:\n\n- The square bracket `]` is already closed.\n- We need to close the angle bracket `>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ < [ < > ] > \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < [ < > ] > >>>"
