    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol. The sequence uses two types of symbols: angle brackets `<` and `>`, and parentheses `(` and `)`.\n\nGiven the input sequence: `( < < < >`\n\n1. The opening parenthesis `(` needs a closing parenthesis `)`.\n2. Each opening angle bracket `<` needs a closing angle bracket `>`.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n- `(`: Needs a `)`.\n- `<`: Needs a `>`.\n- `<`: Needs a `>`.\n- `<`: Needs a `>`.\n- `>`: This closes one of the `<`.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to add:\n\n- Two more `>` to close the remaining two `<`.\n- One `)` to close the `(`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `( < < < > > > )`\n\nThe final answer is: <<< ( < < < > > > ) >>>"
