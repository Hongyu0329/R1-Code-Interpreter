    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to balance the opening and closing brackets. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- `<` is an opening angle bracket.\n- `(` is an opening parenthesis.\n- `>` is a closing angle bracket.\n\nThe sequence is: `< < ( < >`\n\n1. The first `<` needs a matching `>`.\n2. The second `<` also needs a matching `>`.\n3. The `(` needs a matching `)`.\n4. The third `<` is matched by the `>` that follows it.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to add:\n- A `>` to match the first `<`.\n- A `>` to match the second `<`.\n- A `)` to match the `(`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `< < ( < > ) > >`\n\nThe final answer is: <<< < < ( < > ) > > >>>"
