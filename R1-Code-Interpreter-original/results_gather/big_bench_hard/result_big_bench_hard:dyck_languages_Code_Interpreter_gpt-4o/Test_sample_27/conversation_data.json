    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n1. `<` - Open angle bracket\n2. `<` - Open angle bracket\n3. `{` - Open curly brace\n4. `(` - Open parenthesis\n5. `<` - Open angle bracket\n6. `(` - Open parenthesis\n7. `)` - Close parenthesis (matches the 6th character)\n8. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the 5th character)\n9. `)` - Close parenthesis (matches the 4th character)\n10. `}` - Close curly brace (matches the 3rd character)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining two angle brackets:\n\n11. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the 2nd character)\n12. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the 1st character)\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `< < { ( < ( ) > ) } > >`\n\nThe final answer is: <<< < < { ( < ( ) > ) } > > >>>"
