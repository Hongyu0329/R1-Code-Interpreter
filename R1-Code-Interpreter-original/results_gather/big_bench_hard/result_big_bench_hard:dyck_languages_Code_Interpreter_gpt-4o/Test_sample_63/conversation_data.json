    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- `[ < < { } > < > > ( )`\n\n1. The sequence starts with `[`, which needs to be closed with `]`.\n2. The first `<` needs to be closed with `>`.\n3. The second `<` needs to be closed with `>`.\n4. The `{ }` is already properly closed.\n5. The next `<` is closed with `>`.\n6. The `(` is closed with `)`.\n\nNow, let's close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first `<` is closed with `>`.\n- The second `<` is closed with `>`.\n- The `[` is closed with `]`.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n- `[ < < { } > < > > ( ) > > ]`\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ < < { } > < > > ( ) > > ]>>>"
