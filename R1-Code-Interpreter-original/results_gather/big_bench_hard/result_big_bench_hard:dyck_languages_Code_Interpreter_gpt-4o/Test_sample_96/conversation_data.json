    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence while ensuring that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol. The sequence given is:\n\nInput: `< < { } >`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `<` - Another opening angle bracket.\n3. `{` - This is an opening curly brace.\n4. `}` - This is a closing curly brace, which matches the last opening curly brace `{`.\n5. `>` - This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the last opening angle bracket `<`.\n\nNow, we need to close the first opening angle bracket `<` that hasn't been closed yet. Therefore, we need to add one more `>` at the end.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `< < { } > >`\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < < { } > > >>>"
