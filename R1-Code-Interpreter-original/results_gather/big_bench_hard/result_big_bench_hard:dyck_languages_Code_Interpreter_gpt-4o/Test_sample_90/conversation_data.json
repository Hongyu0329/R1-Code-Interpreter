    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol. The sequence uses the following pairs:\n\n- Curly braces: `{ }`\n- Angle brackets: `< >`\n- Parentheses: `( )`\n- Square brackets: `[ ]`\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. `{` - Open curly brace\n2. `<` - Open angle bracket\n3. `(` - Open parenthesis\n4. `[` - Open square bracket\n5. `(` - Open parenthesis\n6. `(` - Open parenthesis\n7. `[` - Open square bracket\n8. `<` - Open angle bracket\n9. `{` - Open curly brace\n10. `(` - Open parenthesis\n11. `{ }` - Curly braces are closed\n12. `)` - Close parenthesis\n13. `}` - Close curly brace\n14. `<` - Open angle bracket\n15. `<` - Open angle bracket\n16. `>` - Close angle bracket\n17. `>` - Close angle bracket\n18. `>` - Close angle bracket\n19. `]` - Close square bracket\n20. `)` - Close parenthesis\n21. `)` - Close parenthesis\n22. `]` - Close square bracket\n23. `)` - Close parenthesis\n24. `>` - Close angle bracket\n\nNow, let's determine the missing closing symbols:\n\n- The sequence starts with `{`, which is closed by `}`.\n- The sequence starts with `<`, which is closed by `>`.\n- The sequence starts with `(`, which is closed by `)`.\n- The sequence starts with `[`, which is closed by `]`.\n\nThe sequence is already balanced, so no additional closing symbols are needed.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n`{ < ( [ ( ( [ < { ( { } ) } < < > > > ] ) ) ] ) > } > ) ]`\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<{ < ( [ ( ( [ < { ( { } ) } < < > > > ] ) ) ] ) > }>>>"
