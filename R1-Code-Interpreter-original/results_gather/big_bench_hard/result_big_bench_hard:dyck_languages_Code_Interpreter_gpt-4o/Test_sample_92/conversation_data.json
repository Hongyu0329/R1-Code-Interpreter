    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- The sequence starts with `[ [ < [ ] > ] ] <`.\n- The brackets are: `[`, `[`, `<`, `[`, `]`, `>`, `]`, `]`, `<`.\n\nNow, let's match the opening and closing brackets:\n\n1. The first `[` is closed by the last `]`.\n2. The second `[` is closed by the second last `]`.\n3. The `<` is closed by the `>`.\n4. The third `[` is closed by the `]`.\n\nThe sequence ends with an opening `<` that needs to be closed. Therefore, we need to add a `>` at the end to properly close the sequence.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `[ [ < [ ] > ] ] < >`.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ [ < [ ] > ] ] < >>>"
