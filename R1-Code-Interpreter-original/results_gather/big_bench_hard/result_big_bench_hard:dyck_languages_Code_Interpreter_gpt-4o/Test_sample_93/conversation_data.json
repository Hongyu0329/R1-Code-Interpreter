    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- `[ < > [ [ < [ ] > ]`\n\n1. The sequence starts with `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n2. Next, `<` is opened and closed with `>`.\n3. Then, another `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n4. Another `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n5. `<` is opened, which needs a closing `>`.\n6. `[`, which is closed with `]`.\n7. `>` closes the previously opened `<`.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first `[`, the second `[`, and the third `[` are still open.\n\nTo close them properly, we need to add `]]]` at the end.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `[ < > [ [ < [ ] > ] ] ]`\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[ < > [ [ < [ ] > ] ] ]>>>"
