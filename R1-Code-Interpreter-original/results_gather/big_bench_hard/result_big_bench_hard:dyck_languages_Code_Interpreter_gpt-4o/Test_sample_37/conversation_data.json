    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and angle brackets `< >`. \n\nLet's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- The sequence starts with four opening square brackets: `[ [ [ [`\n- Then, it has an opening angle bracket `<` followed by an opening curly brace `{` and an opening parenthesis `(`.\n- The first closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opening parenthesis `(`.\n- The closing curly brace `}` matches the last opening curly brace `{`.\n- The sequence continues with an opening parenthesis `(` and a closing parenthesis `)`, which match each other.\n- The closing angle bracket `>` matches the last opening angle bracket `<`.\n- The sequence then has an opening curly brace `{` and an opening parenthesis `(`.\n- The closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opening parenthesis `(`.\n- The sequence ends with a closing square bracket `]` and an opening curly brace `{` and an opening parenthesis `(`.\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to close all the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- Close the last opened parenthesis `(` with `)`.\n- Close the last opened curly brace `{` with `}`.\n- Close the remaining three opened square brackets with `] ] ]`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ [ [ [ < { ( ) } ( ) > { ( ) } ] { ( ) } ) } ] ] ]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ [ [ [ < { ( ) } ( ) > { ( ) } ] { ( ) } ) } ] ] ]>>>"
