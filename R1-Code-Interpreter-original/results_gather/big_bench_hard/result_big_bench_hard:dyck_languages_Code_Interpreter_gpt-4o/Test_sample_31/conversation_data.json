    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n- `(`: This is an opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n- `<`: This is an opening angle bracket and needs a closing `>`.\n- `[`: This is an opening square bracket and needs a closing `]`.\n- `(`: This is another opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n\nTo close these properly, we need to close them in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n1. Close the last opened parenthesis `(` with `)`.\n2. Close the square bracket `[` with `]`.\n3. Close the angle bracket `<` with `>`.\n4. Close the first opened parenthesis `(` with `)`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n`( < [ ( ) ] > )`\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<( < [ ( ) ] > )>>>"
