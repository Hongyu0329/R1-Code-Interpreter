The sequence given is:\n\n- `(`: This is an opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n- `(`: This is another opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n- `<`: This is an opening angle bracket and needs a closing `>`.\n- `>`: This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the previous `<`.\n\nNow, let's close the remaining open symbols:\n\n- The first `(` needs a `)`.\n- The second `(` also needs a `)`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n`( ( < > ) )`\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<( ( < > ) )>>>"
