    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses, brackets, and braces are closed properly, we need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol in the reverse order of their appearance.\n\nGiven the input: `< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ]`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` is opened first, so it should be closed last.\n2. `{` is opened next, so it should be closed second to last.\n3. `<` is opened next, so it should be closed third to last.\n4. `[` is opened next, so it should be closed fourth to last.\n5. `[` is opened next, so it should be closed fifth to last.\n6. `(` is opened next, so it should be closed sixth to last.\n7. `{ }` is already closed.\n\nNow, let's close the remaining symbols in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- Close `(` with `)`.\n- Close `[` with `]`.\n- Close the next `[` with `]`.\n- Close `<` with `>`.\n- Close `{` with `}`.\n- Close `<` with `>`.\n\nSo, the completed sequence is: `< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ] ) ] > } >`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ] ) ] > } > >>>"
