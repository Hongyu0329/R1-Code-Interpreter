    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol in the correct order. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, angle brackets `<>`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`.\n\nGiven the input sequence: `[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } >`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `[`: Open square bracket\n2. `(`: Open parenthesis\n3. `<`: Open angle bracket\n4. `{`: Open curly brace\n5. `[`: Open square bracket\n6. `(`: Open parenthesis\n7. `)`: Close parenthesis (matches the last open parenthesis)\n8. `]`: Close square bracket (matches the last open square bracket)\n9. `}`: Close curly brace (matches the last open curly brace)\n10. `>`: Close angle bracket (matches the last open angle bracket)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n11. `)`: Close parenthesis (matches the second open parenthesis)\n12. `]`: Close square bracket (matches the first open square bracket)\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } > ) ]`\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } > ) ]>>>"
