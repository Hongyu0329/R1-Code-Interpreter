    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - Open angle bracket\n2. `<` - Open angle bracket\n3. `[` - Open square bracket\n4. `]` - Close square bracket (matches the third character)\n5. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the second character)\n6. `(` - Open parenthesis\n7. `<` - Open angle bracket\n8. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the seventh character)\n9. `)` - Close parenthesis (matches the sixth character)\n10. `<` - Open angle bracket\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first `<` needs a `>` to close.\n- The last `<` also needs a `>` to close.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `< < [ ] > ( < > ) < > >`\n\nThe final answer is: <<< < < [ ] > ( < > ) < > > >>>"
