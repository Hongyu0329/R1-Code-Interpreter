    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n```\n{ < { } > { (\n```\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `{` - This is an opening curly brace.\n2. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n3. `{` - This is another opening curly brace.\n4. `}` - This is a closing curly brace, which matches the last opened curly brace.\n5. `>` - This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the last opened angle bracket.\n6. `{` - This is another opening curly brace.\n7. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n1. `)` - Closes the last opened parenthesis.\n2. `}` - Closes the last opened curly brace.\n3. `}` - Closes the first opened curly brace.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n```\n{ < { } > { ( ) } }\n```\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{ < { } > { ( ) } }>>>"
