    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses and braces are properly closed, we need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol. The given sequence is:\n\n- Opening parenthesis: `(`\n- Opening brace: `{`\n- Opening brace: `{`\n- Closing brace: `}`\n- Closing parenthesis: `)`\n\nTo balance this sequence, we need to add a closing brace `}` and a closing parenthesis `)` at the end. Therefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n`( { { } } )`\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( { { } } )>>>"
