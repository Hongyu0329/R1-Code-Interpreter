    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence uses the following types of brackets: `<`, `{`, `[`, and `(`. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. `<` is opened.\n2. `{` is opened.\n3. `[` is opened.\n4. `[` is opened.\n5. `(` is opened.\n6. `(` is opened.\n7. `<` is opened.\n8. `{` is opened.\n9. `<` is opened.\n10. `{` is opened.\n11. `[` is opened.\n12. `]` is closed. (Matches the last opened `[`)\n13. `}` is closed. (Matches the last opened `{`)\n14. `>` is closed. (Matches the last opened `<`)\n15. `}` is closed. (Matches the last opened `{`)\n16. `>` is closed. (Matches the last opened `<`)\n17. `)` is closed. (Matches the last opened `(`)\n18. `)` is closed. (Matches the last opened `(`)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining opened brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n19. `]` is closed. (Matches the last opened `[`)\n20. `]` is closed. (Matches the last opened `[`)\n21. `}` is closed. (Matches the last opened `{`)\n22. `>` is closed. (Matches the last opened `<`)\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n`< { } [ [ ( ( < { < { [ ] } > } > ) ) ] ] } >`\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<] ] } >>>"
