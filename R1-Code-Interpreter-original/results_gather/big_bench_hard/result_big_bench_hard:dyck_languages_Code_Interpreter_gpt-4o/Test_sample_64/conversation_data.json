    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol. The sequence uses the following pairs:\n\n- Square brackets: [ and ]\n- Parentheses: ( and )\n- Angle brackets: < and >\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence:\n\n1. [ - Open square bracket\n2. < - Open angle bracket\n3. ( - Open parenthesis\n4. < - Open angle bracket\n5. < - Open angle bracket\n6. > - Close angle bracket (matches the last opened angle bracket)\n7. [ - Open square bracket\n8. ] - Close square bracket (matches the last opened square bracket)\n9. ( - Open parenthesis\n10. ) - Close parenthesis (matches the last opened parenthesis)\n11. > - Close angle bracket (matches the second last opened angle bracket)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open symbols:\n\n- The first angle bracket < needs a closing >\n- The first parenthesis ( needs a closing )\n- The first square bracket [ needs a closing ]\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > ) > ]\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n<<<[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > ) > ]>>>"
