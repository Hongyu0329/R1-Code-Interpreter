    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, and square brackets `[]`.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Opening Brackets:**\n   - `(`: 2\n   - `{`: 2\n   - `<`: 2\n   - `(`: 1\n   - `[`: 1\n   - `{`: 1\n   - `<`: 1\n   - `(`: 1\n   - `<`: 1\n   - `(`: 2\n   - `[`: 1\n   - `{`: 1\n\n2. **Closing Brackets:**\n   - `)`: 2\n   - `}`: 2\n   - `>`: 2\n   - `)`: 1\n   - `]`: 1\n   - `}`: 1\n   - `>`: 1\n   - `}`: 1\n   - `]`: 1\n\nNow, let's match the opening and closing brackets to ensure they are properly nested and balanced. We'll start from the innermost brackets and work our way outwards.\n\nLet's complete the sequence:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[', '>': '<'}\n    opening_brackets = set(matching_bracket.values())\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = deque()\n    \n    # Iterate over the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in opening_brackets:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Unbalanced sequence\"\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completion = \"\"\n    while stack:\n        opening = stack.pop()\n        for closing, opening_match in matching_bracket.items():\n            if opening == opening_match:\n                completion += closing\n                break\n    \n    return completion\n\n# Given sequence\nsequence = \"( ( { < > ( ) [ { < ( < > < ( ( ) ( [ { } ] ) ) > { { } { ( ) } } ) [ ] > } ] { { } } }\"\n\n# Get the completion\ncompletion = complete_sequence(sequence)\ncompletion\nassistant > The sequence can be completed by adding the closing brackets `))` to ensure all opening brackets are properly closed.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{( ( { < > ( ) [ { < ( < > < ( ( ) ( [ { } ] ) ) > { { } { ( ) } } ) [ ] > } ] { { } } } \\text{))}}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<))>>>}\n\\]"
