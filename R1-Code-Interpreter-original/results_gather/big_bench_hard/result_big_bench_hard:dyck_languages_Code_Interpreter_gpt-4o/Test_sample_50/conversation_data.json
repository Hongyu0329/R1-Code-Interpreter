    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis, so we need a closing `)`.\n2. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket, so we need a closing `>`.\n3. `>` - This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the previous `<`.\n4. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis, so we need a closing `)`.\n5. `[` - This is an opening square bracket, so we need a closing `]`.\n6. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis, so we need a closing `)`.\n\nNow, let's close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- The last opened is `(`, so we close it with `)`.\n- Next, we have `[`, so we close it with `]`.\n- Next, we have `(`, so we close it with `)`.\n- Finally, we have `(`, so we close it with `)`.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `( < > ( [ ( ) ] ) )`\n\nThus, the final answer is: \n\n<<<( < > ( [ ( ) ] ) )>>>"
