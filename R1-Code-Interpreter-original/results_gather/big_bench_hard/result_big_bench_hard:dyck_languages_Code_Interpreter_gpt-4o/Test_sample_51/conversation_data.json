    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n1. `(` - Open parenthesis\n2. `<` - Open angle bracket\n3. `{` - Open curly brace\n4. `(` - Open parenthesis\n5. `)` - Close parenthesis\n6. `{` - Open curly brace\n7. `}` - Close curly brace\n8. `}` - Close curly brace\n9. `(` - Open parenthesis\n10. `<` - Open angle bracket\n11. `>` - Close angle bracket\n12. `)` - Close parenthesis\n13. `>` - Close angle bracket\n\nNow, let's identify the unclosed brackets:\n\n- The first `(` is not closed.\n- The first `<` is not closed.\n\nTo properly close the sequence, we need to add `)` to close the first `(` and `>` to close the first `<`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) > ) >`\n\nThe final answer is: <<<answer>>>"
