    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n1. `( { } )` - This part is already complete with matching parentheses and curly braces.\n2. `< { < { } >` - This part has:\n   - An opening angle bracket `<`\n   - An opening curly brace `{`\n   - Another opening angle bracket `<`\n   - A pair of curly braces `{ }`\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- Close the innermost angle bracket `>`\n- Close the curly brace `}`\n- Close the outermost angle bracket `>`\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n`( { } ) < { < { } > } >`\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<( { } ) < { < { } > } >>>"
