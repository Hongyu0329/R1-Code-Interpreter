    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- `[ ]` is already complete.\n- `< { < { [ ( ) ] } > }` needs to be completed.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n2. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n3. `<` opens, so we need a `>` to close it.\n4. `{` opens, so we need a `}` to close it.\n5. `[` opens, so we need a `]` to close it.\n6. `(` opens, and `)` closes it. This is already complete.\n7. `]` closes the `[` from step 5.\n8. `}` closes the `{` from step 4.\n9. `>` closes the `<` from step 3.\n10. `}` closes the `{` from step 2.\n11. `>` closes the `<` from step 1.\n\nThe sequence is already complete and properly closed. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ ] < { < { [ ( ) ] } > }>>>"
