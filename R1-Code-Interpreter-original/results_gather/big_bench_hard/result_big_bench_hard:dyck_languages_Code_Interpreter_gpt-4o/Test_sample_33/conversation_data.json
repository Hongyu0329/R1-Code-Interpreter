The sequence given is:\n\n< ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] ) )\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` needs to be closed with `>`.\n2. `(` needs to be closed with `)`.\n3. Another `(` needs to be closed with `)`.\n4. `[` needs to be closed with `]`.\n5. `(` needs to be closed with `)`.\n6. `[` is already closed with `]`.\n7. The `(` from step 5 is closed with `)`.\n8. The `[` from step 4 is closed with `]`.\n9. The `(` from step 3 is closed with `)`.\n10. The `(` from step 2 is closed with `)`.\n11. Finally, the `<` from step 1 is closed with `>`.\n\nThe sequence is already properly closed, so the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
