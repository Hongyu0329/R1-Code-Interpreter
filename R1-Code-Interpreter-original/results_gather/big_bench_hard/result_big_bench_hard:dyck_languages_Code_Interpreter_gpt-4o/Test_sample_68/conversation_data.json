    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses and brackets are properly closed, we need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol. The sequence given is:\n\n- `(`: This is an opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n- `[`: This is an opening bracket and needs a closing `]`.\n- `(`: This is another opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n\nTo properly close all the opened symbols, we need to add the corresponding closing symbols in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n1. Close the last opened parenthesis `(` with `)`.\n2. Close the opened bracket `[` with `]`.\n3. Close the first opened parenthesis `(` with `)`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `( [ ( ) ] )`.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n<<<( [ ( ) ] )>>>"
