    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n- `<` is closed by `>`\n- `[` is closed by `]`\n- `{` is closed by `}`\n- `(` is closed by `)`\n\nThe input sequence is:\n\n```\n< [ { { < ( ) > { < { } > ( < ( ) > { < [ ( { { ( < [ ] > ) } } { ( ( [ [ { } [ ] ] ] ) ) } ) ] > } ) } }\n```\n\nLet's count the opening and closing brackets to determine which ones are missing:\n\n- `<` appears 5 times, `>` appears 3 times\n- `[` appears 4 times, `]` appears 2 times\n- `{` appears 11 times, `}` appears 5 times\n- `(` appears 8 times, `)` appears 4 times\n\nWe need to add the missing closing brackets in the correct order to balance the sequence. Let's do this step by step:\n\n1. Add 2 `>` to balance `<`.\n2. Add 2 `]` to balance `[`.\n3. Add 6 `}` to balance `{`.\n4. Add 4 `)` to balance `(`.\n\nLet's construct the completed sequence.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given sequence\nsequence = \"< [ { { < ( ) > { < { } > ( < ( ) > { < [ ( { { ( < [ ] > ) } } { ( ( [ [ { } [ ] ] ] ) ) } ) ] > } ) } }\"\n\n# Count the opening and closing brackets\nopen_close_counts = {\n    '<': sequence.count('<'),\n    '>': sequence.count('>'),\n    '[': sequence.count('['),\n    ']': sequence.count(']'),\n    '{': sequence.count('{'),\n    '}': sequence.count('}'),\n    '(': sequence.count('('),\n    ')': sequence.count(')')\n}\n\n# Calculate the missing closing brackets\nmissing_closings = {\n    '>': open_close_counts['<'] - open_close_counts['>'],\n    ']': open_close_counts['['] - open_close_counts[']'],\n    '}': open_close_counts['{'] - open_close_counts['}'],\n    ')': open_close_counts['('] - open_close_counts[')']\n}\n\n# Construct the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + '>' * missing_closings['>'] + ']' * missing_closings[']'] + '}' * missing_closings['}'] + ')' * missing_closings[')']\n\ncompleted_sequence\nassistant > The completed sequence with properly closed parentheses is:\n\n<<< < [ { { < ( ) > { < { } > ( < ( ) > { < [ ( { { ( < [ ] > ) } } { ( ( [ [ { } [ ] ] ] ) ) } ) ] > } ) } }>]}> >>>"
