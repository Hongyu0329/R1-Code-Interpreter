    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. `(` - Open parenthesis\n2. `{` - Open curly brace\n3. `}` - Close curly brace\n4. `<` - Open angle bracket\n5. `>` - Close angle bracket\n6. `{` - Open curly brace\n7. `<` - Open angle bracket\n8. `{` - Open curly brace\n9. `(` - Open parenthesis\n10. `<` - Open angle bracket\n11. `>` - Close angle bracket\n12. `)` - Close parenthesis\n13. `}` - Close curly brace\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- Close the angle bracket `<` with `>`.\n- Close the curly brace `{` with `}`.\n- Close the curly brace `{` with `}`.\n- Close the parenthesis `(` with `)`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n`( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > } } )`\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > } } )>>>"
