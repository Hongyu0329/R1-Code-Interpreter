    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n- `{ { } ( ( < > )`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `{` - Open curly brace\n2. `{` - Open curly brace\n3. `}` - Close curly brace (matches the second `{`)\n4. `(` - Open parenthesis\n5. `(` - Open parenthesis\n6. `<` - Open angle bracket\n7. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the `<`)\n8. `)` - Close parenthesis (matches the second `(`)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first `(` needs a closing `)`.\n- The first `{` needs a closing `}`.\n\nSo, the completed sequence is:\n\n`{ { } ( ( < > ) ) }`\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{ { } ( ( < > ) ) }>>>"
