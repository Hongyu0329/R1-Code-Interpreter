The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ < \\{ [ ] \\} >\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. The first bracket is `[`, which is closed by `]`.\n2. The second bracket is `<`, which should be closed by `>`.\n3. The third bracket is `{`, which should be closed by `}`.\n\nThe sequence is currently:\n\n\\[ < \\{ [ ] \\} >\n\nTo close all the brackets properly, we need to add `}` and `>` at the end:\n\n\\[ < \\{ [ ] \\} > \\} \\>\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ < \\{ [ ] \\} \\} \\>\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[ < { [ ] } > } >>>"
