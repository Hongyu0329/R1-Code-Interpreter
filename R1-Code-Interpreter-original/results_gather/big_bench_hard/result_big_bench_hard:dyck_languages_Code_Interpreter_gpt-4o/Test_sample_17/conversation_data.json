The `<` symbol is not a parenthesis, so it doesn't need a matching pair.\n2. The first `(` needs a matching `)`.\n3. The second `(` already has a matching `)`.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to add a `)` to match the first `(`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `< ( ( ) )`\n\nThe final answer is: <<< < ( ( ) ) >>>"
