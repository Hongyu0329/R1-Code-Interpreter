    "\nassistant > To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, parentheses `()`, and square brackets `[]`. We need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to ensure all brackets are properly closed. We'll keep track of the opening brackets and match them with the closing brackets as we progress through the sequence.\n\nGiven sequence:\n```\n{ { { < { } < ( ( < > ) ) > > } } { [ [ { } ] ] [ ] < < { } > [ ( ) { ( { } ) } ] > ( [ < [ ( ( { } ( ) < > < [ < < { { ( [ { } ] ) } } { } { } > > ] > ( ) ) ) < > ] > ] )\n```\n\nLet's process this sequence to find the missing closing brackets.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_missing_closures(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {\n        '}': '{',\n        '>': '<',\n        ')': '(',\n        ']': '['\n    }\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = deque()\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket:\n            # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid\n                return None\n    \n    # If stack is not empty, we have unmatched opening brackets\n    missing_closures = []\n    while stack:\n        opening_bracket = stack.pop()\n        # Find the corresponding closing bracket\n        for closing, opening in matching_bracket.items():\n            if opening == opening_bracket:\n                missing_closures.append(closing)\n                break\n    \n    return ''.join(missing_closures)\n\n# Given sequence\nsequence = \"{ { { < { } < ( ( < > ) ) > > } } { [ [ { } ] ] [ ] < < { } > [ ( ) { ( { } ) } ] > ( [ < [ ( ( { } ( ) < > < [ < < { { ( [ { } ] ) } } { } { } > > ] > ( ) ) ) < > ] > ] )\"\n\n# Find missing closures\nmissing_closures = find_missing_closures(sequence)\nmissing_closures\nassistant > The sequence is missing two closing curly braces `}}` at the end to properly close all the opened brackets. \n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n```\n{ { { < { } < ( ( < > ) ) > > } } { [ [ { } ] ] [ ] < < { } > [ ( ) { ( { } ) } ] > ( [ < [ ( ( { } ( ) < > < [ < < { { ( [ { } ] ) } } { } { } > > ] > ( ) ) ) < > ] > ] ) }}\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```\n<<<}}>>>\n```"
