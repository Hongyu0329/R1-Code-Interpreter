    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the brown book.\n2. The gray book is to the left of the blue book.\n3. The green book is to the right of the blue book.\n4. The red book is the leftmost.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the red book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The green book is to the right of the blue book, so the blue book must be to the left of the green book.\n- The gray book is to the left of the blue book, so the gray book must be to the left of both the blue and green books.\n- The green book is to the left of the brown book, so the brown book must be to the right of the green book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to determine the order of the books:\n\n1. Red book (leftmost)\n2. Gray book (since it must be to the left of the blue book)\n3. Blue book (since it must be to the left of the green book)\n4. Green book (since it must be to the left of the brown book)\n5. Brown book (rightmost)\n\nNow, let's check which option matches this order:\n\n- (A) The green book is the second from the left: False, it's fourth.\n- (B) The blue book is the second from the left: False, it's third.\n- (C) The brown book is the second from the left: False, it's fifth.\n- (D) The gray book is the second from the left: True, it's second.\n- (E) The red book is the second from the left: False, it's first.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
