    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The raven is to the right of the owl.\n2. The raven is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the left of the crow.\n4. The robin is the second from the right.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n- Since the raven is the second from the left, the order starts with one bird, then the raven.\n- The robin is the second from the right, so there is one bird to the right of the robin.\n- The raven is to the right of the owl, so the owl must be the first bird.\n- The robin is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be the last bird.\n\nLet's place the birds in order:\n\n1. Owl\n2. Raven\n3. Cardinal\n4. Robin\n5. Crow\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which bird is third from the left:\n\n(A) The owl is the third from the left - Incorrect, the owl is first.\n(B) The crow is the third from the left - Incorrect, the crow is fifth.\n(C) The raven is the third from the left - Incorrect, the raven is second.\n(D) The robin is the third from the left - Incorrect, the robin is fourth.\n(E) The cardinal is the third from the left - Correct, the cardinal is third.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
