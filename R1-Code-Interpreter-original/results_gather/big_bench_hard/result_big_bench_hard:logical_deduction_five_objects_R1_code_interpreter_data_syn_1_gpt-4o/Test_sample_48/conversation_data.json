    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The raven is to the right of the owl.\n2. The raven is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the left of the crow.\n4. The robin is the second from the right.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the raven is the second from the left, the order starts with one bird, then the raven.\n- The raven is to the right of the owl, so the owl must be the leftmost bird.\n- The robin is the second from the right, so there are two birds to the right of the raven.\n- The robin is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be the rightmost bird.\n\nGiven these conditions, the order of the birds from left to right is:\n1. Owl\n2. Raven\n3. Cardinal\n4. Robin\n5. Crow\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is the leftmost:\n- The owl is the leftmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The owl is the leftmost.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
