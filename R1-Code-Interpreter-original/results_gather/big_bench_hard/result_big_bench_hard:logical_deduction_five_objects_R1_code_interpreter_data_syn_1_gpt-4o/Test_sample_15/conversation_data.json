On a shelf, there are five books: a yellow book, a gray book, a red book, a black book, and a white book. The gray book is to the left of the yellow book. The white book is to the left of the red book. The black book is to the right of the red book.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given constraints:\n\n1. The gray book is to the left of the yellow book.\n2. The white book is to the left of the red book.\n3. The black book is to the right of the red book.\n4. The black book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these constraints:\n\n- From constraint 1, we know that the order is: Gray < Yellow.\n- From constraint 2, we know that the order is: White < Red.\n- From constraint 3, we know that the order is: Red < Black.\n- From constraint 4, we know that the order is: Black < Gray.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange these books in order:\n\n1. From constraints 3 and 4, we have: Red < Black < Gray.\n2. From constraint 2, we have: White < Red.\n3. From constraint 1, we have: Gray < Yellow.\n\nCombining all these, we can deduce the order:\n\n- White < Red < Black < Gray < Yellow\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which book is the rightmost:\n\n- (A) The yellow book is the rightmost: This is consistent with our order.\n- (B) The gray book is the rightmost: This is not consistent.\n- (C) The red book is the rightmost: This is not consistent.\n- (D) The black book is the rightmost: This is not consistent.\n- (E) The white book is the rightmost: This is not consistent.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
