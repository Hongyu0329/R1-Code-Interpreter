  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Amy, Eve, Mel, Mya, and Rob. Eve finished last. Rob finished above Mel. Amy finished above Rob. Mya finished third.\nOptions:\n(A) Amy finished third\n(B) Eve finished third\n(C) Mel finished third\n(D) Mya finished third\n(E) Rob finished third\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Eve finished last.\n2. Rob finished above Mel.\n3. Amy finished above Rob.\n4. Mya finished third.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since Mya finished third, we can immediately eliminate options (A), (B), (C), and (E) because they suggest someone else finished third.\n- Therefore, option (D) is the only one that correctly states Mya finished third.\n\nNow, let's determine the complete order:\n\n- Mya is third.\n- Eve is last (fifth).\n- Rob finished above Mel, so Rob is either first or second, and Mel is either second or fourth.\n- Amy finished above Rob, so Amy must be first, and Rob must be second.\n- This leaves Mel in fourth place.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Rob\n3. Mya\n4. Mel\n5. Eve\n\nThus, the correct answer is option (D) Mya finished third.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
