    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The orange book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The green book is the rightmost.\n3. The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n4. The orange book is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the orange book is third from the left, the order starts with two books, then the orange book.\n- The green book is the rightmost, so it must be the fifth book.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the blue book, so the blue book must be to the left of the yellow book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the books:\n\n1. The orange book is third from the left.\n2. The green book is the fifth book.\n3. The yellow book must be to the right of the blue book.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n- The first book could be the blue book.\n- The second book could be the yellow book.\n- The third book is the orange book.\n- The fourth book must be the brown book (since the green book is the fifth).\n\nThis gives us the order: Blue, Yellow, Orange, Brown, Green.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The green book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the fifth.\n(B) The orange book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the third.\n(C) The brown book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the fourth.\n(D) The yellow book is the second from the left - Correct.\n(E) The blue book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the first.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The yellow book is the second from the left.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
