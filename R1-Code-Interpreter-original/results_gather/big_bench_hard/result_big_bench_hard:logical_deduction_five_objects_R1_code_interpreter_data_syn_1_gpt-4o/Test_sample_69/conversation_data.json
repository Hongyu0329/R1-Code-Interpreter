    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given conditions:\n\n1. Oranges are more expensive than mangoes.\n2. Plums are the cheapest.\n3. Apples are less expensive than mangoes.\n4. Pears are more expensive than oranges.\n\nLet's denote the prices of the fruits as follows:\n- P_plum < P_apple < P_mango < P_orange < P_pear\n\nFrom the conditions:\n- Plums are the cheapest, so they are at position 1.\n- Apples are less expensive than mangoes, so they are at position 2 or 3.\n- Oranges are more expensive than mangoes, so they are at position 4 or 5.\n- Pears are more expensive than oranges, so they are at position 5.\n\nNow, let's determine the second-cheapest fruit:\n- Plums are the cheapest (position 1).\n- Apples must be the second-cheapest (position 2) because they are less expensive than mangoes, and plums are already the cheapest.\n\nThus, the apples are the second-cheapest fruit.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the conditions:\n- Plums are the cheapest.\n- Apples are less expensive than mangoes.\n- Oranges are more expensive than mangoes.\n- Pears are more expensive than oranges.\n\nThe order of the fruits based on price is:\n1. Plums\n2. Apples\n3. Mangoes\n4. Oranges\n5. Pears\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The apples are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
