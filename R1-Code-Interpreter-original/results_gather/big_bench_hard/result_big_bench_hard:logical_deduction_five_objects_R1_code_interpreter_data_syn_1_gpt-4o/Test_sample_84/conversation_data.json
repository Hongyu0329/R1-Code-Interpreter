    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the motorcycle.\n2. The bus is the newest.\n3. The tractor is the third-newest.\n4. The station wagon is the second-oldest.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the bus is the newest, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The tractor is the third-newest, so it must be in the 3rd position.\n- The station wagon is the second-oldest, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n- The minivan is older than the motorcycle, which means the minivan must be in the 1st position and the motorcycle in the 4th position.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Minivan\n2. Station Wagon\n3. Tractor\n4. Motorcycle\n5. Bus\n\nNow, let's determine which vehicle is the second-newest. The second-newest vehicle is in the 4th position, which is the motorcycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The motorcycle is the second-newest.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
