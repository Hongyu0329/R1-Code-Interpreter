    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements and identify which bird is the rightmost.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. The robin is to the right of the cardinal.\n2. The cardinal is to the right of the blue jay.\n3. The blue jay is the second from the left.\n4. The crow is the rightmost.\n\nGiven these statements, let's try to arrange the birds:\n\n- Since the blue jay is the second from the left, the possible positions for the blue jay are 2nd.\n- The cardinal must be to the right of the blue jay, so the cardinal can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n- The robin is to the right of the cardinal, so the robin can be in positions 4 or 5.\n- The crow is the rightmost, so the crow must be in position 5.\n\nLet's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Position 1: Unknown\n2. Position 2: Blue Jay\n3. Position 3: Cardinal\n4. Position 4: Robin\n5. Position 5: Crow\n\nNow, we need to place the falcon. The only position left is position 1.\n\nSo, the order from left to right is: Falcon, Blue Jay, Cardinal, Robin, Crow.\n\nThe crow is indeed the rightmost bird.\n\nNow, let's match this with the options provided:\n\n(A) The cardinal is the rightmost\n(B) The crow is the rightmost\n(C) The falcon is the rightmost\n(D) The robin is the rightmost\n(E) The blue jay is the rightmost\n\nThe correct answer is (B) The crow is the rightmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"
