On a shelf, there are five books: a blue book, a red book, a purple book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the right of the gray book. The blue book is the leftmost. The red book is to the left of the gray book.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is the leftmost.\n2. The red book is the third from the left.\n3. The white book is to the right of the gray book.\n4. The red book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the blue book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The red book is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The red book is to the left of the gray book, so the gray book must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The white book is to the right of the gray book, so the white book must be in the fifth position if the gray book is in the fourth position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the order of the books:\n\n1. Blue book\n2. (Unknown)\n3. Red book\n4. Gray book\n5. White book\n\nThe only book left to place is the purple book, which must be in the second position.\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which book is the rightmost:\n\n- The rightmost book is the white book.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
