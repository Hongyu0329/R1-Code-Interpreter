    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given constraints:\n\n1. The cardinal is the rightmost.\n2. The raven is to the left of the owl.\n3. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n4. The hummingbird is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these constraints step by step:\n\n- Since the hummingbird is the third from the left, the positions are as follows: [_, _, Hummingbird, _, _].\n- The cardinal is the rightmost, so it must be in the fifth position: [_, _, Hummingbird, _, Cardinal].\n- The robin is to the right of the hummingbird, so the robin must be in the fourth position: [_, _, Hummingbird, Robin, Cardinal].\n- The raven is to the left of the owl. The only positions left are the first and second. Therefore, the raven must be in the first position and the owl in the second position: [Raven, Owl, Hummingbird, Robin, Cardinal].\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The raven is the leftmost - This is true based on our arrangement.\n(B) The owl is the leftmost - This is false.\n(C) The cardinal is the leftmost - This is false.\n(D) The hummingbird is the leftmost - This is false.\n(E) The robin is the leftmost - This is false.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
