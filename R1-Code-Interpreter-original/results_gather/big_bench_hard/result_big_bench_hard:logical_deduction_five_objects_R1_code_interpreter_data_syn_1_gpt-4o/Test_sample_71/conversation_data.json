A fruit stand sells five fruits: oranges, apples, peaches, cantaloupes, and loquats. The loquats are less expensive than the cantaloupes. The cantaloupes are less expensive than the apples. The oranges are the most expensive. The apples are the third-most expensive.\nOptions:\n(A) The oranges are the second-cheapest\n(B) The apples are the second-cheapest\n(C) The peaches are the second-cheapest\n(D) The cantaloupes are the second-cheapest\n(E) The loquats are the second-cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, from cheapest to most expensive, using the given information:\n\n1. The loquats are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\n2. The cantaloupes are less expensive than the apples.\n3. The oranges are the most expensive.\n4. The apples are the third-most expensive.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n- Since the oranges are the most expensive, they are in the 5th position.\n- The apples are the third-most expensive, so they are in the 3rd position.\n- The loquats are less expensive than the cantaloupes, and the cantaloupes are less expensive than the apples. This means the loquats and cantaloupes must be in the 1st and 2nd positions, respectively.\n- The peaches are not mentioned in the constraints, so they must be in the 4th position.\n\nThus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Loquats\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Apples\n4. Peaches\n5. Oranges\n\nNow, we can determine which fruit is the second-cheapest. The second-cheapest fruit is in the 2nd position, which is the cantaloupes.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The cantaloupes are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
