In an antique car show, there are five vehicles: a hatchback, a bus, a convertible, a tractor, and a minivan. The tractor is older than the bus. The minivan is newer than the bus. The hatchback is the second-newest. The minivan is older than the convertible.\nOptions:\n(A) The hatchback is the second-oldest\n(B) The bus is the second-oldest\n(C) The convertible is the second-oldest\n(D) The tractor is the second-oldest\n(E) The minivan is the second-oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The tractor is older than the bus.\n2. The minivan is newer than the bus.\n3. The hatchback is the second-newest.\n4. The minivan is older than the convertible.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- Since the hatchback is the second-newest, there is only one vehicle newer than it. This means the convertible must be the newest because the minivan is older than the convertible.\n- The order from newest to oldest is: Convertible, Hatchback, Minivan, Bus, Tractor.\n\nNow, let's determine which vehicle is the second-oldest:\n\n- The oldest vehicle is the tractor.\n- The second-oldest vehicle is the bus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the bus is the second-oldest.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
