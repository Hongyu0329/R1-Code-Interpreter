    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the gray book.\n2. The brown book is the third from the left.\n3. The gray book is the second from the right.\n4. The yellow book is to the left of the green book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the gray book is the second from the right, it must be in the fourth position.\n- The brown book is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The green book must be to the left of the gray book, so it can only be in the first or second position.\n- The yellow book must be to the left of the green book, so it must be in the first position if the green book is in the second position.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n1. Yellow book\n2. Green book\n3. Brown book\n4. Gray book\n5. Orange book\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n- The green book is to the left of the gray book.\n- The brown book is the third from the left.\n- The gray book is the second from the right.\n- The yellow book is to the left of the green book.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is the rightmost:\n\n- The orange book is in the fifth position, which is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) The orange book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
