  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Rob, Ada, Dan, Joe, and Mel. Ada finished above Mel. Mel finished above Dan. Joe finished below Dan. Ada finished second.\nOptions:\n(A) Rob finished last\n(B) Ada finished last\n(C) Dan finished last\n(D) Joe finished last\n(E) Mel finished last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Mel.\n2. Mel finished above Dan.\n3. Joe finished below Dan.\n4. Ada finished second.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know Ada is in the second position. Let's denote the positions as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th.\n\n- Ada is 2nd.\n- From condition 1, Mel must be 3rd or 1st.\n- From condition 2, Dan must be below Mel, so Dan is 4th or 5th.\n- From condition 3, Joe must be below Dan, so Joe is 5th if Dan is 4th.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Mel is 3rd, then Dan is 4th, and Joe is 5th. This leaves Rob to be 1st.\n- If Mel is 1st, then Dan is 3rd, and Joe is 4th, which contradicts condition 3.\n\nThus, the only consistent order is:\n1. Rob\n2. Ada\n3. Mel\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nTherefore, Joe finished last.\n\nThe correct option is (D) Joe finished last.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
