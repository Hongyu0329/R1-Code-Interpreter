    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The yellow book is the rightmost.\n2. The black book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The orange book is to the left of the purple book.\n4. The black book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The black book is the second from the left, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n- The orange book must be to the right of the black book, so it cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position.\n- The purple book must be to the right of the orange book, so it cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the books:\n\n1. The black book is in the 2nd position.\n2. The yellow book is in the 5th position.\n3. The orange book must be in the 3rd or 4th position.\n4. The purple book must be in the 4th position if the orange book is in the 3rd position.\n\nLet's place the books:\n\n- 1st position: Red book (since it's the only one left)\n- 2nd position: Black book\n- 3rd position: Orange book\n- 4th position: Purple book\n- 5th position: Yellow book\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The black book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it's second from the left.\n(B) The purple book is the second from the right - Correct, as it is in the 4th position.\n(C) The yellow book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it's the rightmost.\n(D) The orange book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it's in the 3rd position.\n(E) The red book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it's in the 1st position.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
