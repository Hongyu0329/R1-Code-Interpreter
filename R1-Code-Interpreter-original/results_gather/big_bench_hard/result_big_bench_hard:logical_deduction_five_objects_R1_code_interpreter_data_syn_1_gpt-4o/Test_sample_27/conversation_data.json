In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Joe, Eve, Mya, Rob, and Dan. Joe finished below Dan. Mya finished first. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished above Rob.\nOptions:\n(A) Joe finished second-to-last\n(B) Eve finished second-to-last\n(C) Mya finished second-to-last\n(D) Rob finished second-to-last\n(E) Dan finished second-to-last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Mya finished first.\n2. Joe finished below Dan.\n3. Dan finished below Rob.\n4. Eve finished above Rob.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since Mya finished first, the order starts with Mya.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe cannot be second.\n- Dan finished below Rob, so Dan cannot be second or third.\n- Eve finished above Rob, so Eve cannot be last.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to construct the order:\n\n1. Mya\n2. Eve (since Eve must be above Rob and cannot be last)\n3. Rob (since Dan must be below Rob)\n4. Dan (since Joe must be below Dan)\n5. Joe\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) Joe finished second-to-last: This is not true because Joe finished last.\n(B) Eve finished second-to-last: This is not true because Eve finished second.\n(C) Mya finished second-to-last: This is not true because Mya finished first.\n(D) Rob finished second-to-last: This is not true because Rob finished third.\n(E) Dan finished second-to-last: This is true because Dan finished fourth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
