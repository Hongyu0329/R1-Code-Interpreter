  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are five vehicles: a hatchback, a convertible, a tractor, a truck, and a limousine. The tractor is newer than the hatchback. The limousine is the second-newest. The truck is older than the hatchback. The convertible is the second-oldest.\nOptions:\n(A) The hatchback is the second-oldest\n(B) The convertible is the second-oldest\n(C) The tractor is the second-oldest\n(D) The truck is the second-oldest\n(E) The limousine is the second-oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The tractor is newer than the hatchback.\n2. The limousine is the second-newest.\n3. The truck is older than the hatchback.\n4. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it cannot be the second-newest. Therefore, option (B) is correct.\n- The limousine is the second-newest, so it cannot be the second-oldest. Therefore, option (E) is incorrect.\n- The tractor is newer than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the second-oldest. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n- The truck is older than the hatchback, so the truck could potentially be the second-oldest, but since the convertible is already the second-oldest, option (D) is incorrect.\n- The tractor cannot be the second-oldest because it is newer than the hatchback, and the convertible is already the second-oldest. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.\n\nThus, the only consistent option with the given statements is (B) The convertible is the second-oldest.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
