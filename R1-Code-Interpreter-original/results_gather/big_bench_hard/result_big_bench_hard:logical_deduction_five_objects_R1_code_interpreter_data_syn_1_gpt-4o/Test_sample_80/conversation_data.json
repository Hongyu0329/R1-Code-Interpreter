    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and then identify which book is second from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The red book is to the left of the brown book.\n2. The yellow book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The brown book is the second from the left.\n4. The yellow book is to the left of the blue book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the brown book is the second from the left, we can place it in the second position.\n- The red book must be to the left of the brown book, so it must be in the first position.\n- The yellow book must be to the right of the orange book, and since the brown book is already in the second position, the orange book must be in the third position, and the yellow book must be in the fourth position.\n- Finally, the blue book must be to the right of the yellow book, so it must be in the fifth position.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Red, Brown, Orange, Yellow, Blue.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is second from the left:\n\n- The second book from the left is the Brown book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) The brown book is the second from the left.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
