On a shelf, there are five books: a green book, an orange book, a gray book, a yellow book, and a purple book. The green book is the rightmost. The gray book is to the right of the orange book. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book. The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\nOptions:\n(A) The green book is the leftmost\n(B) The orange book is the leftmost\n(C) The gray book is the leftmost\n(D) The yellow book is the leftmost\n(E) The purple book is the leftmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is the rightmost.\n2. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n4. The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the green book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be the rightmost.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be the leftmost.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be the rightmost.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n1. The green book is in position 5.\n2. The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so possible positions for the gray book are 3 or 4.\n3. The purple book must be to the right of the gray book and to the left of the yellow book, so possible positions for the purple book are 2 or 3.\n4. The yellow book must be to the right of the purple book, so possible positions for the yellow book are 3 or 4.\n\nLet's use Python to find the correct order of the books:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nbooks = ['orange', 'gray', 'purple', 'yellow', 'green']\npositions = list(permutations(books))\n\nfor pos in positions:\n    if pos[4] == 'green':  # Green book is the rightmost\n        if pos.index('gray') > pos.index('orange'):  # Gray is to the right of Orange\n            if pos.index('purple') < pos.index('yellow'):  # Purple is to the left of Yellow\n                if pos.index('purple') > pos.index('gray'):  # Purple is to the right of Gray\n                    print(pos)\n                    break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct order of the books.",
    "The code output indicates that the correct order of the books is: orange, gray, purple, yellow, green. \n\nNow, let's determine which book is the leftmost based on this order:\n\n- The first book in the order is the orange book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B) The orange book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"
