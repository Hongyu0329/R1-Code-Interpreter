  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are five birds: a cardinal, a robin, a blue jay, a quail, and a raven. The robin is to the right of the raven. The cardinal is the leftmost. The raven is to the right of the blue jay. The blue jay is the third from the left.\nOptions:\n(A) The cardinal is the leftmost\n(B) The robin is the leftmost\n(C) The blue jay is the leftmost\n(D) The quail is the leftmost\n(E) The raven is the leftmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The cardinal is the leftmost.\n2. The robin is to the right of the raven.\n3. The raven is to the right of the blue jay.\n4. The blue jay is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the cardinal is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The blue jay is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The raven is to the right of the blue jay, so it must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The robin is to the right of the raven, so it must be in the fifth position if the raven is in the fourth position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the order of the birds:\n\n1. Cardinal\n2. Quail (since the blue jay is third, and the raven and robin are fourth and fifth, the quail must be second)\n3. Blue Jay\n4. Raven\n5. Robin\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The cardinal is the leftmost - This is true based on the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
