    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The cardinal is the rightmost.\n2. The raven is to the left of the owl.\n3. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n4. The hummingbird is the third from the left.\n\nLet's denote the positions on the branch as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from left to right.\n\n- Since the cardinal is the rightmost, it must be in position 5.\n- The hummingbird is the third from the left, so it must be in position 3.\n- The robin is to the right of the hummingbird, so it must be in position 4.\n- The raven is to the left of the owl, so the raven must be in position 1 or 2, and the owl must be in position 2 or 1, respectively.\n\nNow, let's try to place the raven and the owl:\n\n- If the raven is in position 1, then the owl must be in position 2.\n- If the raven is in position 2, then the owl must be in position 1.\n\nHowever, since the hummingbird is already in position 3, the only valid configuration is:\n\n1. Raven\n2. Owl\n3. Hummingbird\n4. Robin\n5. Cardinal\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The raven is the second from the left - Incorrect, the raven is first.\n(B) The owl is the second from the left - Correct, the owl is in position 2.\n(C) The cardinal is the second from the left - Incorrect, the cardinal is last.\n(D) The hummingbird is the second from the left - Incorrect, the hummingbird is third.\n(E) The robin is the second from the left - Incorrect, the robin is fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
