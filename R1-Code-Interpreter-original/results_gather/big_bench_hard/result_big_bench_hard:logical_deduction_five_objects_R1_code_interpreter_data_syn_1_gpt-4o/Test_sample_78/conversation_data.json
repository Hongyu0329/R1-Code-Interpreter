In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Mel, Dan, Amy, Joe, and Eve. Amy finished below Dan. Mel finished first. Joe finished above Dan. Eve finished last.\nOptions:\n(A) Mel finished second-to-last\n(B) Dan finished second-to-last\n(C) Amy finished second-to-last\n(D) Joe finished second-to-last\n(E) Eve finished second-to-last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Mel finished first.\n2. Amy finished below Dan.\n3. Joe finished above Dan.\n4. Eve finished last.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Mel finished first, the order starts with Mel.\n- Eve finished last, so the order ends with Eve.\n- Joe finished above Dan, so Joe must be before Dan in the order.\n- Amy finished below Dan, so Amy must be after Dan in the order.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to construct the order:\n\n1. Mel\n2. Joe (since Joe is above Dan)\n3. Dan (since Amy is below Dan)\n4. Amy\n5. Eve\n\nNow, let's check the options to see who finished second-to-last:\n\n- (A) Mel finished second-to-last: Incorrect, Mel finished first.\n- (B) Dan finished second-to-last: Incorrect, Dan finished third.\n- (C) Amy finished second-to-last: Correct, Amy finished fourth.\n- (D) Joe finished second-to-last: Incorrect, Joe finished second.\n- (E) Eve finished second-to-last: Incorrect, Eve finished last.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Amy finished second-to-last.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
