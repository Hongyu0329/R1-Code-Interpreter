    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. There are five books: yellow, green, gray, blue, and orange.\n2. The gray book is to the left of the green book.\n3. The gray book is the second from the right.\n4. The yellow book is to the right of the orange book.\n5. The blue book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the gray book is the second from the right, the possible positions for the gray book are 4th.\n- The gray book is to the left of the green book, so the green book must be in the 5th position.\n- The blue book is the second from the left, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book must be to the left of the yellow book.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. The blue book is in the 2nd position.\n2. The gray book is in the 4th position.\n3. The green book is in the 5th position.\n4. The orange book must be in the 1st position because it is to the left of the yellow book.\n5. The yellow book must be in the 3rd position.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Orange, Blue, Yellow, Gray, Green.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is the leftmost:\n\n- The orange book is in the 1st position, making it the leftmost book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) The orange book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
