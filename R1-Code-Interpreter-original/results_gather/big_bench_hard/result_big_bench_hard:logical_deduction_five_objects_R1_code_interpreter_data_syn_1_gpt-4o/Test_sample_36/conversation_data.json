A fruit stand sells five fruits: pears, mangoes, kiwis, oranges, and peaches. The peaches are more expensive than the mangoes. The oranges are more expensive than the kiwis. The pears are the most expensive. The mangoes are more expensive than the oranges.\nOptions:\n(A) The pears are the cheapest\n(B) The mangoes are the cheapest\n(C) The kiwis are the cheapest\n(D) The oranges are the cheapest\n(E) The peaches are the cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. The peaches are more expensive than the mangoes.\n2. The oranges are more expensive than the kiwis.\n3. The pears are the most expensive.\n4. The mangoes are more expensive than the oranges.\n\nLet's analyze these constraints:\n\n- From constraint 3, we know that pears are the most expensive.\n- From constraint 1, peaches are more expensive than mangoes.\n- From constraint 4, mangoes are more expensive than oranges.\n- From constraint 2, oranges are more expensive than kiwis.\n\nWe can deduce the order of the fruits from the most expensive to the cheapest:\n\n1. Pears (most expensive)\n2. Peaches (since they are more expensive than mangoes)\n3. Mangoes (since they are more expensive than oranges)\n4. Oranges (since they are more expensive than kiwis)\n5. Kiwis (cheapest)\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The pears are the cheapest - Incorrect, pears are the most expensive.\n- (B) The mangoes are the cheapest - Incorrect, mangoes are more expensive than oranges and kiwis.\n- (C) The kiwis are the cheapest - Correct, as per our deduction.\n- (D) The oranges are the cheapest - Incorrect, oranges are more expensive than kiwis.\n- (E) The peaches are the cheapest - Incorrect, peaches are more expensive than mangoes.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
