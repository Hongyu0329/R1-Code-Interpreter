    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is the leftmost.\n2. The red book is the third from the left.\n3. The white book is to the right of the gray book.\n4. The red book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the blue book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The red book is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The gray book must be to the right of the red book, so it cannot be in the first, second, or third positions. It must be in the fourth position.\n- The white book is to the right of the gray book, so it must be in the fifth position.\n- The only remaining position for the purple book is the second position.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Blue, Purple, Red, Gray, White.\n\nNow, we need to determine which book is the second from the right. In the order we have determined, the second from the right is the gray book.\n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the logic is correct:\n\n```python\n# Define the positions of the books\nbooks = [\"Blue\", \"Purple\", \"Red\", \"Gray\", \"White\"]\n\n# Determine the second from the right\nsecond_from_right = books[-2]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(second_from_right)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. The second from the right is the gray book, which corresponds to option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output \"Gray\" confirms that the gray book is indeed the second from the right. Therefore, the correct answer to the problem is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
