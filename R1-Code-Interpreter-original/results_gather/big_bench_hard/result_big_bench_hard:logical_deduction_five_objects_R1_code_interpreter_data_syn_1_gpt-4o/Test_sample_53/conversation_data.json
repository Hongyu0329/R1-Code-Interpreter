    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the sedan.\n2. The tractor is older than the hatchback.\n3. The minivan is the third-newest.\n4. The station wagon is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the minivan is the third-newest, there are two vehicles newer than it. According to condition 4, the station wagon is the second-newest, which means there is one vehicle newer than the station wagon. Therefore, the sedan must be the newest vehicle because it is newer than the minivan and the station wagon is the second-newest.\n\n- The order from newest to oldest for the three vehicles we have information about is: Sedan (newest), Station Wagon (second-newest), Minivan (third-newest).\n\n- Now, we need to place the tractor and the hatchback. According to condition 2, the tractor is older than the hatchback. Therefore, the hatchback must be the fourth-newest, and the tractor must be the oldest.\n\nThe final order from oldest to newest is: Tractor, Hatchback, Minivan, Station Wagon, Sedan.\n\nNow, let's determine which vehicle is the second-oldest:\n\n- The oldest is the Tractor.\n- The second-oldest is the Hatchback.\n\nThus, the answer is option (E) The hatchback is the second-oldest.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
