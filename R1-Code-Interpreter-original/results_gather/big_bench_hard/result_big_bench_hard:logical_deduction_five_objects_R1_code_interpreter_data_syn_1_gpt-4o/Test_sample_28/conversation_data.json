  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Amy, Mel, Rob, Joe, and Ada. Joe finished second. Joe finished below Amy. Mel finished second-to-last. Ada finished last.\nOptions:\n(A) Amy finished first\n(B) Mel finished first\n(C) Rob finished first\n(D) Joe finished first\n(E) Ada finished first\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Joe finished second.\n2. Joe finished below Amy, which means Amy must have finished first.\n3. Mel finished second-to-last, which is fourth place.\n4. Ada finished last, which is fifth place.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- Amy must have finished first because Joe, who finished second, is below her.\n- Joe finished second.\n- Rob must have finished third because Mel and Ada are in the fourth and fifth positions, respectively.\n- Mel finished fourth.\n- Ada finished fifth.\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) Amy finished first - This is consistent with our deduction.\n(B) Mel finished first - This is inconsistent because Mel finished fourth.\n(C) Rob finished first - This is inconsistent because Rob finished third.\n(D) Joe finished first - This is inconsistent because Joe finished second.\n(E) Ada finished first - This is inconsistent because Ada finished last.\n\nThe only option that matches our deduction is (A) Amy finished first.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
