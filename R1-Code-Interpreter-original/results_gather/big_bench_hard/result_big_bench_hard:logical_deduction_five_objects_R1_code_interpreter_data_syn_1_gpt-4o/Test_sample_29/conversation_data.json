    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Mel finished first.\n2. Eve finished last.\n3. Amy finished below Dan.\n4. Joe finished above Dan.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Mel finished first, the order starts with Mel.\n- Eve finished last, so the order ends with Eve.\n- Amy finished below Dan, meaning Dan is ahead of Amy.\n- Joe finished above Dan, meaning Joe is ahead of Dan.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Mel is in the 1st position.\n- Eve is in the 5th position.\n- Joe must be ahead of Dan, and Dan must be ahead of Amy. Therefore, Joe cannot be in the 4th position.\n- The only possible positions for Joe, Dan, and Amy are 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.\n\nLet's try to place Joe, Dan, and Amy in the remaining positions:\n\n- If Joe is 2nd, then Dan can be 3rd, and Amy can be 4th. This satisfies all conditions:\n  - Joe is above Dan.\n  - Dan is above Amy.\n\nThus, the order is: Mel, Joe, Dan, Amy, Eve.\n\nNow, let's determine who finished second:\n\n- Mel is 1st.\n- Joe is 2nd.\n- Dan is 3rd.\n- Amy is 4th.\n- Eve is 5th.\n\nTherefore, Joe finished second.\n\nThe correct option is (D) Joe finished second.\n\n<<<D>>>"
