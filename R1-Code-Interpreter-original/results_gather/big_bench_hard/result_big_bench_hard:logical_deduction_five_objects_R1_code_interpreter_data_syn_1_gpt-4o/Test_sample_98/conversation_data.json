  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are five vehicles: a minivan, a hatchback, a bus, a convertible, and a motorcyle. The hatchback is newer than the convertible. The bus is newer than the hatchback. The bus is older than the motorcyle. The minivan is the newest.\nOptions:\n(A) The minivan is the oldest\n(B) The hatchback is the oldest\n(C) The bus is the oldest\n(D) The convertible is the oldest\n(E) The motorcyle is the oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The hatchback is newer than the convertible.\n2. The bus is newer than the hatchback.\n3. The bus is older than the motorcycle.\n4. The minivan is the newest.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The minivan is the newest, so it is at the end of the list.\n- The bus is newer than the hatchback, and the hatchback is newer than the convertible. Therefore, the order among these three is: convertible, hatchback, bus.\n- The bus is older than the motorcycle, so the motorcycle is newer than the bus.\n\nCombining these deductions, the order from oldest to newest is:\n\n1. Convertible\n2. Hatchback\n3. Bus\n4. Motorcycle\n5. Minivan\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the oldest. According to the order, the convertible is the oldest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D) The convertible is the oldest.\n\n<<<D>>>"
