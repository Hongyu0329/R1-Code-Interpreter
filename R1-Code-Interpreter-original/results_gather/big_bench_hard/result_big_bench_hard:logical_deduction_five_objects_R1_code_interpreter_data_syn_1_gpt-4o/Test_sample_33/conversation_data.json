    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The orange book is to the right of the red book.\n3. The blue book is the rightmost.\n4. The gray book is to the left of the red book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the blue book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the left of the red book, so the red book cannot be in the 1st position.\n- The orange book is to the right of the red book, so the red book cannot be in the 5th position.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the books:\n\n1. The blue book is in position 5.\n2. The orange book must be to the right of the red book, so it can be in position 4 or 5. Since the blue book is in position 5, the orange book must be in position 4.\n3. The red book must be to the left of the orange book, so it can be in position 3.\n4. The gray book must be to the left of the red book, so it can be in position 2.\n5. The yellow book must be to the left of the gray book, so it must be in position 1.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Yellow, Gray, Red, Orange, Blue.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The gray book is the second from the left - This is true.\n(B) The red book is the second from the left - This is false.\n(C) The yellow book is the second from the left - This is false.\n(D) The blue book is the second from the left - This is false.\n(E) The orange book is the second from the left - This is false.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
