  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells five fruits: mangoes, pears, cantaloupes, watermelons, and loquats. The mangoes are more expensive than the loquats. The cantaloupes are more expensive than the mangoes. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes. The pears are the cheapest.\nOptions:\n(A) The mangoes are the second-cheapest\n(B) The pears are the second-cheapest\n(C) The cantaloupes are the second-cheapest\n(D) The watermelons are the second-cheapest\n(E) The loquats are the second-cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. Mangoes are more expensive than loquats.\n2. Cantaloupes are more expensive than mangoes.\n3. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n4. Pears are the cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Since pears are the cheapest, they must be in the first position.\n- Mangoes are more expensive than loquats, so loquats must be cheaper than mangoes.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than mangoes, so cantaloupes must be more expensive than both mangoes and loquats.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, so watermelons must be the most expensive.\n\nGiven these constraints, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n\n1. Pears\n2. Loquats\n3. Mangoes\n4. Cantaloupes\n5. Watermelons\n\nNow, let's determine which fruit is the second-cheapest:\n\n- The second-cheapest fruit is loquats.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
