  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells five fruits: apples, loquats, cantaloupes, watermelons, and kiwis. The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats. The watermelons are less expensive than the kiwis. The loquats are more expensive than the apples. The cantaloupes are the cheapest.\nOptions:\n(A) The apples are the cheapest\n(B) The loquats are the cheapest\n(C) The cantaloupes are the cheapest\n(D) The watermelons are the cheapest\n(E) The kiwis are the cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than loquats.\n2. Watermelons are less expensive than kiwis.\n3. Loquats are more expensive than apples.\n4. Cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that cantaloupes are the cheapest. This directly eliminates options (A), (B), (D), and (E) because they all suggest a different fruit as the cheapest.\n\nNow, let's verify the order of the remaining fruits based on the other statements:\n\n- Since cantaloupes are the cheapest, they are at the bottom of the price list.\n- From statement 3, loquats are more expensive than apples, so apples are cheaper than loquats.\n- From statement 1, watermelons are more expensive than loquats, so loquats are cheaper than watermelons.\n- From statement 2, watermelons are less expensive than kiwis, so watermelons are cheaper than kiwis.\n\nPutting this all together, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Apples\n3. Loquats\n4. Watermelons\n5. Kiwis\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C) because cantaloupes are indeed the cheapest.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
