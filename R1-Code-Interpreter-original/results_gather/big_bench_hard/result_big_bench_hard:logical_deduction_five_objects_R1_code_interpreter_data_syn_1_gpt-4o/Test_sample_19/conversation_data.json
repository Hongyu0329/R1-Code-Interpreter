    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Rob finished below Dan.\n2. Joe finished second.\n3. Joe finished above Eve.\n4. Eve finished above Dan.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know Joe is in the second position. Let's denote the positions as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th.\n\nGiven Joe is second, we have:\n- Joe: 2nd\n\nFrom statement 3, Joe finished above Eve, so Eve cannot be 1st or 2nd. Since Joe is 2nd, Eve must be 3rd or lower.\n\nFrom statement 4, Eve finished above Dan, so Dan cannot be 3rd. Therefore, Dan must be 4th or 5th.\n\nFrom statement 1, Rob finished below Dan, so Rob must be 5th if Dan is 4th, or Rob must be 4th if Dan is 3rd.\n\nLet's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n1. Joe is 2nd.\n2. Eve must be 3rd or 4th.\n3. Dan must be 4th or 5th.\n4. Rob must be below Dan, so Rob is 5th if Dan is 4th.\n\nLet's try to fit these into a possible order:\n\n- If Eve is 3rd, then Dan is 4th, and Rob is 5th. This fits all conditions:\n  - Joe is 2nd.\n  - Eve is 3rd, above Dan.\n  - Dan is 4th, above Rob.\n  - Rob is 5th.\n\nThis leaves Amy as the only golfer who can be 1st.\n\nLet's verify:\n- Joe is 2nd (matches statement 2).\n- Joe is above Eve (matches statement 3).\n- Eve is above Dan (matches statement 4).\n- Rob is below Dan (matches statement 1).\n\nThe order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Eve\n4. Dan\n5. Rob\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n(A) Rob finished second - Incorrect\n(B) Amy finished second - Incorrect\n(C) Joe finished second - Correct\n(D) Eve finished second - Incorrect\n(E) Dan finished second - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
