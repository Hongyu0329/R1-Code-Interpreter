    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and then identify which book is second from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the gray book.\n2. The brown book is the third from the left.\n3. The gray book is the second from the right.\n4. The yellow book is to the left of the green book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the gray book is the second from the right, the order must be: _ _ _ Gray _.\n- The brown book is the third from the left, so the order becomes: _ _ Brown Gray _.\n- The green book is to the left of the gray book, so it must be in one of the first two positions: Green _ Brown Gray _ or _ Green Brown Gray _.\n- The yellow book is to the left of the green book, so the only possible order is: Yellow Green Brown Gray _.\n\nNow, the only book left is the orange book, which must be in the last position: Yellow Green Brown Gray Orange.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Yellow, Green, Brown, Gray, Orange.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is second from the right:\n\n- The order is: Yellow, Green, Brown, Gray, Orange.\n- The second from the right is the Gray book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The gray book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
