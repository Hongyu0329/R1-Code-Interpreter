    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The hawk is to the left of the owl.\n2. The raven is the second from the right.\n3. The robin is to the left of the raven.\n4. The owl is the second from the left.\n\nLet's denote the positions on the branch as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from left to right.\n\n- From condition 4, the owl is in position 2.\n- From condition 1, the hawk must be in position 1 because it is to the left of the owl.\n- From condition 2, the raven is in position 4.\n- From condition 3, the robin must be in position 3 because it is to the left of the raven.\n\nThis leaves position 5 for the crow.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is: Hawk, Owl, Robin, Raven, Crow.\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is the rightmost:\n\n- Position 5 is occupied by the crow.\n\nTherefore, the crow is the rightmost bird.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
