    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the motorcycle.\n2. The bus is the newest.\n3. The tractor is the third-newest.\n4. The station wagon is the second-oldest.\n\nGiven these statements, we can start arranging the vehicles:\n\n- Since the bus is the newest, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The station wagon is the second-oldest, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n- The tractor is the third-newest, which means it is in the 3rd position.\n- The minivan is older than the motorcycle, so the minivan must be in the 1st position, and the motorcycle must be in the 4th position.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n1. Minivan (oldest)\n2. Station wagon\n3. Tractor\n4. Motorcycle\n5. Bus (newest)\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the third-newest. According to our arrangement, the tractor is in the third position from the newest, which matches the given statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The tractor is the third-newest.\n\n<<<A>>>"
