    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n2. The green book is the second from the right.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the white book.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- From condition 2, we know the green book is the second from the right. This means the green book is in the 4th position.\n- From condition 1, the gray book is to the right of the orange book. This means the gray book cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd positions.\n- From condition 3, the brown book is to the right of the white book. This means the white book cannot be in the 4th or 5th positions.\n- From condition 4, the brown book is to the left of the orange book. This means the orange book cannot be in the 1st position.\n\nLet's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- Since the green book is in the 4th position, the 5th position must be occupied by either the gray or the orange book (from condition 1).\n- The brown book must be to the left of the orange book (condition 4), so the brown book cannot be in the 5th position.\n- The white book must be to the left of the brown book (condition 3), so the white book cannot be in the 4th or 5th positions.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. White book\n2. Brown book\n3. Orange book\n4. Green book\n5. Gray book\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n- The green book is the second from the right.\n- The brown book is to the right of the white book.\n- The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is the rightmost:\n\n- The gray book is in the 5th position, which is the rightmost position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
