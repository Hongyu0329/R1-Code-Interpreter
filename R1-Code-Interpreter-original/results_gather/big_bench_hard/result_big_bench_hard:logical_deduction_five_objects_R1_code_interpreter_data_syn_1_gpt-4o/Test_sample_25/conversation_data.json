A fruit stand sells five fruits: watermelons, loquats, pears, plums, and apples. The pears are the second-cheapest. The loquats are more expensive than the pears. The plums are the second-most expensive. The watermelons are the most expensive.\nOptions:\n(A) The watermelons are the third-most expensive\n(B) The loquats are the third-most expensive\n(C) The pears are the third-most expensive\n(D) The plums are the third-most expensive\n(E) The apples are the third-most expensive\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. The pears are the second-cheapest.\n2. The loquats are more expensive than the pears.\n3. The plums are the second-most expensive.\n4. The watermelons are the most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Since the watermelons are the most expensive, they are in the 5th position.\n- The plums are the second-most expensive, so they are in the 4th position.\n- The pears are the second-cheapest, so they are in the 2nd position.\n- The loquats are more expensive than the pears, so they must be in either the 3rd or 4th position. However, since the plums are already in the 4th position, the loquats must be in the 3rd position.\n- This leaves the apples as the cheapest, in the 1st position.\n\nThe order from cheapest to most expensive is: apples, pears, loquats, plums, watermelons.\n\nNow, let's determine which fruit is the third-most expensive:\n\n- 1st: Apples\n- 2nd: Pears\n- 3rd: Loquats\n- 4th: Plums\n- 5th: Watermelons\n\nThe loquats are the third-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The loquats are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
