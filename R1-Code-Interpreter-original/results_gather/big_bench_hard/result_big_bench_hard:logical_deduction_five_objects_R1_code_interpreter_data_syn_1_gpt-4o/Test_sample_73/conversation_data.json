    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The sedan is newer than the station wagon.\n2. The limousine is the newest.\n3. The bus is the second-newest.\n4. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the limousine is the newest, it must be in the last position.\n- The bus is the second-newest, so it must be just before the limousine.\n- The convertible is the second-oldest, so it must be in the second position.\n- The sedan is newer than the station wagon, which means the station wagon must be the oldest.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the order from oldest to newest is:\n\n1. Station wagon\n2. Convertible\n3. Sedan\n4. Bus\n5. Limousine\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The convertible is the newest - Incorrect, as the convertible is the second-oldest.\n- (B) The sedan is the newest - Incorrect, as the sedan is in the middle.\n- (C) The station wagon is the newest - Incorrect, as the station wagon is the oldest.\n- (D) The bus is the newest - Incorrect, as the bus is the second-newest.\n- (E) The limousine is the newest - Correct, as the limousine is indeed the newest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
