    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints:\n\n1. Loquats are more expensive than kiwis.\n2. Pears are more expensive than peaches.\n3. Apples are more expensive than loquats.\n4. Apples are less expensive than peaches.\n\nLet's denote the fruits by their initials: K (kiwis), P (pears), Pe (peaches), L (loquats), A (apples).\n\nFrom the constraints, we can derive the following inequalities:\n\n- L > K (Loquats are more expensive than kiwis)\n- P > Pe (Pears are more expensive than peaches)\n- A > L (Apples are more expensive than loquats)\n- A < Pe (Apples are less expensive than peaches)\n\nWe need to find the order of the fruits from cheapest to most expensive. Let's try to deduce the order:\n\n1. Since L > K and A > L, K must be the cheapest.\n2. Since A < Pe, A cannot be the most expensive, and since P > Pe, P must be the most expensive.\n3. Since A > L, L cannot be the second-cheapest.\n4. Since A < Pe, Pe cannot be the second-cheapest.\n5. Since P > Pe, Pe cannot be the second-cheapest.\n\nThus, the only fruit that can be the second-cheapest is the apples (A).\n\nLet's verify this by arranging the fruits in order:\n\n- K (cheapest)\n- A (second-cheapest)\n- L\n- Pe\n- P (most expensive)\n\nThis order satisfies all the given constraints. Therefore, the apples are the second-cheapest.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer.\n\n<<<E>>>"
