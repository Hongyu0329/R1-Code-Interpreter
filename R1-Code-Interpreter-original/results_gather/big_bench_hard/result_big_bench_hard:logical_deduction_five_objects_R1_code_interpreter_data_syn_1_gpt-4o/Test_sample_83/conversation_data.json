  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Amy, Mel, Rob, Joe, and Ada. Joe finished second. Joe finished below Amy. Mel finished second-to-last. Ada finished last.\nOptions:\n(A) Amy finished second\n(B) Mel finished second\n(C) Rob finished second\n(D) Joe finished second\n(E) Ada finished second\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Joe finished second.\n2. Joe finished below Amy.\n3. Mel finished second-to-last.\n4. Ada finished last.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Joe finished second, the only possible position for Amy that is above Joe is first. Therefore, Amy must have finished first.\n- Mel finished second-to-last, which means Mel finished fourth.\n- Ada finished last, which means Ada finished fifth.\n\nNow, we have the following positions filled:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nThe only position left is third, which must be filled by Rob.\n\nThus, the final order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Rob\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) Amy finished second - Incorrect, Amy finished first.\n(B) Mel finished second - Incorrect, Mel finished fourth.\n(C) Rob finished second - Incorrect, Rob finished third.\n(D) Joe finished second - Correct, Joe finished second.\n(E) Ada finished second - Incorrect, Ada finished fifth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D) Joe finished second.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
