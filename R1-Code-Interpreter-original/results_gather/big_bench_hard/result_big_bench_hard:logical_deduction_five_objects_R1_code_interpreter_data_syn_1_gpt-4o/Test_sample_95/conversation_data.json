    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the third from the left.\n2. The yellow book is to the left of the black book.\n3. The green book is to the left of the purple book.\n4. The blue book is to the left of the green book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the purple book is the third from the left, the order of the books can be represented as: [_, _, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The green book is to the left of the purple book, so it must be in one of the first two positions: [Green, _, Purple, _, _] or [_, Green, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The blue book is to the left of the green book, so it must be in the first position if the green book is in the second position: [Blue, Green, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The yellow book is to the left of the black book. Since the first three positions are occupied by Blue, Green, and Purple, the yellow and black books must be in the last two positions. Therefore, the yellow book must be in the fourth position and the black book in the fifth position: [Blue, Green, Purple, Yellow, Black].\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The blue book is the leftmost - This is consistent with our arrangement.\n(B) The purple book is the leftmost - This is not possible as the purple book is third.\n(C) The yellow book is the leftmost - This is not possible as the yellow book is fourth.\n(D) The black book is the leftmost - This is not possible as the black book is fifth.\n(E) The green book is the leftmost - This is not possible as the green book is second.\n\nThe only option that matches our arrangement is (A).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
