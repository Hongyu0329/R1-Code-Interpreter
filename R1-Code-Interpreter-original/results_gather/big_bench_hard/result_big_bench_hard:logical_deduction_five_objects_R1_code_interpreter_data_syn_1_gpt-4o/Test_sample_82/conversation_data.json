    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n2. Mangoes are less expensive than pears.\n3. Apples are the second-cheapest.\n4. Watermelons are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nLet's analyze these constraints:\n\n- From constraint 3, we know that apples are the second-cheapest. This means there is only one fruit cheaper than apples.\n- From constraint 1, watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes. This implies cantaloupes are cheaper than watermelons.\n- From constraint 4, watermelons are less expensive than mangoes. This implies mangoes are more expensive than watermelons.\n- From constraint 2, mangoes are less expensive than pears. This implies pears are more expensive than mangoes.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n1. Since apples are the second-cheapest, the cheapest fruit must be cantaloupes (as watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes).\n2. Therefore, the order of the cheapest to the second-cheapest is: Cantaloupes, Apples.\n3. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes but less expensive than mangoes, so watermelons must be the third-cheapest.\n4. Mangoes are more expensive than watermelons but less expensive than pears, so mangoes must be the fourth-cheapest.\n5. Pears, being more expensive than mangoes, must be the most expensive.\n\nThus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is: Cantaloupes, Apples, Watermelons, Mangoes, Pears.\n\nNow, let's determine which fruit is the third-most expensive:\n\n- The third-most expensive fruit is Watermelons.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The watermelons are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<A>>>"
