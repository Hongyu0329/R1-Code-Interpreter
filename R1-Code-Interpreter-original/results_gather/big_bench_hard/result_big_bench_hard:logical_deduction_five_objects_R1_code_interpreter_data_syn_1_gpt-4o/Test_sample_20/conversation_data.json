A fruit stand sells five fruits: watermelons, apples, mangoes, pears, and cantaloupes. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes. The mangoes are less expensive than the pears. The apples are the second-cheapest. The watermelons are less expensive than the mangoes.\nOptions:\n(A) The watermelons are the second-cheapest\n(B) The apples are the second-cheapest\n(C) The mangoes are the second-cheapest\n(D) The pears are the second-cheapest\n(E) The cantaloupes are the second-cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given conditions:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n2. Mangoes are less expensive than pears.\n3. Apples are the second-cheapest.\n4. Watermelons are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 3, we know that apples are the second-cheapest. This directly gives us the position of apples in the order.\n- Condition 1 tells us that watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, so cantaloupes cannot be the most expensive.\n- Condition 4 tells us that watermelons are less expensive than mangoes, so mangoes cannot be the cheapest.\n- Condition 2 tells us that mangoes are less expensive than pears, so pears cannot be the cheapest or the second-cheapest.\n\nGiven that apples are the second-cheapest, let's consider the possible orderings:\n\n1. Cantaloupes (cheapest)\n2. Apples (second-cheapest)\n3. Watermelons\n4. Mangoes\n5. Pears (most expensive)\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions:\n- Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n- Mangoes are less expensive than pears.\n- Apples are the second-cheapest.\n- Watermelons are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nNow, let's verify if this order is consistent with the given options:\n\n- (A) The watermelons are the second-cheapest: False\n- (B) The apples are the second-cheapest: True\n- (C) The mangoes are the second-cheapest: False\n- (D) The pears are the second-cheapest: False\n- (E) The cantaloupes are the second-cheapest: False\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
