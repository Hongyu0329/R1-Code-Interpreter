    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Oranges are more expensive than mangoes.\n3. Apples are the third-most expensive.\n4. Pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 3, apples are the third-most expensive. This means there are two fruits more expensive than apples and two fruits less expensive than apples.\n- From statement 1, apples are more expensive than oranges, so oranges cannot be one of the two fruits more expensive than apples.\n- From statement 2, oranges are more expensive than mangoes, so mangoes are less expensive than oranges.\n- From statement 4, pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of their prices:\n\n1. Since apples are the third-most expensive, there must be two fruits more expensive than apples. Let's assume pears and another fruit are more expensive than apples.\n2. Since pears are more expensive than watermelons, pears could be the most expensive.\n3. Oranges cannot be more expensive than apples, so they must be less expensive than apples.\n4. Mangoes are less expensive than oranges.\n\nLet's try the following order based on the constraints:\n- Pears\n- Watermelons\n- Apples\n- Oranges\n- Mangoes\n\nNow, let's verify if this order satisfies all the conditions:\n- Apples are the third-most expensive: Yes, they are third in the list.\n- Apples are more expensive than oranges: Yes, apples are above oranges.\n- Oranges are more expensive than mangoes: Yes, oranges are above mangoes.\n- Pears are more expensive than watermelons: Yes, pears are above watermelons.\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the most expensive fruit is pears.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
