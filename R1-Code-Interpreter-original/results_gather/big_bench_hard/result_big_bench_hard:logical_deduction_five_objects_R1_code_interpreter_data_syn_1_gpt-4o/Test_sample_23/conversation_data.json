  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are five vehicles: a bus, a truck, a motorcyle, a sedan, and a hatchback. The sedan is the second-oldest. The hatchback is newer than the motorcyle. The motorcyle is newer than the sedan. The hatchback is older than the truck.\nOptions:\n(A) The bus is the oldest\n(B) The truck is the oldest\n(C) The motorcyle is the oldest\n(D) The sedan is the oldest\n(E) The hatchback is the oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age, using the given clues:\n\n1. The sedan is the second-oldest.\n2. The hatchback is newer than the motorcycle.\n3. The motorcycle is newer than the sedan.\n4. The hatchback is older than the truck.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the sedan is the second-oldest, there must be one vehicle older than the sedan.\n- The motorcycle is newer than the sedan, so it cannot be the oldest.\n- The hatchback is newer than the motorcycle, so it cannot be the oldest.\n- The truck is newer than the hatchback, so it cannot be the oldest.\n\nGiven these constraints, the only vehicle that can be the oldest is the bus. Let's verify this by arranging the vehicles in order of age:\n\n1. Oldest: Bus\n2. Second-oldest: Sedan\n3. Newer than sedan: Motorcycle\n4. Newer than motorcycle: Hatchback\n5. Newest: Truck\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the bus is the oldest vehicle.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
