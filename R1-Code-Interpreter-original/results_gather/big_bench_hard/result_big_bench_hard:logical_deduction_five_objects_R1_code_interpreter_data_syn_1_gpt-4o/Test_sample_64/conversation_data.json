  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are five books: a gray book, a red book, a purple book, a blue book, and a black book. The red book is to the right of the gray book. The black book is to the left of the blue book. The blue book is to the left of the gray book. The purple book is the second from the right.\nOptions:\n(A) The gray book is the rightmost\n(B) The red book is the rightmost\n(C) The purple book is the rightmost\n(D) The blue book is the rightmost\n(E) The black book is the rightmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The red book is to the right of the gray book.\n2. The black book is to the left of the blue book.\n3. The blue book is to the left of the gray book.\n4. The purple book is the second from the right.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 4, we know the purple book is the second from the right, so it cannot be the rightmost book.\n- From condition 1, the red book is to the right of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be the rightmost.\n- From condition 3, the blue book is to the left of the gray book, so the blue book cannot be the rightmost.\n- From condition 2, the black book is to the left of the blue book, so the black book cannot be the rightmost.\n\nGiven these deductions, the only book that can be the rightmost is the red book.\n\nLet's verify this by arranging the books:\n\n1. The purple book is second from the right, so the arrangement is: _ _ _ Purple _\n2. The red book is to the right of the gray book, so the arrangement is: _ Gray _ Purple Red\n3. The blue book is to the left of the gray book, so the arrangement is: _ Blue Gray Purple Red\n4. The black book is to the left of the blue book, so the arrangement is: Black Blue Gray Purple Red\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the red book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
