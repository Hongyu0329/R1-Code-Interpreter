On a branch, there are five birds: a falcon, a raven, a cardinal, a hawk, and a crow. The cardinal is the second from the right. The hawk is to the right of the falcon. The raven is the second from the left.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given clues:\n\n1. The cardinal is the second from the right.\n2. The hawk is to the right of the falcon.\n3. The raven is the second from the left.\n4. The crow is the rightmost.\n\nLet's analyze these clues step by step:\n\n- Since the crow is the rightmost, it occupies the 5th position.\n- The cardinal is the second from the right, so it occupies the 4th position.\n- The raven is the second from the left, so it occupies the 2nd position.\n- The hawk is to the right of the falcon, which means the falcon cannot be in the 4th or 5th positions. Since the raven is in the 2nd position, the falcon must be in the 1st position, and the hawk must be in the 3rd position.\n\nNow, let's list the positions:\n1. Falcon\n2. Raven\n3. Hawk\n4. Cardinal\n5. Crow\n\nBased on this arrangement, the falcon is the leftmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The falcon is the leftmost.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
