    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions and then identify which book is third from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n2. The green book is the second from the right.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the white book.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n\nWe have five books: white, green, brown, gray, and orange. Let's denote their positions as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from left to right.\n\nFrom condition 2, the green book is the second from the right, which means it is in position 4.\n\nNow, let's use the other conditions to determine the positions of the remaining books:\n\n- Condition 1: The gray book is to the right of the orange book. This means the orange book cannot be in position 5.\n- Condition 3: The brown book is to the right of the white book. This means the white book cannot be in position 5.\n- Condition 4: The brown book is to the left of the orange book. This means the orange book cannot be in position 1.\n\nLet's try to place the books in the positions:\n\n1. The green book is in position 4.\n2. The gray book must be in position 5 (since it is to the right of the orange book).\n3. The orange book must be in position 3 (since it is to the left of the gray book and the right of the brown book).\n4. The brown book must be in position 2 (since it is to the left of the orange book and to the right of the white book).\n5. The white book must be in position 1 (since it is to the left of the brown book).\n\nNow, let's verify the order:\n- Position 1: White book\n- Position 2: Brown book\n- Position 3: Orange book\n- Position 4: Green book\n- Position 5: Gray book\n\nThe book in the third position from the left is the orange book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
