    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is the rightmost.\n2. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n4. The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the green book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be in the 1st position.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n\nLet's try to find a possible arrangement:\n\n1. The green book is in position 5.\n2. The gray book must be to the right of the orange book and to the left of the purple book. Therefore, the gray book can be in position 3 or 4.\n3. The purple book must be to the right of the gray book and to the left of the yellow book. Therefore, the purple book can be in position 2 or 3.\n4. The yellow book must be to the right of the purple book, so it can be in position 4.\n\nLet's try to arrange them:\n\n- If the gray book is in position 3, the purple book can be in position 4, and the yellow book in position 2. But this contradicts the condition that the purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n- If the gray book is in position 2, the purple book can be in position 3, and the yellow book in position 4. This satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Orange, Gray, Purple, Yellow, Green.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is second from the right:\n\n- The order is: Orange, Gray, Purple, Yellow, Green.\n- The second from the right is the Yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The yellow book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
