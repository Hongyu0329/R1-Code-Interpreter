In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Amy, Mel, Rob, Joe, and Ada. Joe finished second. Joe finished below Amy. Mel finished second-to-last. Ada finished last.\nOptions:\n(A) Amy finished last\n(B) Mel finished last\n(C) Rob finished last\n(D) Joe finished last\n(E) Ada finished last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Joe finished second.\n2. Joe finished below Amy, which means Amy finished first.\n3. Mel finished second-to-last, which is fourth place.\n4. Ada finished last, which is fifth place.\n\nGiven these positions, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- Amy finished 1st.\n- Joe finished 2nd.\n- Rob must be 3rd because he is the only one left unplaced.\n- Mel finished 4th.\n- Ada finished 5th.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) Amy finished last - Incorrect, Amy finished 1st.\n- (B) Mel finished last - Incorrect, Mel finished 4th.\n- (C) Rob finished last - Incorrect, Rob finished 3rd.\n- (D) Joe finished last - Incorrect, Joe finished 2nd.\n- (E) Ada finished last - Correct, Ada finished 5th.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E) Ada finished last>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
