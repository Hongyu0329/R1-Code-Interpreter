In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Eve, Eli, Joe, Rob, and Mya. Rob finished above Mya. Eve finished first. Joe finished above Eli. Joe finished below Mya.\nOptions:\n(A) Eve finished second-to-last\n(B) Eli finished second-to-last\n(C) Joe finished second-to-last\n(D) Rob finished second-to-last\n(E) Mya finished second-to-last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Eve finished first.\n2. Rob finished above Mya.\n3. Joe finished above Eli.\n4. Joe finished below Mya.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since Eve finished first, the order starts with Eve.\n- Rob finished above Mya, so Rob must be placed before Mya.\n- Joe finished above Eli, so Joe must be placed before Eli.\n- Joe finished below Mya, so Mya must be placed before Joe.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to construct the order:\n\n1. Eve\n2. Rob (since Rob must be above Mya and Joe)\n3. Mya (since Mya must be above Joe)\n4. Joe (since Joe must be above Eli)\n5. Eli\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions with this order:\n- Eve is first, which satisfies condition 1.\n- Rob is above Mya, satisfying condition 2.\n- Joe is above Eli, satisfying condition 3.\n- Joe is below Mya, satisfying condition 4.\n\nThe order is consistent with all the conditions. Now, we need to determine who finished second-to-last, which is the fourth position in the order.\n\nThe fourth position is occupied by Joe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C) Joe finished second-to-last>>>"
