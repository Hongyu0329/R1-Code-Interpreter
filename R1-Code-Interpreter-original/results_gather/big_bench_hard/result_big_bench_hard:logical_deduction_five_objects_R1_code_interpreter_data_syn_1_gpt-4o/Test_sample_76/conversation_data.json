  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are five birds: an owl, a robin, a blue jay, a hawk, and a hummingbird. The owl is the second from the right. The robin is the second from the left. The robin is to the right of the blue jay. The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\nOptions:\n(A) The owl is the third from the left\n(B) The robin is the third from the left\n(C) The blue jay is the third from the left\n(D) The hawk is the third from the left\n(E) The hummingbird is the third from the left\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The owl is the second from the right.\n2. The robin is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the right of the blue jay.\n4. The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n\nLet's denote the positions on the branch as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from left to right.\n\n- From condition 1, the owl is in position 4.\n- From condition 2, the robin is in position 2.\n- From condition 3, since the robin is to the right of the blue jay, the blue jay must be in position 1.\n- From condition 4, the hummingbird is to the right of the hawk, so the hawk must be in position 3, and the hummingbird in position 5.\n\nNow, let's list the positions:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Owl\n5. Hummingbird\n\nWe need to determine which bird is third from the left. Based on the positions, the hawk is in position 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The hawk is the third from the left.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
