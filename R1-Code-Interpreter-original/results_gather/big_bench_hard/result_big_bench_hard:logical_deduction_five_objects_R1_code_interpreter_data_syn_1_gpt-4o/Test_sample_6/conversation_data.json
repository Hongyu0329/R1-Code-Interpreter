    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The convertible is newer than the truck.\n2. The minivan is the newest.\n3. The bus is the third-newest.\n4. The truck is newer than the sedan.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 2, we know the minivan is the newest.\n- From statement 3, the bus is the third-newest.\n- From statement 1, the convertible is newer than the truck.\n- From statement 4, the truck is newer than the sedan.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the order:\n\n1. Minivan (newest)\n2. Convertible (since it is newer than the truck and the bus is third-newest)\n3. Bus (third-newest)\n4. Truck (newer than the sedan)\n5. Sedan (oldest)\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The convertible is the newest - Incorrect, as the minivan is the newest.\n- (B) The bus is the newest - Incorrect, as the minivan is the newest.\n- (C) The minivan is the newest - Correct, as per the given statements.\n- (D) The truck is the newest - Incorrect, as the minivan is the newest.\n- (E) The sedan is the newest - Incorrect, as the minivan is the newest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
