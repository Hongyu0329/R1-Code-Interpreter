On a shelf, there are five books: a green book, a blue book, a white book, a purple book, and a yellow book. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book. The white book is to the left of the yellow book. The blue book is the second from the right.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The white book is to the left of the yellow book.\n3. The blue book is the second from the right.\n4. The purple book is the second from the left.\n\nWe have five books: green, blue, white, purple, and yellow. Let's denote their positions as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from left to right.\n\nGiven that the blue book is second from the right, it must be in position 4. The purple book is second from the left, so it must be in position 2.\n\nNow, let's place the yellow book. Since the blue book is to the right of the yellow book, the yellow book cannot be in position 4 or 5. The yellow book must be in position 3 because the white book is to the left of the yellow book, and the only available position for the white book is position 1.\n\nFinally, the green book must be in the remaining position, which is position 5.\n\nLet's summarize the positions:\n1. White book\n2. Purple book\n3. Yellow book\n4. Blue book\n5. Green book\n\nNow, we can determine which book is third from the left. The book in position 3 is the yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
