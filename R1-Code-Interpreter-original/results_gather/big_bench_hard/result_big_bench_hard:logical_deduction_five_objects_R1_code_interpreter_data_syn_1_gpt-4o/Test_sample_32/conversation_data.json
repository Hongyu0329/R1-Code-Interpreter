  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Dan, Mel, Ana, Eli, and Rob. Rob finished above Mel. Mel finished second. Ana finished above Eli. Dan finished last.\nOptions:\n(A) Dan finished second-to-last\n(B) Mel finished second-to-last\n(C) Ana finished second-to-last\n(D) Eli finished second-to-last\n(E) Rob finished second-to-last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Rob finished above Mel.\n2. Mel finished second.\n3. Ana finished above Eli.\n4. Dan finished last.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 2, we know Mel finished second.\n- From statement 4, Dan finished last, so Dan is in the 5th position.\n- From statement 1, Rob finished above Mel, but since Mel is second, Rob must be first.\n- From statement 3, Ana finished above Eli. Since Rob is first and Mel is second, Ana must be third, and Eli must be fourth.\n\nThus, the order of finish is:\n1. Rob\n2. Mel\n3. Ana\n4. Eli\n5. Dan\n\nNow, we need to determine who finished second-to-last, which is the 4th position. From the order above, Eli finished in the 4th position.\n\nTherefore, Eli finished second-to-last.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
