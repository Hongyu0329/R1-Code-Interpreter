  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are five vehicles: a sedan, a convertible, a station wagon, a bus, and a motorcyle. The sedan is the second-newest. The station wagon is newer than the convertible. The sedan is older than the motorcyle. The bus is the oldest.\nOptions:\n(A) The sedan is the oldest\n(B) The convertible is the oldest\n(C) The station wagon is the oldest\n(D) The bus is the oldest\n(E) The motorcyle is the oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The sedan is the second-newest.\n2. The station wagon is newer than the convertible.\n3. The sedan is older than the motorcycle.\n4. The bus is the oldest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 4, we know the bus is the oldest.\n- From statement 1, the sedan is the second-newest, so it cannot be the oldest.\n- From statement 3, the sedan is older than the motorcycle, so the motorcycle is newer than the sedan.\n- From statement 2, the station wagon is newer than the convertible.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the vehicles:\n\n1. Bus (oldest)\n2. Convertible\n3. Station Wagon\n4. Sedan (second-newest)\n5. Motorcycle (newest)\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The sedan is the oldest - Incorrect, the bus is the oldest.\n(B) The convertible is the oldest - Incorrect, the bus is the oldest.\n(C) The station wagon is the oldest - Incorrect, the bus is the oldest.\n(D) The bus is the oldest - Correct, as per the given statement.\n(E) The motorcycle is the oldest - Incorrect, the bus is the oldest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
