    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. The tractor is newer than the hatchback.\n2. The limousine is the second-newest.\n3. The truck is older than the hatchback.\n4. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since the limousine is the second-newest, there is only one vehicle newer than it. Therefore, the limousine cannot be the oldest.\n- The convertible is the second-oldest, meaning there is only one vehicle older than it.\n- The tractor is newer than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the newest.\n- The truck is older than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the oldest.\n\nLet's try to arrange the vehicles based on these deductions:\n\n1. The oldest vehicle must be older than the convertible (second-oldest). Therefore, the oldest vehicle is either the truck or the hatchback.\n2. Since the truck is older than the hatchback, the truck must be the oldest.\n3. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n4. The hatchback is older than the tractor, so the hatchback comes next.\n5. The limousine is the second-newest.\n6. The tractor is the newest.\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is: Truck, Convertible, Hatchback, Limousine, Tractor.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options given:\n\n(A) The hatchback is the oldest - Incorrect\n(B) The convertible is the oldest - Incorrect\n(C) The tractor is the oldest - Incorrect\n(D) The truck is the oldest - Correct\n(E) The limousine is the oldest - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The truck is the oldest.\n\n<<<D>>>"
