In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Ada, Eli, Amy, Joe, and Mel. Ada finished above Eli. Amy finished below Mel. Ada finished second. Mel finished below Eli.\nOptions:\n(A) Ada finished third\n(B) Eli finished third\n(C) Amy finished third\n(D) Joe finished third\n(E) Mel finished third\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Ada finished above Eli.\n2. Amy finished below Mel.\n3. Ada finished second.\n4. Mel finished below Eli.\n\nFrom these statements, we can start constructing the order:\n\n- Since Ada finished second, we know her position is fixed at 2nd.\n- Ada finished above Eli, so Eli cannot be 1st or 2nd. Therefore, Eli must be 3rd, 4th, or 5th.\n- Mel finished below Eli, so Mel cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. Therefore, Mel must be 4th or 5th.\n- Amy finished below Mel, so Amy cannot be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Therefore, Amy must be 5th.\n- Since Amy is 5th, Mel must be 4th.\n- Since Mel is 4th, Eli must be 3rd.\n\nNow, we have the following order:\n\n1. Joe (since Ada is 2nd and Eli is 3rd, Joe must be 1st)\n2. Ada\n3. Eli\n4. Mel\n5. Amy\n\nBased on this order, Eli finished third. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.
