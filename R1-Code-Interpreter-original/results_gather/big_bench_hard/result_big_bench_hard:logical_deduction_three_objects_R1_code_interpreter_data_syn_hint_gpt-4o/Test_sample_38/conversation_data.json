    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the birds.\n\n1. We have three birds: a hawk, a crow, and a raven.\n2. The raven is to the right of the hawk.\n3. The crow is the rightmost bird.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n- Since the crow is the rightmost, it must be in the third position.\n- The raven is to the right of the hawk, which means the hawk cannot be in the third position. Therefore, the hawk must be in the first position.\n- This leaves the raven to be in the second position.\n\nSo, the order from left to right is: Hawk, Raven, Crow.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The hawk is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the hawk is the first from the left.\n(B) The crow is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the crow is the third from the left.\n(C) The raven is the second from the left - This is correct because the raven is indeed in the second position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
