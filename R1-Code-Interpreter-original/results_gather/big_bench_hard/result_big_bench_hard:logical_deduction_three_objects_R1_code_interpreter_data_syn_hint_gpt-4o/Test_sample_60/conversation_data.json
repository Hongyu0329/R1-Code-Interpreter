    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age. We have three vehicles: a motorcycle, a minivan, and a tractor. The information given is:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n2. The minivan is the second-newest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the minivan is not the oldest or the newest; it is in the middle. Therefore, the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest must be:\n\n- Oldest\n- Minivan (second-newest)\n- Newest\n\nNow, let's use statement 1: \"The minivan is older than the tractor.\" This means the tractor cannot be the oldest. Therefore, the only possibility is:\n\n- Oldest: Motorcycle\n- Second-newest: Minivan\n- Newest: Tractor\n\nThus, the minivan is indeed the second-newest, which matches option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
