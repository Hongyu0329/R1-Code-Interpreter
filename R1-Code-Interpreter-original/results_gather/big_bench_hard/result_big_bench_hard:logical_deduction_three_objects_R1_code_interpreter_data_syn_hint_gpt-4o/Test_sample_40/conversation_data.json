    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: loquats, mangoes, and apples. The given conditions are:\n\n1. Mangoes are more expensive than apples.\n2. Loquats are more expensive than mangoes.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 1, we know: Mangoes > Apples\n- From condition 2, we know: Loquats > Mangoes\n\nCombining these two conditions, we can deduce the following order from most expensive to least expensive:\n\nLoquats > Mangoes > Apples\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-most expensive. According to the order we derived:\n\n- Loquats are the most expensive.\n- Mangoes are the second-most expensive.\n- Apples are the least expensive.\n\nTherefore, the mangoes are the second-most expensive fruit.\n\nThe correct option is (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
