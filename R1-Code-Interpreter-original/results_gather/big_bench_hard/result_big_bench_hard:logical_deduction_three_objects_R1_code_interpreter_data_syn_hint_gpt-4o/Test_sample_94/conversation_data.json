    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given statements:\n\n1. The orange book is to the left of the white book.\n2. The purple book is the rightmost.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- Option (A): The orange book is the leftmost.\n  - If the orange book is the leftmost, then the order could be: Orange, White, Purple. This satisfies both conditions: the orange book is to the left of the white book, and the purple book is the rightmost.\n\n- Option (B): The white book is the leftmost.\n  - If the white book is the leftmost, then the order would be: White, Orange, Purple. This does not satisfy the condition that the orange book is to the left of the white book.\n\n- Option (C): The purple book is the leftmost.\n  - If the purple book is the leftmost, then the order would be: Purple, Orange, White. This does not satisfy the condition that the purple book is the rightmost.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option (A) satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
