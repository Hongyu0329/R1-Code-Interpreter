    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which bird is second from the left.\n\n1. We have three birds: a hawk, a cardinal, and a falcon.\n2. The hawk is to the left of the cardinal.\n3. The hawk is the second from the left.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that the hawk is the second bird from the left. This directly matches option (A).\n\nLet's verify this with the other statements:\n- If the hawk is second from the left, then the bird to the left of the hawk must be the falcon, as the hawk is to the left of the cardinal.\n- Therefore, the order from left to right is: Falcon, Hawk, Cardinal.\n\nThis order satisfies all the given conditions:\n- The hawk is to the left of the cardinal.\n- The hawk is the second from the left.\n\nThus, the correct option is (A) The hawk is the second from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
