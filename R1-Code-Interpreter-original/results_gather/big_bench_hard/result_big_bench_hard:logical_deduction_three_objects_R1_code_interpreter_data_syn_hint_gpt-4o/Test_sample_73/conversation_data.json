    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: kiwis, loquats, and cantaloupes. The statements given are:\n\n1. The kiwis are less expensive than the loquats.\n2. The cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the price order between kiwis and loquats is: kiwis < loquats.\n- From statement 2, we know that the price order between cantaloupes and kiwis is: cantaloupes < kiwis.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can deduce the following order of prices:\n\ncantaloupes < kiwis < loquats\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-most expensive. In the order we derived, the second-most expensive fruit is the one that is in the middle of the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n\nThe correct option is (A) The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
