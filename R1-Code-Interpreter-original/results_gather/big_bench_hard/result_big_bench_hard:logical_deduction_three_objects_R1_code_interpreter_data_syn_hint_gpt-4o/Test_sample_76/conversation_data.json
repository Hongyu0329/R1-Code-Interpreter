    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Eve finished below Eli.\n2. Eve finished above Mya.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Eli finished above Eve. Therefore, Eli did not finish last.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Eve finished above Mya. Therefore, Mya finished below Eve.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can deduce the order of finishing from highest to lowest as follows:\n- Eli\n- Eve\n- Mya\n\nThus, Mya finished last.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) Mya finished last.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
