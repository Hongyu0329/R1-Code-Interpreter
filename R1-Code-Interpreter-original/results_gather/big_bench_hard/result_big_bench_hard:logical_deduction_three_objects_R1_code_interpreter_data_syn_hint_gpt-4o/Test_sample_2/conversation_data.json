    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is the rightmost.\n2. The orange book is the leftmost.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The orange book is on the leftmost position.\n- The blue book is on the rightmost position.\n\nSince there are only three books, the red book must be in the middle position, which is the second from the left.\n\nTherefore, the red book is the second from the left.\n\nThe correct option is (C) The red book is the second from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
