    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age, from newest to oldest.\n\n1. We know from the statement that the minivan is newer than the truck. This means:\n   - Minivan > Truck (in terms of being newer)\n\n2. We also know that the station wagon is newer than the minivan. This means:\n   - Station Wagon > Minivan\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can deduce the following order from newest to oldest:\n- Station Wagon > Minivan > Truck\n\nBased on this order, the station wagon is the newest vehicle among the three.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(A) The station wagon is the newest\n\n<<<answer>>>"
