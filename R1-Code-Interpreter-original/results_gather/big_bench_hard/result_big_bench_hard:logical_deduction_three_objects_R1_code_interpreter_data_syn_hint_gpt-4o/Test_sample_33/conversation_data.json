    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given statements and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the orange book.\n\n1. We have three books: red, blue, and orange.\n2. The red book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The orange book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n- Since the orange book is the second from the left, it must be in the middle position.\n- The red book is to the left of the orange book, so the red book must be in the first position.\n- This leaves the blue book to be in the third position.\n\nThe order of the books from left to right is: Red, Orange, Blue.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The red book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the red book is the first from the left.\n(B) The blue book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the blue book is the third from the left.\n(C) The orange book is the second from the left - This is correct as per the given statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
