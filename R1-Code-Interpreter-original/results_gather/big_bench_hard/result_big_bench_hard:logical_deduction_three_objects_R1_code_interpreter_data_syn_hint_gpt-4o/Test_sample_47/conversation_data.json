    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Ana.\n2. Mel finished below Ana.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Ada finished above Ana, Ada must have a better (lower) position than Ana.\n- Since Mel finished below Ana, Mel must have a worse (higher) position than Ana.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible order is:\n1. Ada\n2. Ana\n3. Mel\n\nTherefore, Ada finished first.\n\nThe correct option is (C) Ada finished first.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
