    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The convertible is older than the tractor.\n2. The hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know:\n- Convertible > Tractor (in terms of age, where \">\" means \"older than\")\n\nFrom statement 2, we know:\n- Hatchback is the second-newest, which means it is neither the oldest nor the newest.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, let's analyze the possible orderings:\n\n- If the hatchback is the second-newest, it cannot be the oldest. Therefore, it must be in the middle position.\n- Since the convertible is older than the tractor, the convertible cannot be the newest. Therefore, the convertible must be the oldest.\n- This leaves the tractor as the newest.\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Convertible\n2. Hatchback\n3. Tractor\n\nTherefore, the tractor is the newest, and the hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(A) The hatchback is the second-newest\n\n<<<answer>>>"
