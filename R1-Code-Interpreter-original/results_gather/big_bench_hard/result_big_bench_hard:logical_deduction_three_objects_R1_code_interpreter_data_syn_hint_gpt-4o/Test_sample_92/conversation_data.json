    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements about the ages of the vehicles:\n\n1. The sedan is older than the tractor.\n2. The bus is older than the sedan.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer:\n- Sedan > Tractor (in terms of age)\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer:\n- Bus > Sedan (in terms of age)\n\nNow, let's determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to youngest based on these statements:\n\n- Since the bus is older than the sedan, and the sedan is older than the tractor, the order from oldest to youngest is: Bus > Sedan > Tractor.\n\nGiven this order, we can conclude that the bus is the oldest vehicle among the three.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) The bus is the oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
