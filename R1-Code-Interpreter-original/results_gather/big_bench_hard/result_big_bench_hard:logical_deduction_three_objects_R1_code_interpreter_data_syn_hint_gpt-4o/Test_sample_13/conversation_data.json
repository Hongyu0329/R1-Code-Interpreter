    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age. We have three vehicles: a minivan, a bus, and a sedan. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The minivan is newer than the sedan.\n2. The minivan is older than the bus.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that the sedan is the oldest among the three vehicles because the minivan is newer than the sedan.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that the bus is the newest among the three vehicles because the minivan is older than the bus.\n\nTherefore, the order from oldest to newest is: Sedan, Minivan, Bus.\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the second-newest. Based on the order we derived, the minivan is the second-newest.\n\nThus, the correct option is (A) The minivan is the second-newest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
