    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Eve finished below Amy.\n2. Eve finished above Joe.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Amy finished above Eve. This means Amy did not finish last.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Eve finished above Joe. This means Joe did not finish above Eve.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- Since Eve is below Amy and above Joe, the order must be: Amy, Eve, Joe.\n\nTherefore, Amy finished first.\n\nThe correct option is (C) Amy finished first.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
