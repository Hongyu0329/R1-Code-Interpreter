    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Mya finished below Ada.\n2. Mel finished above Ada.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following order:\n\n- Mel finished above Ada, so Mel is not in the second position; he must be first.\n- Mya finished below Ada, so Mya is not in the second position; she must be third.\n- This leaves Ada in the second position.\n\nTherefore, the order is: Mel (1st), Ada (2nd), Mya (3rd).\n\nBased on this order, the correct option is:\n\n(A) Ada finished second\n\n<<<answer>>>"
