    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird.\n2. The raven is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- If the raven is the second from the left, then the order must be:\n  - First position: Hummingbird\n  - Second position: Raven\n  - Third position: Blue Jay\n\nThis order satisfies both conditions:\n- The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird.\n- The raven is the second from the left.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) The hummingbird is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the raven is the second from the left.\n(B) The blue jay is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the raven is the second from the left.\n(C) The raven is the second from the left - This is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
