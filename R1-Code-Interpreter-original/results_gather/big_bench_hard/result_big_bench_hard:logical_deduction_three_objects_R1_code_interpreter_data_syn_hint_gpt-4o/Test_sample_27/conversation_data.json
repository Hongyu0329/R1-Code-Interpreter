    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The convertible is older than the tractor.\n2. The hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the hatchback is the second-newest, it cannot be the oldest. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n- The convertible is older than the tractor, which means the convertible cannot be the newest. Therefore, the tractor must be the newest.\n- If the tractor is the newest, then the hatchback, being the second-newest, must be older than the tractor but younger than the convertible.\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is: Convertible, Hatchback, Tractor.\n\nTherefore, the convertible is the oldest.\n\nThe correct option is (B) The convertible is the oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
