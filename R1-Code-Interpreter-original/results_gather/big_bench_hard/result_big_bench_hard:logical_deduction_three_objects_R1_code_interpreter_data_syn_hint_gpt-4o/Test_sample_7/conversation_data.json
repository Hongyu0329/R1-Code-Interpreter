    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Rob finished below Mel.\n2. Mel finished below Eve.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- Eve finished above Mel, and Mel finished above Rob.\n\nThis implies the order from first to last is: Eve, Mel, Rob.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the given options:\n\n- (A) Eve finished first: This is consistent with the order we deduced.\n- (B) Rob finished first: This is inconsistent because Rob finished last.\n- (C) Mel finished first: This is inconsistent because Mel finished second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A) Eve finished first.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
