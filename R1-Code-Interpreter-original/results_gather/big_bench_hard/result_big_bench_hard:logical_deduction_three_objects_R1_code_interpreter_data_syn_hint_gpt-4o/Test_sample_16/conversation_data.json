    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the statements in the paragraph.\n\n1. We know that the watermelons are less expensive than the kiwis. This means that the kiwis are more expensive than the watermelons.\n\n2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive. This means that there is one fruit that is more expensive than the kiwis.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can deduce the following order of prices from least to most expensive:\n- Watermelons (least expensive)\n- Kiwis (second-most expensive)\n- Mangoes (most expensive)\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) The mangoes are the most expensive - This matches our deduction.\n(B) The watermelons are the most expensive - This contradicts our deduction.\n(C) The kiwis are the most expensive - This contradicts our deduction.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The mangoes are the most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
