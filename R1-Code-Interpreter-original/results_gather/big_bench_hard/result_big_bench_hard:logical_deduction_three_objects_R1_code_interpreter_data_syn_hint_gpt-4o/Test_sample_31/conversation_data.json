    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Mel finished above Amy.\n2. Dan finished below Amy.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Mel's position is higher than Amy's. This means Mel cannot be last, and Amy cannot be first.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Dan's position is lower than Amy's. This means Dan cannot be first, and Amy cannot be last.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's consider the possible positions:\n\n- If Mel is first, then Amy must be second (since Mel is above Amy), and Dan must be third (since Dan is below Amy). This arrangement satisfies both conditions.\n\n- If Amy were first, it would contradict statement 1, as Mel must be above Amy.\n\n- If Dan were first, it would contradict statement 2, as Dan must be below Amy.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent arrangement is Mel finishing first, Amy finishing second, and Dan finishing third.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Mel finished first"
