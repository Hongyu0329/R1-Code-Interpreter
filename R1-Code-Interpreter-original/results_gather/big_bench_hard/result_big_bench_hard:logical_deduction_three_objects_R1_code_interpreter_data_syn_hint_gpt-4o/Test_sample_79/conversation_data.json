    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Mya finished below Ada.\n2. Mel finished above Ada.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Ada finished above Mya. Therefore, Mya cannot be first.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Mel finished above Ada. Therefore, Ada cannot be first.\n\nSince Mel finished above Ada and Ada finished above Mya, the only logical order is:\n\n1. Mel\n2. Ada\n3. Mya\n\nThus, Mel finished first.\n\nThe correct option is (B) Mel finished first.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
