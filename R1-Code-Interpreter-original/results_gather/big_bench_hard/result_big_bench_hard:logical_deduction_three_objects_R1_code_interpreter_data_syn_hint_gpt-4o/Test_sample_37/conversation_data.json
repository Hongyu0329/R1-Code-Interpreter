    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay.\n2. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 2, we know the order between the quail and the blue jay: Quail -> Blue Jay.\n- From statement 1, we know the order between the blue jay and the falcon: Blue Jay -> Falcon.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can deduce the complete order of the birds on the branch:\n\nQuail -> Blue Jay -> Falcon\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is the rightmost. In the order we deduced, the falcon is the last bird, making it the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) The falcon is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
