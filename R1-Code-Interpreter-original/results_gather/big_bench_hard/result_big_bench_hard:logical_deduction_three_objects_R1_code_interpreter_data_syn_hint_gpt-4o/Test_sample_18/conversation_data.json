    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Mya finished below Ada.\n2. Mel finished above Ada.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Ada finished above Mya. Therefore, Mya did not finish first.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Mel finished above Ada. Therefore, Ada did not finish first.\n\nSince Mel finished above Ada, and Ada finished above Mya, the order of finishing is:\n\n1. Mel\n2. Ada\n3. Mya\n\nThus, Mya finished last.\n\nThe correct option is (C) Mya finished last.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
