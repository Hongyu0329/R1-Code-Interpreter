    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Eve finished above Amy.\n2. Eli finished below Amy.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Eve finished above Amy, Eve cannot be in the last position. Therefore, Eve must be either first or second.\n- Since Eli finished below Amy, Eli cannot be in the first or second position. Therefore, Eli must be in the last position.\n\nGiven that Eli is in the last position, the only possible order for the golfers is:\n\n1. Eve\n2. Amy\n3. Eli\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) Amy finished second: This matches our determined order.\n- (B) Eli finished second: This does not match, as Eli is last.\n- (C) Eve finished second: This does not match, as Eve is first.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A) Amy finished second.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
