    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given statements:\n\n1. The red book is the rightmost.\n2. The blue book is to the right of the green book.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the red book is at the far right position.\n- From statement 2, the blue book must be positioned to the right of the green book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible arrangement of the books from left to right is:\n\n- Green book\n- Blue book\n- Red book\n\nThis arrangement satisfies both conditions: the red book is the rightmost, and the blue book is to the right of the green book.\n\nNow, let's match this arrangement with the options provided:\n\n(A) The green book is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the red book is the rightmost.\n(B) The red book is the rightmost - This is correct as per the arrangement.\n(C) The blue book is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the red book is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The red book is the rightmost"
