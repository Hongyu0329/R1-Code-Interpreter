    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct position of each bird on the branch based on the given statements and then match it with the options provided.\n\n1. We have three birds: an owl, a crow, and a cardinal.\n2. The crow is to the left of the owl.\n3. The owl is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the owl is the second from the left, it occupies the middle position.\n- The crow is to the left of the owl, which means the crow must be in the first position.\n- This leaves the cardinal to be in the third position, as it is the only position left.\n\nNow, let's match this arrangement with the options:\n\n- Option (A): The owl is the second from the left. This matches our arrangement.\n- Option (B): The crow is the second from the left. This does not match our arrangement.\n- Option (C): The cardinal is the second from the left. This does not match our arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
