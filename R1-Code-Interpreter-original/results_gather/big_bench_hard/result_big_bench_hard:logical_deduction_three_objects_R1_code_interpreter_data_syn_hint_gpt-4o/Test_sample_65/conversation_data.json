    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age, given the statements:\n\n1. The tractor is the second-newest.\n2. The minivan is newer than the convertible.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the tractor is the second-newest, it means there is one vehicle newer than the tractor and one vehicle older than the tractor.\n- The minivan is newer than the convertible, which means the convertible is the oldest among the three.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce the order from oldest to newest:\n\n1. Convertible (oldest)\n2. Tractor (second-newest)\n3. Minivan (newest)\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The tractor is the second-newest: This is consistent with our deduction.\n- (B) The convertible is the second-newest: This is incorrect because the convertible is the oldest.\n- (C) The minivan is the second-newest: This is incorrect because the minivan is the newest.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
