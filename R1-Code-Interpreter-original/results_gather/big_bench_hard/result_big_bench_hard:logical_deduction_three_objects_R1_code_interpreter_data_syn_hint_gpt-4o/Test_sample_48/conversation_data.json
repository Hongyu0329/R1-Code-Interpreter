    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age. We have three vehicles: a sedan, a tractor, and a bus. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The sedan is older than the tractor.\n2. The bus is older than the sedan.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order based on age:\n\n- The bus is the oldest because it is older than the sedan, which in turn is older than the tractor.\n- The sedan is older than the tractor, making the tractor the newest.\n\nTherefore, the order from oldest to newest is: Bus, Sedan, Tractor.\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the second-newest. Since the order is Bus (oldest), Sedan, Tractor (newest), the second-newest vehicle is the Sedan.\n\nThus, the correct option is (A) The sedan is the second-newest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
