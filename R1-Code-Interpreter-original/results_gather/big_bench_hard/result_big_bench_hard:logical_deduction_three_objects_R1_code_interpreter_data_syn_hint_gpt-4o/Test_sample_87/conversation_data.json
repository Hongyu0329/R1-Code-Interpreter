    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the statements in the paragraph.\n\n1. We know that the peaches are the cheapest.\n2. The mangoes are less expensive than the pears.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order of prices from cheapest to most expensive:\n\n- Peaches (cheapest)\n- Mangoes\n- Pears (most expensive)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The peaches are the most expensive - This is incorrect because the peaches are the cheapest.\n\n(B) The pears are the most expensive - This is correct because, based on the order, pears are indeed the most expensive.\n\n(C) The mangoes are the most expensive - This is incorrect because the mangoes are less expensive than the pears.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
