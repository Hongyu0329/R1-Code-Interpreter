    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which fruit is the cheapest based on the given statements. Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. The loquats are the cheapest.\n2. The plums are less expensive than the apples.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that loquats are the cheapest among the three fruits. This directly matches option (C).\n\nStatement 2 tells us that plums are less expensive than apples, which means apples cannot be the cheapest. This rules out option (B).\n\nSince the loquats are already identified as the cheapest, option (A) is also incorrect because it states that plums are the cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C) because it aligns with the information given in the paragraph.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
