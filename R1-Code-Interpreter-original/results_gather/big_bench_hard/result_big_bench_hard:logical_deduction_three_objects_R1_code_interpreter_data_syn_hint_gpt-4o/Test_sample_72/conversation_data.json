    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements about the prices of the fruits:\n\n1. The kiwis are less expensive than the loquats.\n2. The cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer:\n- Loquats are more expensive than kiwis.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer:\n- Kiwis are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n\nCombining these two inferences, we get the following order of prices from least to most expensive:\n- Cantaloupes < Kiwis < Loquats\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The kiwis are the most expensive: This is incorrect because loquats are more expensive than kiwis.\n\n(B) The loquats are the most expensive: This is correct because loquats are more expensive than both kiwis and cantaloupes.\n\n(C) The cantaloupes are the most expensive: This is incorrect because cantaloupes are the least expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
