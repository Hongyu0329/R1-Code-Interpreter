    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: oranges, watermelons, and pears. Let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. The oranges are the second-most expensive.\n2. The pears are more expensive than the watermelons.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that oranges are neither the cheapest nor the most expensive. Therefore, oranges are in the middle in terms of price.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that pears are more expensive than watermelons. This means that watermelons are the cheapest.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can deduce the following order from cheapest to most expensive:\n\n- Watermelons (cheapest)\n- Oranges (second-most expensive)\n- Pears (most expensive)\n\nTherefore, the pears are the most expensive.\n\nThe correct option is (C) The pears are the most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
