    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: pears, plums, and kiwis, and the following information:\n\n1. The pears are less expensive than the plums.\n2. The kiwis are less expensive than the pears.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know:\n- Pears < Plums\n\nFrom statement 2, we know:\n- Kiwis < Pears\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can deduce the order of the fruits from least expensive to most expensive:\n- Kiwis < Pears < Plums\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-most expensive. According to the order:\n- Kiwis are the least expensive.\n- Pears are the second-most expensive.\n- Plums are the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The pears are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
