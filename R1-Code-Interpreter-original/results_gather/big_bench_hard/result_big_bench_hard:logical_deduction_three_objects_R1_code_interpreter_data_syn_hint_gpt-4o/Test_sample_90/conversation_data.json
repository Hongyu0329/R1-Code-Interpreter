    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given information.\n\n1. We know that Eli finished last. This means Eli is in the third position.\n2. Mya finished second. This means Mya is in the second position.\n3. Since there are only three golfers, and we have already placed Eli and Mya in the last and second positions respectively, Eve must be the one who finished first.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Eve finished first.\n\n<<<C) Eve finished first>>>"
