    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements and then match it with the options provided.\n\n1. We have three birds: a robin, an owl, and a hawk.\n2. The robin is to the right of the hawk. This means the hawk is to the left of the robin.\n3. The owl is the leftmost. This means the owl is positioned at the far left.\n\nGiven these conditions, the order of the birds from left to right is:\n- Owl (leftmost)\n- Hawk\n- Robin (rightmost)\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n- (A) The robin is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the robin is the rightmost.\n- (B) The owl is the leftmost: This is correct because the owl is indeed the leftmost.\n- (C) The hawk is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the hawk is in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
