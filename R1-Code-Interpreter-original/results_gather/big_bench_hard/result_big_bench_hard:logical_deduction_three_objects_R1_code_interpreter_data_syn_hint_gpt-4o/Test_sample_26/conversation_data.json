    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the most expensive.\n\n1. We have three fruits: peaches, pears, and mangoes.\n2. The statement \"The mangoes are less expensive than the peaches\" implies that the price of mangoes is less than the price of peaches. So, we have:\n   - Mangoes < Peaches\n\n3. The statement \"The mangoes are more expensive than the pears\" implies that the price of mangoes is more than the price of pears. So, we have:\n   - Mangoes > Pears\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order of prices:\n- Pears < Mangoes < Peaches\n\nGiven this order, the peaches are the most expensive fruit among the three.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The peaches are the most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
