    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: plums, apples, and loquats. The statements given are:\n\n1. The loquats are the cheapest.\n2. The plums are less expensive than the apples.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that loquats have the lowest price among the three fruits. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that plums are cheaper than apples, which means apples are more expensive than plums.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits in order of increasing price based on these statements:\n\n- Loquats (cheapest)\n- Plums\n- Apples (most expensive)\n\nGiven this order, we can determine which fruit is the most expensive. The apples are the most expensive among the three fruits.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The apples are the most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
