    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The red book is the rightmost.\n2. The blue book is to the right of the green book.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- Option (A): The green book is the second from the left.\n  - If the green book is second from the left, then the order could be: [X, Green, X, Red]. Since the blue book must be to the right of the green book, the blue book would be the third book. Thus, the order is [Green, Blue, Red]. This satisfies all conditions.\n\n- Option (B): The red book is the second from the left.\n  - This contradicts the condition that the red book is the rightmost. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\n- Option (C): The blue book is the second from the left.\n  - If the blue book is second from the left, then the order could be: [X, Blue, X, Red]. The green book must be to the left of the blue book, so the order would be [Green, Blue, Red]. This also satisfies all conditions.\n\nBoth options (A) and (C) satisfy the conditions, but since we are asked to choose one, and option (A) is the first one that satisfies the conditions, we will select it.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
