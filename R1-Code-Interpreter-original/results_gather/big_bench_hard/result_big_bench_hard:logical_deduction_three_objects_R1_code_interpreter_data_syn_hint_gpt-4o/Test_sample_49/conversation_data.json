    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n2. The green book is to the left of the brown book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the green book is to the left of the brown book, the green book cannot be in the second or third position. Therefore, the green book must be in the first position.\n- The brown book is to the left of the orange book, so the brown book cannot be in the third position. Since the green book is already in the first position, the brown book must be in the second position.\n- This leaves the orange book to be in the third position.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Green, Brown, Orange.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) The green book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the green book is the first from the left.\n(B) The brown book is the second from the left - This is correct because the brown book is indeed in the second position.\n(C) The orange book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the orange book is in the third position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The brown book is the second from the left"
