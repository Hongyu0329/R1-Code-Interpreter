    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The robin is to the right of the crow.\n2. The robin is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that the crow is not the rightmost bird because the robin is to its right. Therefore, the crow must be to the left of the robin.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that the blue jay is not to the left of the robin because the robin is to its left. Therefore, the blue jay must be to the right of the robin.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can deduce the order of the birds from left to right:\n\nCrow -> Robin -> Blue Jay\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is the rightmost:\n\n- The crow is the leftmost.\n- The robin is in the middle.\n- The blue jay is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The blue jay is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The blue jay is the rightmost"
