We have three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a green book.\n2. The green book is the leftmost.\n3. The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the green book is the leftmost, so it must be the first book on the shelf.\n\nFrom statement 3, the orange book is to the left of the blue book, which means the orange book must come before the blue book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the order of the books from left to right is:\n- Green book\n- Orange book\n- Blue book\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n- (A) The blue book is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the green book is the leftmost.\n- (B) The orange book is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the green book is the leftmost.\n- (C) The green book is the leftmost: This is correct based on the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
