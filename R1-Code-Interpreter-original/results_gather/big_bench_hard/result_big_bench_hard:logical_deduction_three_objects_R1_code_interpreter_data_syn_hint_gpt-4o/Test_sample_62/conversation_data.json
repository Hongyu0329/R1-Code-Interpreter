    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given statements:\n\n1. The orange book is the leftmost.\n2. The gray book is to the right of the brown book.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the orange book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the brown book, which means the brown book must be to the left of the gray book.\n\nGiven there are only three books, the possible order that satisfies both conditions is:\n\n1. Orange book\n2. Brown book\n3. Gray book\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The gray book is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the gray book is third.\n- (B) The orange book is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the orange book is first.\n- (C) The brown book is the second from the left: This is correct because the brown book is indeed in the second position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
