    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The motorcycle is the oldest.\n2. The bus is newer than the tractor.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the motorcycle is the oldest, so it cannot be the newest. This eliminates option (A).\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the bus is newer than the tractor. This means the tractor is older than the bus.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, the order from oldest to newest is:\n- Oldest: Motorcycle\n- Middle: Tractor\n- Newest: Bus\n\nTherefore, the bus is the newest vehicle.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
