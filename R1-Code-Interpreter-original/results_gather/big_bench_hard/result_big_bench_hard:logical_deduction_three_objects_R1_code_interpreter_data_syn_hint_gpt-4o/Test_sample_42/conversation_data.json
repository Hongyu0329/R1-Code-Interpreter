    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The loquats are less expensive than the apples.\n2. The peaches are more expensive than the apples.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer:\n- Loquats < Apples\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer:\n- Apples < Peaches\n\nCombining both statements, we get the order:\n- Loquats < Apples < Peaches\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the most expensive based on this order. Clearly, the peaches are the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(B) The peaches are the most expensive\n\n<<<answer>>>"
