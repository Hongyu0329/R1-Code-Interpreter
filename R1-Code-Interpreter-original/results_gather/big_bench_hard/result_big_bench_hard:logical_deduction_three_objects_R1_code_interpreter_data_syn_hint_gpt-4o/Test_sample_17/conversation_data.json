    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given statements. We have three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a red book. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The blue book is the rightmost.\n2. The orange book is the leftmost.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The orange book is on the leftmost side.\n- The blue book is on the rightmost side.\n- The red book must be in the middle since it is neither the leftmost nor the rightmost.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The blue book is the rightmost - This is consistent with the given statements.\n(B) The orange book is the rightmost - This contradicts the given statement that the orange book is the leftmost.\n(C) The red book is the rightmost - This contradicts the given statement that the blue book is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The blue book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
