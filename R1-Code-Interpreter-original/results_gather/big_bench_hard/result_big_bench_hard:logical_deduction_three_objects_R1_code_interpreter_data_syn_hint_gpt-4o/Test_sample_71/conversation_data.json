    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Joe finished first.\n2. Amy finished above Eve.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Joe is in the first position.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Amy is above Eve, which means Amy cannot be in the last position.\n\nGiven these two statements, the only possible order is:\n- Joe in 1st place\n- Amy in 2nd place\n- Eve in 3rd place\n\nTherefore, Eve finished last.\n\nThe correct option is (B) Eve finished last.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
