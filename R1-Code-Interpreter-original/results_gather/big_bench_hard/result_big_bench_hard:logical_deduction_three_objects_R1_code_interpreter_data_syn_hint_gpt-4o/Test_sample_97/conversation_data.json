    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: cantaloupes, oranges, and watermelons. The statements given are:\n\n1. The oranges are the most expensive.\n2. The cantaloupes are more expensive than the watermelons.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that oranges are at the top of the price list. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that cantaloupes are more expensive than watermelons, which means cantaloupes are above watermelons in the price list.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can arrange the fruits in order of their prices from most expensive to least expensive:\n\n1. Oranges\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Watermelons\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-most expensive. According to the order we derived, cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
