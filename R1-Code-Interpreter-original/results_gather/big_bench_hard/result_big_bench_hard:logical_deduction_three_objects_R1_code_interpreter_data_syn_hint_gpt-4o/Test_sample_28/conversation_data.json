    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the positions of the three birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird.\n2. The raven is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the raven is the second from the left, it cannot be the leftmost or the rightmost bird. Therefore, the raven must be in the middle position.\n- Given that the blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird, the hummingbird cannot be the rightmost bird.\n\nNow, let's arrange the birds based on these conditions:\n\n- The leftmost position must be occupied by the hummingbird because the blue jay is to the right of it.\n- The middle position is occupied by the raven, as it is the second from the left.\n- The rightmost position is occupied by the blue jay, as it is to the right of the hummingbird.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is: Hummingbird, Raven, Blue Jay.\n\nBased on this arrangement, the rightmost bird is the blue jay.\n\nThus, the correct option is (B) The blue jay is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
