    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.\n2. The oranges are less expensive than the plums.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have:\n- Plums < Mangoes\n\nFrom statement 2, we have:\n- Oranges < Plums\n\nCombining these two statements, we can deduce the following order based on price:\n- Oranges < Plums < Mangoes\n\nThis means that oranges are the least expensive, plums are more expensive than oranges but less expensive than mangoes, and mangoes are the most expensive.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n(A) The oranges are the most expensive - This is incorrect because oranges are the least expensive.\n(B) The mangoes are the most expensive - This is correct because mangoes are more expensive than both plums and oranges.\n(C) The plums are the most expensive - This is incorrect because plums are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The mangoes are the most expensive"
