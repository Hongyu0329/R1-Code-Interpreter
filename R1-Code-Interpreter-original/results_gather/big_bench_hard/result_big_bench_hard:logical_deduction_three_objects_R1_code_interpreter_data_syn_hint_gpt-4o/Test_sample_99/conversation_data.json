    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Ana.\n2. Mel finished below Ana.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 1, we know that Ada did not finish last, and she finished in a position higher than Ana. Therefore, Ada could be either 1st or 2nd.\n- From condition 2, we know that Mel finished below Ana. Therefore, Mel cannot be 1st, and he must be either 2nd or 3rd.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Ada is 1st, then Ana must be 2nd (since Ada is above Ana), and Mel must be 3rd (since Mel is below Ana). In this scenario, Mel finishes last.\n- If Ada is 2nd, then Ana must be 3rd (since Ada is above Ana), and Mel must be 1st. However, this contradicts the condition that Mel is below Ana. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only consistent scenario is that Ada is 1st, Ana is 2nd, and Mel is 3rd. Therefore, Mel finished last.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B) Mel finished last.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
