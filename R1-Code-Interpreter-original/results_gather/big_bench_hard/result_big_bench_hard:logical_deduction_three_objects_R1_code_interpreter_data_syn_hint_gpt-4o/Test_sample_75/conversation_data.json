    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The black book is to the left of the purple book.\n2. The purple book is to the left of the white book.\n\nLet's analyze the possible orderings:\n\n- Since the black book is to the left of the purple book, the black book cannot be the rightmost.\n- Since the purple book is to the left of the white book, the purple book cannot be the rightmost.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible order that satisfies both conditions is:\n\n1. Black book\n2. Purple book\n3. White book\n\nFrom this order, we can see that the black book is the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The black book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The black book is the leftmost"
