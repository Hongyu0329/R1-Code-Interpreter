    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: loquats, watermelons, and cantaloupes. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n2. The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the watermelons are the second-most expensive, they cannot be the most expensive or the least expensive. This means the watermelons are in the middle position in terms of price.\n\n- The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes, which means loquats cannot be the least expensive.\n\nGiven these two statements, the only logical order that satisfies both conditions is:\n\n1. Loquats (most expensive)\n2. Watermelons (second-most expensive)\n3. Cantaloupes (least expensive)\n\nTherefore, the loquats are the most expensive.\n\nThe correct option is (A) The loquats are the most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
