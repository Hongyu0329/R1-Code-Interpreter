    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n2. The minivan is the second-newest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the minivan is not the oldest or the newest; it is in the middle position in terms of age. \n\nGiven statement 1, the minivan is older than the tractor, which means the tractor must be the newest because the minivan cannot be the newest (as per statement 2).\n\nTherefore, the order from oldest to newest is:\n- Oldest: Motorcycle\n- Second-newest: Minivan\n- Newest: Tractor\n\nThus, the correct option is (C) The tractor is the newest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
