    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n2. The cardinal is to the left of the hawk.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the hummingbird is to the right of the hawk, the order cannot be \"hawk, hummingbird\" but must be \"hawk, hummingbird\" or \"cardinal, hawk, hummingbird\".\n- Since the cardinal is to the left of the hawk, the order cannot be \"hawk, cardinal\" but must be \"cardinal, hawk\" or \"cardinal, hawk, hummingbird\".\n\nCombining these two conditions, the only possible order that satisfies both conditions is \"cardinal, hawk, hummingbird\".\n\nTherefore, the hummingbird is the rightmost bird.\n\nThe correct option is (C) The hummingbird is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
