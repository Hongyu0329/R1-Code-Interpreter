    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n2. The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The orange book must be to the left of the blue book.\n- The blue book must be to the left of the yellow book.\n\nThis implies the order is: Orange Book, Blue Book, Yellow Book.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The orange book is the leftmost - This is consistent with our order.\n(B) The blue book is the leftmost - This is not consistent, as the orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n(C) The yellow book is the leftmost - This is not consistent, as both the orange and blue books are to the left of the yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
