    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative pricing of the three fruits: loquats, mangoes, and apples, based on the given statements.\n\n1. The mangoes are more expensive than the apples.\n   - This implies: Mangoes > Apples\n\n2. The loquats are more expensive than the mangoes.\n   - This implies: Loquats > Mangoes\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order of prices:\n- Loquats > Mangoes > Apples\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- (A) The loquats are the most expensive: This is consistent with our deduction.\n- (B) The mangoes are the most expensive: This is not consistent, as loquats are more expensive than mangoes.\n- (C) The apples are the most expensive: This is not consistent, as both loquats and mangoes are more expensive than apples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
