    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The robin is to the right of the crow.\n2. The robin is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the crow is to the left of the robin.\n- From statement 2, we know that the robin is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nGiven these two conditions, the only possible order for the birds from left to right is: Crow, Robin, Blue Jay.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The robin is the second from the left: This is true because the robin is indeed in the middle position between the crow and the blue jay.\n\n(B) The blue jay is the second from the left: This is false because the blue jay is on the far right.\n\n(C) The crow is the second from the left: This is false because the crow is on the far left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
