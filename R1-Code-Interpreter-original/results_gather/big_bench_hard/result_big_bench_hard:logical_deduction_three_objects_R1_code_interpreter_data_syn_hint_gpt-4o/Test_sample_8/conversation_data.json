    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given statements and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the second book from the left.\n\n1. We have three books: orange, yellow, and blue.\n2. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n3. The orange book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n- Since the orange book is the second from the left, it must be in the middle position.\n- The blue book is to the right of the yellow book, which means the yellow book must be to the left of the blue book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible arrangement of the books is:\n- Yellow book (leftmost)\n- Orange book (middle)\n- Blue book (rightmost)\n\nNow, let's match this arrangement with the options provided:\n\n(A) The orange book is the second from the left - This is true based on our arrangement.\n(B) The yellow book is the second from the left - This is false; the yellow book is the first from the left.\n(C) The blue book is the second from the left - This is false; the blue book is the third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
