    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the statements:\n\n1. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n2. The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- Option (A): The loquats are the cheapest.\n  - If loquats were the cheapest, then the order would be: loquats < cantaloupes < watermelons. This contradicts statement 2, which says loquats are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n\n- Option (B): The watermelons are the cheapest.\n  - If watermelons were the cheapest, then the order would be: watermelons < cantaloupes < loquats. This contradicts statement 1, which says watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n\n- Option (C): The cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n  - If cantaloupes were the cheapest, then the order would be: cantaloupes < watermelons < loquats. This satisfies both statements: watermelons are the second-most expensive, and loquats are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies both statements is (C).\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) The cantaloupes are the cheapest"
