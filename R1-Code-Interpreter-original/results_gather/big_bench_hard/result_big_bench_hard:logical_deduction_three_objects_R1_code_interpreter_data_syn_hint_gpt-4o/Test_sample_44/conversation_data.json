    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: oranges, mangoes, and plums. The given conditions are:\n\n1. The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.\n2. The oranges are less expensive than the plums.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 1, we know: Plums < Mangoes\n- From condition 2, we know: Oranges < Plums\n\nCombining these two conditions, we can deduce the following order based on increasing price:\n\nOranges < Plums < Mangoes\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The oranges are the second-most expensive: This is incorrect because oranges are the least expensive.\n\n(B) The mangoes are the second-most expensive: This is incorrect because mangoes are the most expensive.\n\n(C) The plums are the second-most expensive: This is correct because plums are more expensive than oranges but less expensive than mangoes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
