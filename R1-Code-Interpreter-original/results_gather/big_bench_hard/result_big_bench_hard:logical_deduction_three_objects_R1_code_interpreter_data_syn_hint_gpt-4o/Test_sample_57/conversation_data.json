    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay.\n2. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The quail is the leftmost because the blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n- The blue jay is in the middle because it is to the right of the quail and to the left of the falcon.\n- The falcon is the rightmost because it is to the right of the blue jay.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is: Quail, Blue Jay, Falcon.\n\nBased on this order, the quail is the leftmost bird.\n\nThus, the correct option is (B) The quail is the leftmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
