    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age, given the statements:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n2. The minivan is the second-newest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the minivan is not the oldest, and it is not the newest. Therefore, it must be in the middle in terms of age.\n\nGiven statement 1, the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest must be:\n\n- Oldest: ?\n- Middle: Minivan\n- Newest: Tractor\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the oldest. The options are:\n\n(A) The motorcycle is the oldest\n(B) The minivan is the oldest\n(C) The tractor is the oldest\n\nSince the minivan is the second-newest, it cannot be the oldest, so option (B) is incorrect. The tractor is the newest, so it cannot be the oldest, making option (C) incorrect. Therefore, the only possibility left is:\n\n(A) The motorcycle is the oldest\n\nThus, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>A"
