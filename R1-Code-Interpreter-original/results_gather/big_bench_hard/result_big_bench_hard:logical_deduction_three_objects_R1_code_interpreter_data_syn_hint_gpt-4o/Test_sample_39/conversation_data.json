    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given statements and then match it with the options provided.\n\n1. We have three books: a brown book, a yellow book, and an orange book.\n2. The yellow book is the leftmost. This means the yellow book is in the first position.\n3. The orange book is to the right of the brown book. This means the brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the order:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n- The brown book must be to the left of the orange book, so the brown book is in the second position, and the orange book is in the third position.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Yellow, Brown, Orange.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options:\n\n(A) The brown book is the leftmost - This is incorrect because the yellow book is the leftmost.\n(B) The yellow book is the leftmost - This is correct as per the given condition.\n(C) The orange book is the leftmost - This is incorrect because the yellow book is the leftmost.\n\nThe correct option is (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
