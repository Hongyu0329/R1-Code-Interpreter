    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue jay is to the right of the falcon.\n2. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- If the blue jay is to the right of the falcon, then the falcon cannot be the rightmost bird.\n- If the hummingbird is to the left of the falcon, then the falcon cannot be the leftmost bird.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible arrangement of the birds from left to right is:\n\nHummingbird, Falcon, Blue Jay\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The blue jay is the second from the left: In our arrangement, the blue jay is the rightmost bird, so this is incorrect.\n\n(B) The falcon is the second from the left: In our arrangement, the falcon is indeed the second bird from the left, so this is correct.\n\n(C) The hummingbird is the second from the left: In our arrangement, the hummingbird is the leftmost bird, so this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The falcon is the second from the left"
