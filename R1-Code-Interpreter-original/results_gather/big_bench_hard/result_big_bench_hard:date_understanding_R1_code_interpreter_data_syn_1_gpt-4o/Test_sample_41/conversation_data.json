    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week from the correct date, which is 6/19/2019. We can do this by adding 7 days to the date 6/19/2019.\n\nLet's calculate the date one week from 6/19/2019 using Python's `datetime` module.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Correct date according to John\ncorrect_date = datetime.strptime(\"06/19/2019\", \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n# Calculate the date one week later\none_week_later = correct_date + timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_later.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the date one week from 6/19/2019. Let's see the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the date one week from 6/19/2019 is 06/26/2019. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 06/19/2019  \n(B) 06/24/2019  \n(C) 08/26/2019  \n(D) 06/25/2019  \n(E) 06/26/2019  \n(F) 07/03/2019  \n\nThe correct option is (E) 06/26/2019.\n\n<<<E>>>"
