    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of \"yesterday\" given that \"tomorrow\" is 11/12/2019. \n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - If tomorrow is 11/12/2019, then today must be 11/11/2019.\n   - Therefore, yesterday would be one day before today, which is 11/10/2019.\n\n2. **Matching with Options:**\n   - We need to find which option matches the date 11/10/2019.\n\nLet's check the options:\n- (A) 11/10/2076\n- (B) 11/10/2019\n- (C) 09/10/2019\n- (D) 11/06/2019\n- (E) 11/11/2019\n- (F) 11/17/2019\n\nThe correct option that matches 11/10/2019 is (B).\n\nTherefore, the answer is option (B).\n\n<<<11/10/2019>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tomorrow is 11/12/2019.
