    "To determine the date of the day before September 9, 1909, we need to subtract one day from this date. The month of September has 30 days, so subtracting one day from September 9, 1909, should result in September 8, 1909.\n\nLet's verify this by using Python to calculate the date one day before September 9, 1909.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the date\ncurrent_date = datetime(1909, 9, 9)\n\n# Subtract one day\nprevious_date = current_date - timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = previous_date.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the date one day before September 9, 1909.",
    "The code output confirms that the date one day before September 9, 1909, is September 8, 1909. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) 09/08/1909.\n\n<<<E>>>"
