    "To solve this problem, we need to convert the given UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY) to the US date format (MM/DD/YYYY) and then determine the date for the next day.\n\n1. The given date in UK format is 02/01/1987, which translates to January 2, 1987, in the US format (MM/DD/YYYY).\n\n2. We need to find the date for the next day, which would be January 3, 1987.\n\n3. We will then check which option matches this date.\n\nLet's write a Python script to confirm this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given date in UK format\nuk_date_str = \"02/01/1987\"\n\n# Convert to datetime object\nuk_date = datetime.strptime(uk_date_str, \"%d/%m/%Y\")\n\n# Calculate the next day\nnext_day = uk_date + timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Convert to US format\nus_date_str = next_day.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\nprint(us_date_str)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the next day in the US date format. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output confirms that the date tomorrow in the US format (MM/DD/YYYY) is 01/03/1987. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 12/06/1986  \n(B) 01/03/1987  \n(C) 01/04/1987  \n(D) 01/09/1987  \n(E) 01/03/2035  \n(F) 02/03/1986  \n\nThe correct option is (B) 01/03/1987.\n\n<<<B>>>"
