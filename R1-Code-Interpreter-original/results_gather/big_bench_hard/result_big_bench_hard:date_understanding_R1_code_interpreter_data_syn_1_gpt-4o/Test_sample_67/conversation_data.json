    "To solve this problem, we need to determine today's date and then calculate the date one week ago. The problem states that it was September 1st, 2021, a week ago. This means that today is September 8th, 2021.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the date one week ago from today. Since today is September 8th, 2021, one week ago would be September 1st, 2021.\n\nLet's verify this by using Python to calculate the date one week ago from September 8th, 2021.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Today's date is September 8th, 2021\ntoday_date = datetime(2021, 9, 8)\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = today_date - timedelta(weeks=1)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the date one week ago from September 8th, 2021.",
    "The code output confirms that the date one week ago from September 8th, 2021, is indeed September 1st, 2021. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<(C) 09/01/2021>>>"
