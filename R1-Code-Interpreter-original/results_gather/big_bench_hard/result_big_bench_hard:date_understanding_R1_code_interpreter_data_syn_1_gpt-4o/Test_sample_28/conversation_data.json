    "To solve this problem, we need to determine today's date based on the information that yesterday was April 30, 2021. Then, we will calculate the date one week ago from today.\n\n1. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - If yesterday was April 30, 2021, then today is May 1, 2021.\n\n2. **Calculate the Date One Week Ago:**\n   - One week ago from May 1, 2021, would be 7 days before May 1, 2021.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define today's date based on the information given\ntoday_date = datetime(2021, 5, 1)\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = today_date - timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the date one week ago from today.",
    "Based on the code execution, the date one week ago from today (May 1, 2021) is April 24, 2021. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 05/15/2021  \n(B) 04/23/2021  \n(C) 04/15/2021  \n(D) 06/05/2021  \n(E) 04/19/2021  \n(F) 04/24/2021  \n\nThe correct option is (F) 04/24/2021.\n\n<<<F>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Yesterday was April 30, 2021.
