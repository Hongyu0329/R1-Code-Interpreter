    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 24 hours after 6/19/2019. Since John is correct, we start from 6/19/2019 and add one day to it.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Start with the date 6/19/2019.\n2. Add 24 hours (which is equivalent to adding one day) to this date.\n3. Determine the resulting date.\n\nWe can use Python's `datetime` module to perform this date arithmetic efficiently. Here's the code to calculate the date 24 hours after 6/19/2019:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime.strptime(\"06/19/2019\", \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n# Add 24 hours (1 day)\nnew_date = start_date + timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Format the new date in MM/DD/YYYY\nresult = new_date.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct date.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the date 06/20/2019, which is 24 hours after 06/19/2019. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<06/20/2019>>>"
