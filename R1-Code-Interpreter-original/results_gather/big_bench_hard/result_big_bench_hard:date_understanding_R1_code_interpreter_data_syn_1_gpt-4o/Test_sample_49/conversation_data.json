    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary and then find the date of the day before that.\n\nA golden wedding anniversary marks 50 years of marriage. Since Jane and John married on January 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary would be 50 years later, on January 2, 2008.\n\nNow, we need to find the date of the day before January 2, 2008. This would be January 1, 2008.\n\nLet's verify this by calculating the date 50 years after January 2, 1958, and then subtracting one day to find the date yesterday.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Jane and John's wedding date\nwedding_date = datetime(1958, 1, 2)\n\n# Calculate the golden anniversary date\ngolden_anniversary = wedding_date.replace(year=wedding_date.year + 50)\n\n# Calculate the date yesterday\ndate_yesterday = golden_anniversary - timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date_yesterday = date_yesterday.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date_yesterday)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the date of the day before their golden wedding anniversary. Let's see the result.",
    "The code output confirms that the date yesterday, one day before Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary on January 2, 2008, is January 1, 2008.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<(B) 01/01/2008>>>"
