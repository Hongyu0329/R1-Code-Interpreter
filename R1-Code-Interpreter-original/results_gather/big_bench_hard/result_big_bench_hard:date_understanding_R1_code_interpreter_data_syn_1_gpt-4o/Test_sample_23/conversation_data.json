    "To solve this problem, we need to determine today's date based on the information given and then calculate the date one week ago.\n\n1. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - We know that 2015 is coming in 36 hours. This means that today is December 30, 2014, because 36 hours from now will be January 1, 2015.\n\n2. **Calculate the Date One Week Ago:**\n   - One week ago from December 30, 2014, would be December 23, 2014.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Today's date based on the information given\ntoday = datetime(2014, 12, 30)\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = today - timedelta(weeks=1)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the date one week ago.",
    "The code execution confirms that the date one week ago from December 30, 2014, is December 23, 2014. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<(B) 12/23/2014>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    2015 is coming in 36 hours.
