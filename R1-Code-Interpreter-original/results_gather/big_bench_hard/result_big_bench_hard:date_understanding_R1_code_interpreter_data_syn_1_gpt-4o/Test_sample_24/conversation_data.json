    "To solve this problem, we need to convert the given UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY) to the US date format (MM/DD/YYYY) and then determine the date for the previous day.\n\n1. The given date in UK format is 02/01/1987, which translates to January 2, 1987, in the US format (01/02/1987).\n\n2. We need to find the date for the previous day, which would be January 1, 1987, in the US format (01/01/1987).\n\n3. We will check the options to find the correct answer.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given date in UK format\nuk_date_str = \"02/01/1987\"\n\n# Convert to datetime object\nuk_date = datetime.strptime(uk_date_str, \"%d/%m/%Y\")\n\n# Find the previous day\nprevious_day = uk_date - timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Convert to US format\nus_date_str = previous_day.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n# Print the result\nprint(us_date_str)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will compare the result with the given options to find the correct answer.",
    "The code output confirms that the date yesterday in the US format (MM/DD/YYYY) is 01/01/1987. \n\nComparing this with the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A) 01/01/1987>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    In the UK, people usually put the day before the month when formatting the date.
