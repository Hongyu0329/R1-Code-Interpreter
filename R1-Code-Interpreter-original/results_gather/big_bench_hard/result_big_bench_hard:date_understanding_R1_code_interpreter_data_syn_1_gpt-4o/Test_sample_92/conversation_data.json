    "To find the date one week ago from September 9, 1909, we need to subtract 7 days from this date. This will give us the date exactly one week prior.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Start with the date September 9, 1909.\n2. Subtract 7 days from this date.\n3. Ensure the resulting date is in the format MM/DD/YYYY.\n\nWe can use Python's `datetime` module to perform this date calculation efficiently. Here's the plan:\n\n- Use `datetime` to represent the current date.\n- Subtract 7 days using `timedelta`.\n- Format the resulting date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nLet's write the code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Current date\ncurrent_date = datetime(1909, 9, 9)\n\n# Subtract 7 days\none_week_ago = current_date - timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the date one week ago from September 9, 1909.",
    "The code output indicates that the date one week ago from September 9, 1909, is September 2, 1909. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 09/02/1832  \n(B) 05/02/1909  \n(C) 09/02/1864  \n(D) 09/02/1906  \n(E) 09/02/1909  \n(F) 08/19/1909  \n\nThe correct option that matches the calculated date is (E) 09/02/1909.\n\n<<<E>>>"
