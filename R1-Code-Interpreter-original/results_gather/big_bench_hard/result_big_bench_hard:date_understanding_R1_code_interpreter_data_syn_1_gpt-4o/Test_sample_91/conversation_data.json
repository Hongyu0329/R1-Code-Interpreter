    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one year ago from today, which is April 10, 1985. We will subtract one year from this date to find the correct answer.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify today's date**: April 10, 1985.\n2. **Subtract one year**: This means we need to go back to April 10, 1984.\n\nNow, let's check the options provided to see which one matches April 10, 1984:\n\n- (A) 03/10/1986: This is March 10, 1986, which is not correct.\n- (B) 04/07/1985: This is April 7, 1985, which is not correct.\n- (C) 05/13/1985: This is May 13, 1985, which is not correct.\n- (D) 04/10/1984: This is April 10, 1984, which matches our calculation.\n- (E) 04/12/1986: This is April 12, 1986, which is not correct.\n- (F) 04/10/1985: This is April 10, 1985, which is not correct.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D) 04/10/1984.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today is Apr 10, 1985.
