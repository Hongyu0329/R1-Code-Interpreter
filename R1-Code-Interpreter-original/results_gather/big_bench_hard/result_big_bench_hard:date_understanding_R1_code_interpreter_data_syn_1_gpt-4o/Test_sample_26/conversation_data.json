    "To solve this problem, we need to determine today's date and then calculate the date one week ago. The deadline is given as June 1, 2021, which is 2 days away from today. Therefore, today's date is May 30, 2021. \n\nNow, we need to find the date one week ago from May 30, 2021. One week ago means subtracting 7 days from May 30, 2021.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Today's date based on the given deadline\ntoday = datetime(2021, 5, 30)\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = today - timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the date one week ago from May 30, 2021, in the required format.",
    "The code output indicates that the date one week ago from May 30, 2021, is May 23, 2021. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 05/23/2020  \n(B) 04/13/2021  \n(C) 05/24/2021  \n(D) 05/23/2054  \n(E) 05/23/1940  \n(F) 05/23/2021  \n\nThe correct option that matches the calculated date is (F) 05/23/2021.\n\n<<<F>>>"
