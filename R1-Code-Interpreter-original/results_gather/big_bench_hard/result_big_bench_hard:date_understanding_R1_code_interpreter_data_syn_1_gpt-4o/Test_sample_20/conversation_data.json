    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week ago from today. The problem states that yesterday was January 21, 2011. Therefore, today is January 22, 2011.\n\nTo find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from January 22, 2011. Let's calculate this using Python's `datetime` module to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define today's date\ntoday_date = datetime(2011, 1, 22)\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = today_date - timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the date one week ago from January 22, 2011.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the date one week ago from January 22, 2011, is January 15, 2011. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 12/06/2010  \n(B) 01/15/2011  \n(C) 01/17/2011  \n(D) 03/15/2011  \n(E) 12/24/2010  \n\nThe correct option that matches the calculated date is (B) 01/15/2011.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
