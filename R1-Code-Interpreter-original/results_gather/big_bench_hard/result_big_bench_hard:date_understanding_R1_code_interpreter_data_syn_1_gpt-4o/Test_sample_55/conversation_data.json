    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of the first Monday of 2019 and then find the date of the day before that.\n\n1. **Identify the first day of 2019**: We know that January 1, 2019, is a Tuesday.\n\n2. **Find the first Monday of 2019**: Since January 1, 2019, is a Tuesday, the first Monday of 2019 would be the following week. We can calculate this by adding 6 days to January 1, 2019.\n\n3. **Calculate the date of the first Monday**: \n   - January 1, 2019 (Tuesday) + 6 days = January 7, 2019 (Monday).\n\n4. **Find the date of the day before the first Monday**: \n   - The day before January 7, 2019, is January 6, 2019.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Start from January 1, 2019\nstart_date = datetime(2019, 1, 1)\n\n# Find the first Monday of 2019\n# January 1, 2019 is a Tuesday, so the first Monday is 6 days later\nfirst_monday = start_date + timedelta(days=6)\n\n# Find the date of the day before the first Monday\nday_before_monday = first_monday - timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = day_before_monday.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the date.",
    "The code execution confirms that the date of the day before the first Monday of 2019 is January 6, 2019. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<01/06/2019>>>"
