    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week from today, given that today is Jane and John's 5-year anniversary. \n\n1. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - Jane and John married on January 2, 1958.\n   - Their 5-year anniversary would be January 2, 1963.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week from Today:**\n   - We need to add 7 days to January 2, 1963.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Today's date is their 5-year anniversary\ntoday_date = datetime(1963, 1, 2)\n\n# Calculate the date one week from today\none_week_later = today_date + timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_later.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the date one week from January 2, 1963.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the date one week from January 2, 1963, which is January 9, 1963. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 01/16/1961  \n(B) 01/09/1961  \n(C) 01/09/1963  \n(D) 03/09/1960  \n(E) 07/09/1960  \n(F) 02/28/1961  \n\nThe correct option is (C) 01/09/1963.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958.
