    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current date based on the information given and then find out what the date will be tomorrow.\n\n1. Jane got her job in 2016, and today is her 3-year work anniversary. This means she started her job in 2016 + 3 = 2019.\n2. Since today is her work anniversary, today is the same date she started her job in 2016.\n3. We know that on December 2, it was her second day at work. Therefore, she started her job on December 1, 2016.\n4. Since today is her 3-year work anniversary, today is December 1, 2019.\n5. Therefore, tomorrow will be December 2, 2019.\n\nNow, let's check the options to find the correct date for tomorrow:\n\n- (A) 08/02/2020\n- (B) 12/02/1950\n- (C) 11/18/2019\n- (D) 12/02/2019\n- (E) 01/02/2020\n- (F) 12/01/2019\n\nThe correct option for tomorrow's date is (D) 12/02/2019.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jane got her job in 2016.
