    "To determine the date one week from April 19, 1969, we need to add 7 days to the given date. This involves simple date arithmetic. Let's calculate this using Python's `datetime` module to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given date\nstart_date = datetime(1969, 4, 19)\n\n# Add 7 days\nnew_date = start_date + timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the new date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = new_date.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the date one week from April 19, 1969.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the date one week from April 19, 1969, is April 26, 1969. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) 04/26/1969.\n\n<<<A>>>"
