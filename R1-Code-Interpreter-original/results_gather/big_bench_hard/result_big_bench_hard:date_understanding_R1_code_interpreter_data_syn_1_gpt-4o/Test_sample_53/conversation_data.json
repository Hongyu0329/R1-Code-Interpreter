    "To solve this problem, we need to determine today's date and then calculate the date one year ago from today.\n\n1. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - Yesterday was April 30, 2021. Therefore, today is May 1, 2021.\n\n2. **Calculate One Year Ago:**\n   - One year ago from May 1, 2021, would be May 1, 2020.\n\n3. **Match with Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches the date May 1, 2020.\n\nLet's check the options:\n- (A) 05/15/2020\n- (B) 05/01/2020\n- (C) 05/08/2020\n- (D) 04/01/2020\n- (E) 05/01/1971\n\nThe correct option that matches May 1, 2020, is (B) 05/01/2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<05/01/2020>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Yesterday was April 30, 2021.
