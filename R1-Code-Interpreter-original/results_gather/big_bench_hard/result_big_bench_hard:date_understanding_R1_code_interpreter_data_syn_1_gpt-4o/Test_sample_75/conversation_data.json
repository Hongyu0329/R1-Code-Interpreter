    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week from the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The first quarter of a year consists of January, February, and March. Therefore, the last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the date one week (7 days) from March 31, 2008. We can do this by adding 7 days to March 31, 2008.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this date calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the last day of the first quarter of 2008\nlast_day_of_first_quarter = datetime(2008, 3, 31)\n\n# Calculate the date one week from the last day of the first quarter\none_week_later = last_day_of_first_quarter + timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY format\nformatted_date = one_week_later.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n# Print the result\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the date one week from March 31, 2008.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the date one week from March 31, 2008, as April 7, 2008. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
