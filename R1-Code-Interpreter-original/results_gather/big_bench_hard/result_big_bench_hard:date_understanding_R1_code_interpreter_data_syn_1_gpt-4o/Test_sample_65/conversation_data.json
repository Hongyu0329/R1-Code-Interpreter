    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week (7 days) before April 19, 1969. We can do this by subtracting 7 days from the given date. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the date 04/19/1969.\n2. Subtract 7 days from this date.\n3. Check which of the given options matches the calculated date.\n\nWe can use Python's `datetime` module to perform this date calculation efficiently.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given date\ncurrent_date = datetime(1969, 4, 19)\n\n# Subtract 7 days\none_week_ago = current_date - timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the date one week ago from April 19, 1969.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the date one week ago from April 19, 1969, is April 12, 1969. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 03/28/1969  \n(B) 04/12/1969  \n(C) 04/02/1969  \n(D) 03/04/1969  \n(E) 02/12/1970  \n(F) 04/13/1969  \n\nThe correct option is (B) 04/12/1969.\n\n<<<B>>>"
