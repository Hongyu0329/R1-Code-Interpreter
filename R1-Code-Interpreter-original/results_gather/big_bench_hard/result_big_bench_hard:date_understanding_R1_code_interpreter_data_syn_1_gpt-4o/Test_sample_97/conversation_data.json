    "To determine the date today given that tomorrow is 11/12/2019, we need to subtract one day from the given date. The date format is MM/DD/YYYY, so we need to find the date one day before 11/12/2019.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. The given date is 11/12/2019, which means November 12, 2019.\n2. Subtracting one day from November 12, 2019, will give us November 11, 2019.\n\nNow, let's check the options provided:\n\n- (A) 11/12/2019: This is the date for tomorrow, not today.\n- (B) 11/11/2042: This is a future date, not relevant.\n- (C) 11/11/2020: This is a future date, not relevant.\n- (D) 11/01/2019: This is earlier in November, not one day before 11/12/2019.\n- (E) 11/11/2019: This is one day before 11/12/2019.\n- (F) 11/25/2019: This is later in November, not one day before 11/12/2019.\n\nThe correct option is (E) 11/11/2019.\n\nTherefore, the date today is 11/11/2019.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tomorrow is 11/12/2019.
