    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Jane's 16th birthday and then find the date of the following day.\n\n1. **Determine Jane's Birth Date:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000. Since 2000 is a leap year, the last day of February is February 29, 2000.\n\n2. **Calculate Jane's 16th Birthday:**\n   - If Jane was born on February 29, 2000, her 16th birthday would be on February 29, 2016, because 2016 is also a leap year.\n\n3. **Find the Date of the Following Day:**\n   - The day after February 29, 2016, is March 1, 2016.\n\nNow, let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Jane's birth date\nbirth_date = datetime(2000, 2, 29)\n\n# Calculate her 16th birthday\nsixteenth_birthday = birth_date.replace(year=birth_date.year + 16)\n\n# Calculate the next day\nnext_day = sixteenth_birthday + timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Format the date as MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = next_day.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the date.",
    "The code execution confirms that the date after Jane's 16th birthday, which is February 29, 2016, is March 1, 2016. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<03/01/2016>>>"
