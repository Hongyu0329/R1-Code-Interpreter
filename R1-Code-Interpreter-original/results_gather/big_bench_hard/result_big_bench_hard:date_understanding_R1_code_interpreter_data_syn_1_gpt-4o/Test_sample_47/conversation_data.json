    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 10 days before Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary marks 50 years of marriage. \n\n1. **Calculate the Golden Wedding Anniversary Date:**\n   - Jane and John married on January 2, 1958.\n   - Their golden wedding anniversary would be 50 years later, which is January 2, 2008.\n\n2. **Calculate the Date 10 Days Before the Anniversary:**\n   - We need to find the date 10 days before January 2, 2008.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the date 10 days before January 2, 2008.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Anniversary date\nanniversary_date = datetime(2008, 1, 2)\n\n# Calculate the date 10 days before\ndate_10_days_before = anniversary_date - timedelta(days=10)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = date_10_days_before.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the date 10 days before the anniversary.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the date 10 days before January 2, 2008, as December 23, 2007. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 03/29/2008  \n(B) 12/17/2007  \n(C) 08/23/2007  \n(D) 12/22/2007  \n(E) 12/23/2007  \n\nThe correct option is (E) 12/23/2007.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958.
