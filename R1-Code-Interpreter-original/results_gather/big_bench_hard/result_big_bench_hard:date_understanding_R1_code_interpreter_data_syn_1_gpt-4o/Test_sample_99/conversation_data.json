    "To solve this problem, we need to determine today's date and then calculate the date one week from today.\n\n1. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - Yesterday was April 30, 2021. Therefore, today is May 1, 2021.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week from Today:**\n   - One week from today (May 1, 2021) would be May 8, 2021.\n\n3. **Match with the Given Options:**\n   - We need to check which option corresponds to May 8, 2021.\n\nLet's write a Python script to confirm the date one week from today.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given that yesterday was April 30, 2021\nyesterday = datetime(2021, 4, 30)\n\n# Today is one day after yesterday\ntoday = yesterday + timedelta(days=1)\n\n# One week from today\none_week_from_today = today + timedelta(weeks=1)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_from_today.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will compare the result with the options provided.",
    "The code output indicates that one week from today, May 1, 2021, is May 8, 2021. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n- (A) 05/10/2021\n- (B) 03/13/2021\n- (C) 04/10/2021\n- (D) 04/27/2021\n- (E) 05/09/2021\n- (F) 05/08/2021\n\nThe correct option that matches the date one week from today is (F) 05/08/2021.\n\n<<<F>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Yesterday was April 30, 2021.
