    "\nassistant > To find a movie similar to \"Batman,\" \"The Mask,\" \"The Fugitive,\" and \"Pretty Woman,\" we need to consider the genres and themes of these films:\n\n1. **Batman** - This is a superhero film with action and crime elements.\n2. **The Mask** - This is a comedy with elements of action and fantasy.\n3. **The Fugitive** - This is a thriller with action and crime elements.\n4. **Pretty Woman** - This is a romantic comedy.\n\nThe common elements among these films are action, crime, and comedy. Let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **The Front Page** - This is a comedy film, but it is more of a classic comedy-drama about journalism and doesn't have the action or crime elements.\n\n(B) **Maelstrom** - This is a drama film with elements of mystery and fantasy, but it doesn't align well with the action or comedy aspects.\n\n(C) **The Lion King** - This is an animated musical film with adventure and drama, but it doesn't fit the action, crime, or comedy elements.\n\n(D) **Lamerica** - This is a drama film with political and social themes, lacking the action, crime, or comedy elements.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the options perfectly match all the elements, but the closest match in terms of comedy and some action elements would be **The Front Page**. However, it lacks the crime aspect.\n\nGiven the options, the best choice considering the comedy aspect is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
