    "\nassistant > To find a movie similar to \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Independence Day,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" and \"Jurassic Park,\" we need to consider the genres and themes of these films:\n\n1. **Beauty and the Beast** - A romantic fantasy film with elements of musical and fairy tale.\n2. **Independence Day** - A science fiction action film with themes of alien invasion and human resilience.\n3. **Forrest Gump** - A drama with elements of romance and historical events, focusing on the life journey of an individual.\n4. **Jurassic Park** - A science fiction adventure film with themes of dinosaurs and the consequences of scientific experimentation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **The Bag Man** - A crime thriller film.\n(B) **The Silence of the Lambs** - A psychological horror thriller.\n(C) **Extreme Measures** - A medical thriller with elements of mystery.\n(D) **Kicking Off** - A comedy film about football (soccer) fans.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the genres of the given movies, but we can look for a film that might share some thematic elements or appeal to a similar audience. \"The Silence of the Lambs\" is a well-known film that, like \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Independence Day,\" has a strong suspense element and was a major box office success. However, it is more of a thriller/horror film.\n\nConsidering the mix of genres and the broad appeal of the original movies, the closest match in terms of being a major film with suspense and drama elements might be:\n\n<<<The Silence of the Lambs>>>"
