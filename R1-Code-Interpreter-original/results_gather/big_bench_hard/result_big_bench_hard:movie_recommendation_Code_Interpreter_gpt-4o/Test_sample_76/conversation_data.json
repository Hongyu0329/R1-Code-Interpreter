    "\nassistant > To find a movie similar to \"Braveheart,\" \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Schindler's List,\" and \"Apollo 13,\" we should consider the themes, genres, and styles of these films:\n\n1. **Braveheart** - A historical epic war film.\n2. **Pretty Woman** - A romantic comedy.\n3. **Schindler's List** - A historical drama about the Holocaust.\n4. **Apollo 13** - A historical drama about a space mission.\n\nThe common thread among these films is that they are all dramas with significant historical or cultural themes, except for \"Pretty Woman,\" which is a romantic comedy. However, \"Pretty Woman\" is a classic film with a strong narrative, much like the others.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) **Bad Taste** - A low-budget science fiction comedy horror film, not similar in theme or style.\n\n(B) **My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2** - A romantic comedy, similar in genre to \"Pretty Woman\" but not in historical or dramatic themes.\n\n(C) **The Santa Clause 2** - A family comedy film, not similar in theme or style.\n\n(D) **Dances with Wolves** - A historical drama film, similar in style and theme to \"Braveheart\" and \"Schindler's List.\"\n\nGiven these considerations, the movie most similar to the ones listed is \"Dances with Wolves,\" as it shares the historical drama aspect with \"Braveheart\" and \"Schindler's List.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
