    "To determine when Thomas could have gone to the clothing store, we need to analyze the given information and eliminate the times when Thomas was confirmed to be elsewhere.\n\n1. **Thomas's Schedule:**\n   - Thomas woke up at 6am.\n   - James saw Thomas walking in the garden from 6am to 9am.\n   - Andrew saw Thomas buying lunch at the deli from 12pm to 7pm.\n   - Sarah saw Thomas watching a movie at the theater from 7pm to 8pm.\n   - The clothing store was closed after 8pm.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - **Option (A) 7pm to 8pm:** During this time, Sarah saw Thomas watching a movie at the theater. Therefore, Thomas could not have gone to the clothing store during this time.\n   - **Option (B) 9am to 12pm:** There is no information about Thomas's whereabouts during this time. Therefore, it is possible that Thomas could have gone to the clothing store during this time.\n   - **Option (C) 6am to 9am:** During this time, James saw Thomas walking in the garden. Therefore, Thomas could not have gone to the clothing store during this time.\n   - **Option (D) 12pm to 7pm:** During this time, Andrew saw Thomas buying lunch at the deli. Therefore, Thomas could not have gone to the clothing store during this time.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time period when Thomas's whereabouts are not accounted for is from 9am to 12pm. Therefore, this is the time when Thomas could have gone to the clothing store.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B>>>."
