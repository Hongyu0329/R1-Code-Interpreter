    "To determine when Jessica could have gone to the basketball court, we need to analyze her schedule and the given options:\n\n1. **5am to 6am**: \n   - Jessica was seen by Michael buying clothes at the mall during this time. \n   - Therefore, she could not have been at the basketball court.\n\n2. **6am to 7am**: \n   - Jessica was seen by Steven buying a bike at the bike shop during this time.\n   - Therefore, she could not have been at the basketball court.\n\n3. **7am to 2pm**: \n   - Jessica was seen by Sean waiting at the train station during this time.\n   - Therefore, she could not have been at the basketball court.\n\n4. **2pm to 6pm**: \n   - Jessica was seen by Elizabeth taking photos near the Eiffel Tower during this time.\n   - Therefore, she could not have been at the basketball court.\n\n5. **6pm to 9pm**: \n   - Jessica was seen by Sarah walking towards the Statue of Liberty during this time.\n   - Therefore, she could not have been at the basketball court.\n\n6. **9pm to 10pm**: \n   - There is no information about Jessica's activities during this time.\n   - The basketball court was closed after 10pm, so she could have gone to the basketball court between 9pm and 10pm.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Jessica could have gone to the basketball court is between 9pm and 10pm.\n\nThe correct answer is: <<<C) 9pm to 10pm>>>."
