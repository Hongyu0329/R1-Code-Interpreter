    "To determine when James could have gone to the swimming pool, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **James woke up at 10am.**\n   - This is the starting point of the day for James.\n\n2. **Richard saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 10am to 11am.**\n   - James was occupied from 10am to 11am.\n\n3. **Leslie saw James waiting at the airport from 12pm to 2pm.**\n   - James was occupied from 12pm to 2pm.\n\n4. **Ashley saw James sitting on a rooftop from 2pm to 5pm.**\n   - James was occupied from 2pm to 5pm.\n\n5. **Thomas saw James playing tennis at the tennis court from 5pm to 6pm.**\n   - James was occupied from 5pm to 6pm.\n\n6. **Jennifer saw James walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 7pm.**\n   - James was occupied from 6pm to 7pm.\n\n7. **The swimming pool was closed after 7pm.**\n   - James could not have gone to the swimming pool after 7pm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the available time slots:\n\n- **10am to 11am:** James was taking photos, so he couldn't have gone to the pool.\n- **11am to 12pm:** This is a potential free time slot for James.\n- **12pm to 2pm:** James was at the airport, so he couldn't have gone to the pool.\n- **2pm to 5pm:** James was on a rooftop, so he couldn't have gone to the pool.\n- **5pm to 6pm:** James was playing tennis, so he couldn't have gone to the pool.\n- **6pm to 7pm:** James was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so he couldn't have gone to the pool.\n- **After 7pm:** The pool was closed, so James couldn't have gone to the pool.\n\nThe only time slot when James was not seen by anyone and the pool was open is from 11am to 12pm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C) 11am to 12pm>>>"
