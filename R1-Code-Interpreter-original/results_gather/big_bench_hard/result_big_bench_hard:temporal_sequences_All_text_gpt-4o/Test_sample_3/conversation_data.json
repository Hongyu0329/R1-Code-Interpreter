    "To determine when James could have gone to the beach, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **James woke up at 5am.**\n   - This is the start of the timeline for James's activities.\n\n2. **Sean saw James walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 5am to 6am.**\n   - James was occupied during this time.\n\n3. **Michael saw James driving to the water park from 6am to 7am.**\n   - James was occupied during this time.\n\n4. **Anthony saw James reading at the library from 7am to 3pm.**\n   - James was occupied during this time.\n\n5. **William saw James getting a coffee at the cafe from 4pm to 9pm.**\n   - James was occupied during this time.\n\n6. **The beach was closed after 9pm.**\n   - James cannot go to the beach after 9pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 7am to 3pm:**\n  - James was seen reading at the library during this entire period, so he could not have gone to the beach.\n\n- **Option (B) 5am to 6am:**\n  - James was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty during this time, so he could not have gone to the beach.\n\n- **Option (C) 4pm to 9pm:**\n  - James was seen getting a coffee at the cafe during this entire period, so he could not have gone to the beach.\n\n- **Option (D) 3pm to 4pm:**\n  - There is no record of James's activities during this time, making it the only possible window for him to have gone to the beach.\n\nTherefore, the only time James could have gone to the beach is between 3pm and 4pm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
