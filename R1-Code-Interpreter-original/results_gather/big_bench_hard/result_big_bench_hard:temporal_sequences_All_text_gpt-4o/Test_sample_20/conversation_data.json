    "To determine when Tiffany could have gone to the market, we need to analyze her schedule and the given options:\n\n1. **6am to 9am**: \n   - Tiffany was seen by Sarah reading at the library during this time. \n   - Therefore, Tiffany could not have gone to the market during this time.\n   - **Option (A) is not possible.**\n\n2. **9am to 10am**: \n   - Betty saw Tiffany driving to the water park during this time.\n   - Therefore, Tiffany could not have gone to the market during this time.\n   - This time is not listed as an option, but it confirms Tiffany was busy.\n\n3. **10am to 12pm**: \n   - There is no information about Tiffany's activities during this time.\n   - This is a potential time slot when Tiffany could have gone to the market.\n   - **Option (B) is possible.**\n\n4. **12pm to 6pm**: \n   - Linda saw Tiffany buying a phone at the electronics store during this time.\n   - Therefore, Tiffany could not have gone to the market during this time.\n   - **Option (D) is not possible.**\n\n5. **6pm to 10pm**: \n   - Mary saw Tiffany working out at the gym during this time.\n   - Therefore, Tiffany could not have gone to the market during this time.\n   - **Option (C) is not possible.**\n\n6. **After 10pm**: \n   - The market was closed after 10pm, so Tiffany could not have gone to the market after this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Tiffany could have gone to the market is between 10am and 12pm.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B>>>."
