    "To determine the time frame during which Emily could have gone to the soccer field, we need to analyze the timeline of events provided:\n\n1. **10am to 12pm**: Emily was seen by Linda at the train station. This means Emily was at the train station during this entire time period and could not have been at the soccer field.\n\n2. **12pm to 1pm**: Emily was seen by Ashley fixing their computer at the electronic store. This indicates that Emily was occupied at the electronic store during this time and could not have been at the soccer field.\n\n3. **1pm to 2pm**: John saw Emily walking towards the Statue of Liberty. This suggests that Emily was on her way to the Statue of Liberty and not at the soccer field during this time.\n\n4. **After 8pm**: The soccer field was closed. Therefore, Emily could not have gone to the soccer field after 8pm.\n\nGiven these observations, the only time period not accounted for by the events described is from **2pm to 8pm**. During this time, there is no information about Emily's whereabouts, and the soccer field was open. Therefore, this is the only possible time frame during which Emily could have gone to the soccer field.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) 2pm to 8pm>>>"
