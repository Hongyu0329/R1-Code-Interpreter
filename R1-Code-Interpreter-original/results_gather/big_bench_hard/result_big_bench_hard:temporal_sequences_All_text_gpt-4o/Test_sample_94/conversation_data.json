    "To determine the time frame during which Tiffany could have gone to the construction site, we need to analyze the information provided about her activities throughout the day:\n\n1. **7am to 9am**: Tiffany was attending class at the school. Therefore, she could not have gone to the construction site during this time.\n\n2. **9am to 1pm**: Tiffany was seen waiting at the airport. Thus, she could not have visited the construction site during this period either.\n\n3. **1pm to 4pm**: There is no information provided about Tiffany's activities during this time. This is a potential time frame when she could have gone to the construction site.\n\n4. **4pm to 7pm**: Tiffany was seen buying lunch at the deli. Therefore, she could not have been at the construction site during this time.\n\n5. **After 7pm**: The construction site was closed after 7pm, so she could not have gone there after this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame during which Tiffany could have gone to the construction site is between 1pm and 4pm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D) 1pm to 4pm>>>"
