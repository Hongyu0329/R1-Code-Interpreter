This is a possible time for him to have gone to the art show.\n   - **Option (D) 1pm to 6pm:** William was working at the office during this time, so he could not have gone to the art show.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time slot where William is not accounted for and could have gone to the art show is between 5am and 8am.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
