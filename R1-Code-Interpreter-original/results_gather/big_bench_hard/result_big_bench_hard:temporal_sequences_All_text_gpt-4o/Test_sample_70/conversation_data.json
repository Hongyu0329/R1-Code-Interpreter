Susan woke up at 5am.\n2. Anthony saw Susan at the train station from 5am to 8am. This means Susan was at the train station during this time.\n3. James saw Susan at the theater from 11am to 5pm. This means Susan was at the theater during this time.\n4. Mary saw Susan on a rooftop from 5pm to 9pm. This means Susan was on the rooftop during this time.\n5. The amusement park was closed after 9pm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- Option (A) 8am to 11am: This time frame is not covered by any of the sightings, so it is possible that Susan could have gone to the amusement park during this time.\n- Option (B) 5am to 8am: Susan was seen at the train station during this time, so she could not have been at the amusement park.\n- Option (C) 5pm to 9pm: Susan was seen on a rooftop during this time, so she could not have been at the amusement park.\n- Option (D) 11am to 5pm: Susan was seen at the theater during this time, so she could not have been at the amusement park.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame during which Susan could have gone to the amusement park is from 8am to 11am.\n\n<<<A>>>"
