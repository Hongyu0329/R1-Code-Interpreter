    "To determine when Samantha could have gone to the swimming pool, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and the pool's availability:\n\n1. **Samantha's Schedule:**\n   - Samantha woke up at 6am.\n   - James saw Samantha buying lunch at the deli from 6am to 1pm. This implies she was occupied during this time.\n   - Emily saw Samantha playing tennis at the tennis court from 1pm to 2pm. This implies she was occupied during this time.\n   - Kimberly saw Samantha working out at the gym from 4pm to 5pm. This implies she was occupied during this time.\n\n2. **Swimming Pool Availability:**\n   - The swimming pool was closed after 5pm. Therefore, Samantha could only go to the pool before 5pm.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - **Option (A) 4pm to 5pm:** Samantha was at the gym during this time, so she could not have been at the pool.\n   - **Option (B) 2pm to 4pm:** There is no record of Samantha's activities during this time, so she could have gone to the pool.\n   - **Option (C) 6am to 1pm:** Samantha was seen buying lunch at the deli during this time, so she could not have been at the pool.\n   - **Option (D) 1pm to 2pm:** Samantha was playing tennis during this time, so she could not have been at the pool.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Samantha could have gone to the swimming pool is between 2pm and 4pm.\n\n<<<B>>>"
