    "To determine the time frame during which Susan could have gone to the art studio, we need to analyze her schedule based on the information provided:\n\n1. Susan woke up at 5am.\n2. Kimberly saw Susan at the train station from 5am to 6am.\n3. Lisa saw Susan at the gym from 6am to 11am.\n4. Betty saw Susan at the library from 11am to 12pm.\n5. The art studio was closed after 1pm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 12pm to 1pm**: This is a possible time frame because Susan was seen at the library until 12pm, and the art studio was open until 1pm. Therefore, she could have gone to the art studio between 12pm and 1pm.\n\n- **Option (B) 11am to 12pm**: This is not possible because Susan was seen at the library during this time.\n\n- **Option (C) 6am to 11am**: This is not possible because Susan was seen at the gym during this time.\n\n- **Option (D) 5am to 6am**: This is not possible because Susan was seen at the train station during this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame during which Susan could have gone to the art studio is from 12pm to 1pm.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
