    "To determine the time frame during which Leslie could have gone to the beach, we need to analyze the information provided about Leslie's activities throughout the day:\n\n1. Leslie woke up at 7am.\n2. From 7am to 9am, Leslie was seen stretching at a yoga studio.\n3. From 9am to 11am, Leslie was seen playing tennis at the tennis court.\n4. From 11am to 4pm, Leslie was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty.\n5. The beach was closed after 8pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- Option (A) 9am to 11am: During this time, Leslie was playing tennis, so Leslie could not have gone to the beach.\n- Option (B) 4pm to 8pm: Leslie was last seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty until 4pm. After 4pm, there is no information about Leslie's activities, and the beach is open until 8pm. Therefore, Leslie could have gone to the beach during this time.\n- Option (C) 7am to 9am: During this time, Leslie was stretching at a yoga studio, so Leslie could not have gone to the beach.\n- Option (D) 11am to 4pm: During this time, Leslie was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so Leslie could not have gone to the beach.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame during which Leslie could have gone to the beach is from 4pm to 8pm.\n\n<<<B>>>"
