    "To determine when Andrew could have gone to the dance studio, we need to analyze the given information and eliminate the times when Andrew was confirmed to be elsewhere.\n\n1. **8am to 11am**: \n   - Thomas saw Andrew playing tennis at the tennis court from 8am to 11am.\n   - Therefore, Andrew could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n2. **11am to 1pm**:\n   - Mary saw Andrew reading at the library from 11am to 1pm.\n   - Therefore, Andrew could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n3. **8pm to 10pm**:\n   - Michael saw Andrew fixing their computer at the electronic store from 8pm to 10pm.\n   - Therefore, Andrew could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n4. **1pm to 8pm**:\n   - There is no information provided about Andrew's activities between 1pm and 8pm.\n   - Therefore, this is the only time period when Andrew could have gone to the dance studio.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the only time Andrew could have gone to the dance studio is between 1pm and 8pm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
