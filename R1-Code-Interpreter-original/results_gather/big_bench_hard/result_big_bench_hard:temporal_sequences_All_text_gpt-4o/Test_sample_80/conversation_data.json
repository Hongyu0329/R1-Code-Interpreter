    "To determine when William could have gone to the art studio, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **William's Wake-Up Time:**\n   - William woke up at 6am.\n\n2. **6am to 7am:**\n   - Anthony saw William getting a coffee at the cafe. This means William was occupied during this time.\n\n3. **8am to 10am:**\n   - John saw William watching a movie at the theater. William was occupied during this time.\n\n4. **10am to 12pm:**\n   - Hannah saw William waiting at the train station. William was occupied during this time.\n\n5. **12pm to 1pm:**\n   - Mark saw William walking towards the Statue of Liberty. William was occupied during this time.\n\n6. **1pm to 6pm:**\n   - William was working out at the gym. William was occupied during this time.\n\n7. **Art Studio Closing Time:**\n   - The art studio was closed after 6pm, so William could not have gone after this time.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 8am to 10am:** William was watching a movie at the theater, so he could not have gone to the art studio during this time.\n\n- **Option (B) 7am to 8am:** This time slot is not mentioned in the list of William's activities, so it is a potential time when he could have gone to the art studio.\n\n- **Option (C) 1pm to 6pm:** William was working out at the gym, so he could not have gone to the art studio during this time.\n\n- **Option (D) 12pm to 1pm:** William was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so he could not have gone to the art studio during this time.\n\nThe only time slot that is not accounted for by William's activities and when the art studio was open is 7am to 8am.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
