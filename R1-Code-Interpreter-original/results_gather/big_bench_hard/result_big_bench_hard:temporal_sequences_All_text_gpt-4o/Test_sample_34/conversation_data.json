    "To determine the time frame during which David could have gone to the gas station, we need to analyze the information provided about his activities throughout the day:\n\n1. **David woke up at 5am.**\n   - This means he could potentially start his day and go to the gas station any time after 5am.\n\n2. **Jennifer saw David taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7am to 9am.**\n   - During this time, David was occupied with taking photos, so he could not have gone to the gas station between 7am and 9am.\n\n3. **Kimberly saw David buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 3pm.**\n   - David was busy buying a bike during this period, so he could not have gone to the gas station between 9am and 3pm.\n\n4. **Linda saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 3pm to 9pm.**\n   - David was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station between 3pm and 9pm.\n\n5. **The gas station was closed after 9pm.**\n   - This means David could not have gone to the gas station after 9pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 5am to 7am:**\n  - David was awake and not reported to be engaged in any other activity during this time. Therefore, he could have gone to the gas station between 5am and 7am.\n\n- **Option (B) 7am to 9am:**\n  - David was taking photos during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station.\n\n- **Option (C) 3pm to 9pm:**\n  - David was walking towards the Statue of Liberty during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station.\n\n- **Option (D) 9am to 3pm:**\n  - David was buying a bike during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame during which David could have gone to the gas station is from 5am to 7am.\n\n<<<A>>>"
