    "To determine when Thomas could have gone to the football field, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and identify any gaps where he was not seen by anyone.\n\n1. **8am to 10am**: Thomas was seen by David fixing a computer at the electronic store. Therefore, he could not have gone to the football field during this time.\n\n2. **10am to 12pm**: Thomas was seen by Jennifer buying lunch at the deli. Therefore, he could not have gone to the football field during this time.\n\n3. **12pm to 2pm**: Thomas was seen by Lisa walking towards the Statue of Liberty. Therefore, he could not have gone to the football field during this time.\n\n4. **2pm to 5pm**: Thomas was seen by Sarah buying a phone at the electronics store. Therefore, he could not have gone to the football field during this time.\n\n5. **5pm to 6pm**: There is no information about Thomas's whereabouts during this time. This is a potential gap where he could have gone to the football field.\n\n6. **6pm to 9pm**: Thomas was seen by Kimberly buying a bike at the bike shop. Therefore, he could not have gone to the football field during this time.\n\n7. **After 9pm**: The football field was closed, so Thomas could not have gone there after 9pm.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Thomas could have gone to the football field is between 5pm and 6pm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
