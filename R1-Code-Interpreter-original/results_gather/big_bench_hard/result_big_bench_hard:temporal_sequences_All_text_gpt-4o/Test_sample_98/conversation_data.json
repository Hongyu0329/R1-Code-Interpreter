    "To determine the time frame during which Ashley could have gone to the basketball court, we need to analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Ashley woke up at 9am.**\n   - This means Ashley could not have done anything before 9am.\n\n2. **John saw Ashley taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 10am.**\n   - Ashley was occupied from 9am to 10am.\n\n3. **Linda saw Ashley walking in the garden from 10am to 1pm.**\n   - Ashley was occupied from 10am to 1pm.\n\n4. **Ashley saw Ashley attending class at the school from 1pm to 2pm.**\n   - Ashley was occupied from 1pm to 2pm.\n\n5. **The basketball court was closed after 7pm.**\n   - Ashley could not have gone to the basketball court after 7pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 2pm to 7pm:**\n  - Ashley is free after 2pm and the basketball court is open until 7pm. This is a possible time frame.\n\n- **Option (B) 9am to 10am:**\n  - Ashley was taking photos during this time, so this is not possible.\n\n- **Option (C) 1pm to 2pm:**\n  - Ashley was attending class during this time, so this is not possible.\n\n- **Option (D) 10am to 1pm:**\n  - Ashley was walking in the garden during this time, so this is not possible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Ashley could have gone to the basketball court is between 2pm and 7pm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
