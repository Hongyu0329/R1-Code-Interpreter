    "To determine when Jessica could have gone to the beach, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and identify any gaps where she was not seen by anyone else.\n\n1. **5am to 8am**: Jessica was seen by Emily at the yoga studio. Therefore, she could not have gone to the beach during this time.\n\n2. **8am to 9am**: Thomas saw Jessica taking photos near the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, she could not have gone to the beach during this time.\n\n3. **9am to 12pm**: There is no information about Jessica's whereabouts during this time. This is a potential time slot when she could have gone to the beach.\n\n4. **12pm to 3pm**: Richard saw Jessica fixing a computer at the electronic store. Therefore, she could not have gone to the beach during this time.\n\n5. **3pm to 7pm**: Kimberly saw Jessica watching a movie at the theater. Therefore, she could not have gone to the beach during this time.\n\n6. **7pm to 10pm**: Sarah saw Jessica driving to the water park. Therefore, she could not have gone to the beach during this time.\n\n7. **After 10pm**: The beach was closed, so she could not have gone to the beach after this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Jessica could have gone to the beach is between 9am and 12pm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<C) 9am to 12pm>>>."
