    "To determine the time frame during which Nancy could have gone to the bookstore, we need to analyze the information provided about her activities throughout the day:\n\n1. **8am to 9am**: Nancy was seen by Jennifer buying cookies at a bakery. Therefore, she could not have gone to the bookstore during this time.\n\n2. **9am to 12pm**: Nancy was seen by William taking photos near the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, she could not have gone to the bookstore during this time.\n\n3. **12pm to 2pm**: Nancy was seen by Mary playing tennis at the tennis court. Therefore, she could not have gone to the bookstore during this time.\n\n4. **After 2pm**: There is no information provided about Nancy's activities after 2pm. The bookstore was closed after 9pm, so Nancy could have gone to the bookstore anytime between 2pm and 9pm.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame during which Nancy could have gone to the bookstore is from 2pm to 9pm.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<C) 2pm to 9pm>>>"
