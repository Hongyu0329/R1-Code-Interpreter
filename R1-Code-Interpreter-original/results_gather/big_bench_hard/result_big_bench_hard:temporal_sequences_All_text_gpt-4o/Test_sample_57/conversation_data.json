    "To determine when Michael could have gone to the football field, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **Michael's Wake-Up Time:**\n   - Michael woke up at 10am. This means he could not have gone to the football field before 10am.\n\n2. **Michael's Activities:**\n   - From 12pm to 2pm, John saw Michael taking photos near the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, Michael could not have been at the football field during this time.\n   - From 2pm to 4pm, Samantha saw Michael watching a movie at the theater. Therefore, Michael could not have been at the football field during this time.\n   - From 4pm to 8pm, Thomas saw Michael sitting on a rooftop. Therefore, Michael could not have been at the football field during this time.\n\n3. **Football Field Closing Time:**\n   - The football field was closed after 8pm. Therefore, Michael could not have gone to the football field after 8pm.\n\n4. **Possible Time Slot:**\n   - The only time slot left for Michael to have gone to the football field is between 10am and 12pm, as this is the only period not accounted for by his other activities and it is after he woke up.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only viable option is:\n\n<<<B) 10am to 12pm>>>"
