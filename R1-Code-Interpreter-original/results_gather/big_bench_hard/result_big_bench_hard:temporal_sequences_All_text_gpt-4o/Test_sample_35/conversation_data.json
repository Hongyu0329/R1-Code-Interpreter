    "To determine the time frame during which David could have gone to the dance studio, we need to analyze the information provided about his activities throughout the day:\n\n1. **5am to 8am**: David was seen playing tennis at the tennis court by Betty. Therefore, he could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n2. **8am to 11am**: David was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty by Anthony. Therefore, he could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n3. **11am to 12pm**: There is no information about David's activities during this time. This is a potential time frame when he could have gone to the dance studio.\n\n4. **12pm to 5pm**: David was seen taking photos near the Eiffel Tower by Lisa. Therefore, he could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n5. **After 5pm**: The dance studio was closed after 5pm, so David could not have gone to the dance studio after this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame during which David could have gone to the dance studio is between 11am and 12pm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B) 11am to 12pm>>>"
