    "To determine the time frame during which Hannah could have gone to the beach, we need to analyze the information provided about her activities throughout the day:\n\n1. **Hannah woke up at 5am.**\n   - This indicates that any activity she does will be after 5am.\n\n2. **Richard saw Hannah sitting on a rooftop from 5am to 7am.**\n   - This means Hannah was occupied from 5am to 7am and could not have gone to the beach during this time.\n\n3. **Ashley saw Hannah getting a coffee at the cafe from 9am to 7pm.**\n   - This indicates that Hannah was at the cafe from 9am to 7pm, so she could not have gone to the beach during this period.\n\n4. **Jennifer saw Hannah taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7pm to 8pm.**\n   - This means Hannah was occupied from 7pm to 8pm, so she could not have gone to the beach during this time.\n\n5. **The beach was closed after 8pm.**\n   - This means Hannah could not have gone to the beach after 8pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 7pm to 8pm:** Hannah was taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa during this time, so she could not have gone to the beach.\n\n- **Option (B) 7am to 9am:** This is a potential time frame when Hannah could have gone to the beach, as there are no activities listed for her during this period.\n\n- **Option (C) 9am to 7pm:** Hannah was at the cafe during this time, so she could not have gone to the beach.\n\n- **Option (D) 5am to 7am:** Hannah was sitting on a rooftop during this time, so she could not have gone to the beach.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame when Hannah could have gone to the beach is between 7am and 9am.\n\n<<<B>>>"
