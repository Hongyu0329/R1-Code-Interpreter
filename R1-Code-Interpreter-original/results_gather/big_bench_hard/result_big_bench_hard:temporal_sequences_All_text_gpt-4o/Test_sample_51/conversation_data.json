    "To determine when William could have gone to the bookstore, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **William's Day Start:**\n   - William woke up at 7am.\n\n2. **Activities and Observations:**\n   - 7am to 8am: Tiffany saw William working out at the gym.\n   - 12pm to 1pm: Sean saw William driving to the water park.\n   - 1pm to 3pm: Anthony saw William waiting at the train station.\n   - 3pm to 5pm: James saw William taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.\n   - 5pm to 7pm: Jessica saw William working at the office.\n\n3. **Bookstore Closing Time:**\n   - The bookstore was closed after 7pm.\n\n4. **Available Time Slots:**\n   - We need to find a time slot when William was not seen by anyone and the bookstore was open.\n\n5. **Analysis of Time Slots:**\n   - **7am to 8am:** William was at the gym.\n   - **8am to 12pm:** No one saw William during this time, making it a potential time slot for visiting the bookstore.\n   - **12pm to 1pm:** William was seen driving to the water park.\n   - **1pm to 3pm:** William was seen at the train station.\n   - **3pm to 5pm:** William was seen taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.\n   - **5pm to 7pm:** William was seen working at the office.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time slot when William was not seen by anyone and the bookstore was open is from 8am to 12pm.\n\nTherefore, the time when William could have gone to the bookstore is:\n\n<<<D) 8am to 12pm>>>"
