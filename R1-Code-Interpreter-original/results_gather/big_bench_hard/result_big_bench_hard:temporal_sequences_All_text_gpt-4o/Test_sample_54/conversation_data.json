    "To determine when Emily could have gone to the bakery, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and see where there are gaps that would allow her to visit the bakery.\n\n1. **Emily's Schedule:**\n   - Emily woke up at 5am.\n   - From 6am to 7am, Nancy saw Emily sitting on a rooftop.\n   - From 7am to 8am, Betty saw Emily reading at the library.\n   - From 8am to 6pm, Jason saw Emily buying lunch at the deli.\n   - From 6pm to 7pm, David saw Emily attending class at the school.\n   - From 7pm to 10pm, Samantha saw Emily driving to the water park.\n   - The bakery was closed after 10pm.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - **Option (A) 5am to 6am:** Emily woke up at 5am, and there is no activity mentioned until 6am. Therefore, she could have gone to the bakery between 5am and 6am.\n   - **Option (B) 8am to 6pm:** Emily was seen buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 6pm, so she could not have gone to the bakery during this time.\n   - **Option (C) 6pm to 7pm:** Emily was attending class at the school from 6pm to 7pm, so she could not have gone to the bakery during this time.\n   - **Option (D) 7am to 8am:** Emily was reading at the library from 7am to 8am, so she could not have gone to the bakery during this time.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time Emily could have gone to the bakery is between 5am and 6am, as there are no other gaps in her schedule that coincide with the bakery's operating hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
