    "To determine the time frame during which Betty could have gone to the bookstore, we need to analyze the information provided about her activities throughout the day:\n\n1. **Betty's Schedule:**\n   - Betty woke up at 6am.\n   - From 6am to 7am, Betty was seen stretching at a yoga studio.\n   - From 8am to 5pm, Betty was seen buying cookies at a bakery.\n   - From 5pm to 8pm, Betty was seen waiting at the train station.\n   - The bookstore was closed after 8pm.\n\n2. **Analysis of Time Slots:**\n   - **6am to 7am:** Betty was at the yoga studio, so she could not have gone to the bookstore during this time.\n   - **7am to 8am:** There is no information about Betty's activities during this time, so it is possible she could have gone to the bookstore.\n   - **8am to 5pm:** Betty was at the bakery, so she could not have gone to the bookstore during this time.\n   - **5pm to 8pm:** Betty was at the train station, so she could not have gone to the bookstore during this time.\n   - After 8pm, the bookstore was closed, so she could not have gone then.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time slot where there is no conflicting activity and the bookstore is open is from 7am to 8am.\n\nTherefore, the time frame during which Betty could have gone to the bookstore is from 7am to 8am.\n\n<<<A>>>"
