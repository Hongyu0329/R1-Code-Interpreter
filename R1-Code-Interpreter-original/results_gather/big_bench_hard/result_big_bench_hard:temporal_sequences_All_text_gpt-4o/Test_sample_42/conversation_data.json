    "To determine when David could have gone to the museum, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the museum's closing time.\n\n1. **David's Wake-Up Time:**\n   - David woke up at 8am.\n\n2. **Tennis Activity:**\n   - Steven saw David playing tennis from 10am to 11am.\n\n3. **Yoga Studio Activity:**\n   - James saw David stretching at a yoga studio from 11am to 4pm.\n\n4. **Gym Activity:**\n   - Nancy saw David working out at the gym from 4pm to 5pm.\n\n5. **Deli Activity:**\n   - Richard saw David buying lunch at the deli from 5pm to 6pm.\n\n6. **Museum Closing Time:**\n   - The museum was closed after 6pm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 8am to 10am:**\n  - David woke up at 8am, and there are no activities scheduled until 10am. Therefore, David could have gone to the museum between 8am and 10am.\n\n- **Option (B) 11am to 4pm:**\n  - David was seen stretching at a yoga studio from 11am to 4pm, so he could not have gone to the museum during this time.\n\n- **Option (C) 10am to 11am:**\n  - David was seen playing tennis from 10am to 11am, so he could not have gone to the museum during this time.\n\n- **Option (D) 5pm to 6pm:**\n  - David was seen buying lunch at the deli from 5pm to 6pm, so he could not have gone to the museum during this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time David could have gone to the museum is between 8am and 10am.\n\nFinal answer: <<<A>>>."
