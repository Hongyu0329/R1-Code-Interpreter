    "To determine when David could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **David woke up at 8am.**\n   - This is the earliest time David could have started any activity.\n\n2. **Elizabeth saw David waiting at the airport from 10am to 1pm.**\n   - David was occupied during this entire time period.\n\n3. **David saw David playing tennis at the tennis court from 1pm to 2pm.**\n   - David was occupied during this entire time period.\n\n4. **Jessica saw David working out at the gym from 2pm to 3pm.**\n   - David was occupied during this entire time period.\n\n5. **Susan saw David waiting at the train station from 3pm to 4pm.**\n   - David was occupied during this entire time period.\n\n6. **Sean saw David sitting on a rooftop from 4pm to 6pm.**\n   - David was occupied during this entire time period.\n\n7. **The coffee shop was closed after 6pm.**\n   - David could not have gone to the coffee shop after 6pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 3pm to 4pm:**\n  - David was seen at the train station during this time, so he could not have been at the coffee shop.\n\n- **Option (B) 10am to 1pm:**\n  - David was seen at the airport during this time, so he could not have been at the coffee shop.\n\n- **Option (C) 8am to 10am:**\n  - David woke up at 8am and was not reported to be anywhere else until 10am. This is a possible time for him to have gone to the coffee shop.\n\n- **Option (D) 1pm to 2pm:**\n  - David was seen playing tennis during this time, so he could not have been at the coffee shop.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time David could have gone to the coffee shop is between 8am and 10am.\n\n<<<C>>>"
