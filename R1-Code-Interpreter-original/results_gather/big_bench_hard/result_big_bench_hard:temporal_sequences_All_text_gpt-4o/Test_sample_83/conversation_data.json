    "To determine when Elizabeth could have gone to the park, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and the park's operating hours.\n\n1. **Elizabeth's Schedule:**\n   - Elizabeth woke up at 10am.\n   - From 10am to 11am, Emily saw Elizabeth at the bike shop.\n   - From 11am to 2pm, Leslie saw Elizabeth at the deli.\n   - From 4pm to 8pm, Sarah saw Elizabeth at the tennis court.\n\n2. **Park's Operating Hours:**\n   - The park was closed after 8pm.\n\n3. **Analysis of Available Time:**\n   - Elizabeth was busy from 10am to 11am at the bike shop.\n   - She was also busy from 11am to 2pm at the deli.\n   - From 4pm to 8pm, she was occupied at the tennis court.\n   - Therefore, the only time slot not accounted for in her schedule is from 2pm to 4pm.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time Elizabeth could have gone to the park is between 2pm and 4pm, as this is the only period when she is not reported to be elsewhere and the park is open.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D) 2pm to 4pm>>>"
