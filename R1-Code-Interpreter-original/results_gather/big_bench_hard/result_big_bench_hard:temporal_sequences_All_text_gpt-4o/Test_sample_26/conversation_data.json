    "To determine when David could have gone to the gas station, we need to analyze the timeline of David's activities throughout the day:\n\n1. **7am to 12pm**: Michael saw David at the train station. This means David was occupied during this time and could not have gone to the gas station.\n\n2. **12pm to 2pm**: Thomas saw David on a rooftop. David was occupied during this time as well.\n\n3. **2pm to 3pm**: Tiffany saw David at the cafe. David was occupied during this time.\n\n4. **3pm to 5pm**: James saw David at the electronic store. David was occupied during this time.\n\n5. **5pm to 6pm**: Mark saw David at the library. David was occupied during this time.\n\n6. **After 6pm**: There is no information about David's activities after 6pm, and the gas station was closed after 8pm. Therefore, David could have gone to the gas station between 6pm and 8pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **(A) 2pm to 3pm**: David was at the cafe, so this is not possible.\n- **(B) 6pm to 8pm**: There is no information about David's activities during this time, and the gas station was open, so this is possible.\n- **(C) 5pm to 6pm**: David was at the library, so this is not possible.\n- **(D) 7am to 12pm**: David was at the train station, so this is not possible.\n\nThe only time frame when David could have gone to the gas station is between 6pm and 8pm.\n\n<<<B>>>"
