    "To determine when Kimberly could have gone to the football field, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **6am to 8am**: Kimberly was seen by William at the electronics store.\n2. **8am to 9am**: Kimberly was seen by Jason at the train station.\n3. **9am to 1pm**: Kimberly was seen by Tiffany walking towards the Statue of Liberty.\n4. **1pm to 3pm**: There is no information about Kimberly's activities during this time.\n5. **3pm to 8pm**: Kimberly was seen by Linda at the yoga studio.\n6. **8pm to 9pm**: Kimberly was seen by Sean driving to the water park.\n7. **After 9pm**: The football field was closed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 8am to 9am**: Kimberly was seen at the train station during this time, so she could not have been at the football field.\n- **Option (B) 9am to 1pm**: Kimberly was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so she could not have been at the football field.\n- **Option (C) 1pm to 3pm**: There is no information about Kimberly's activities during this time, so it is possible she could have gone to the football field.\n- **Option (D) 8pm to 9pm**: Kimberly was seen driving to the water park, so she could not have been at the football field.\n\nThe only time Kimberly could have gone to the football field is between 1pm and 3pm, as there is no conflicting information for this time period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
