    "To determine when William could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the coffee shop's operating hours.\n\n1. **William's Schedule:**\n   - William woke up at 9am.\n   - From 9am to 11am, William was seen playing tennis.\n   - From 11am to 1pm, William was attending class.\n   - From 6pm to 7pm, William was walking in the garden.\n\n2. **Coffee Shop Hours:**\n   - The coffee shop was closed after 7pm.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options:**\n   - **Option (A) 6pm to 7pm:** During this time, William was seen walking in the garden, so he could not have been at the coffee shop.\n   - **Option (B) 9am to 11am:** During this time, William was playing tennis, so he could not have been at the coffee shop.\n   - **Option (C) 11am to 1pm:** During this time, William was attending class, so he could not have been at the coffee shop.\n   - **Option (D) 1pm to 6pm:** There is no record of William's activities during this time, and the coffee shop was open, so this is a possible time for him to have gone to the coffee shop.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time William could have gone to the coffee shop is between 1pm and 6pm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
