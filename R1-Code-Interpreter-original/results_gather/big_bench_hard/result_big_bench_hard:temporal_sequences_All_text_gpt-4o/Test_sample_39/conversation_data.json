    "To determine when Andrew could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to analyze the timeline of events and identify any gaps where Andrew was not seen by anyone else.\n\n1. **Andrew's Day:**\n   - Andrew woke up at 8am.\n   - From 11am to 3pm, Elizabeth saw Andrew at the electronic store.\n   - From 3pm to 4pm, Jennifer saw Andrew at the bike shop.\n   - From 4pm to 6pm, Anthony saw Andrew at the bakery.\n   - From 6pm to 8pm, Betty saw Andrew at the theater.\n   - The coffee shop was closed after 8pm.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Timeline:**\n   - **8am to 11am:** Andrew is not accounted for during this time. He could have gone to the coffee shop.\n   - **11am to 3pm:** Andrew was seen at the electronic store, so he could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n   - **3pm to 4pm:** Andrew was seen at the bike shop, so he could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n   - **4pm to 6pm:** Andrew was seen at the bakery, so he could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n   - **6pm to 8pm:** Andrew was seen at the theater, so he could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n   - **After 8pm:** The coffee shop was closed, so Andrew could not have gone after this time.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time Andrew is unaccounted for and the coffee shop is open is between 8am and 11am.\n\nTherefore, the time Andrew could have gone to the coffee shop is between 8am and 11am.\n\n<<<C>>>"
