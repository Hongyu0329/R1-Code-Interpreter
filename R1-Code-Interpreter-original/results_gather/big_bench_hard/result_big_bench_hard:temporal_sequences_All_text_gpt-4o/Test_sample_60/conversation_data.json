    "To determine when Thomas could have gone to the gas station, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **Thomas woke up at 8am.**\n   - This means he could not have gone to the gas station before 8am.\n\n2. **Samantha saw Thomas stretching at a yoga studio from 9am to 12pm.**\n   - Thomas was occupied during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station between 9am and 12pm.\n\n3. **Thomas saw Thomas buying cookies at a bakery from 12pm to 1pm.**\n   - Thomas was at the bakery during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station between 12pm and 1pm.\n\n4. **Kimberly saw Thomas working at the office from 1pm to 4pm.**\n   - Thomas was at the office during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station between 1pm and 4pm.\n\n5. **Andrew saw Thomas waiting at the train station from 4pm to 5pm.**\n   - Thomas was at the train station during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station between 4pm and 5pm.\n\n6. **Ashley saw Thomas buying clothes at the mall from 5pm to 8pm.**\n   - Thomas was at the mall during this time, so he could not have gone to the gas station between 5pm and 8pm.\n\n7. **The gas station was closed after 8pm.**\n   - Thomas could not have gone to the gas station after 8pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **(A) 8am to 9am:** Thomas was awake and not occupied during this time, so he could have gone to the gas station.\n- **(B) 12pm to 1pm:** Thomas was at the bakery, so he could not have gone to the gas station.\n- **(C) 5pm to 8pm:** Thomas was at the mall, so he could not have gone to the gas station.\n- **(D) 1pm to 4pm:** Thomas was at the office, so he could not have gone to the gas station.\n\nThe only time Thomas was free and the gas station was open is between 8am and 9am.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<A>>>."
