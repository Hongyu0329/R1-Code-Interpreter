    "To determine when Leslie could have gone to the swimming pool, we need to analyze the timeline of Leslie's activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. Leslie woke up at 5am.\n2. From 5am to 8am, Leslie was seen sitting on a rooftop by Sarah.\n3. From 8am to 12pm, Leslie was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty by William.\n4. From 12pm to 2pm, Leslie was seen stretching at a yoga studio by Susan.\n5. From 4pm to 6pm, Leslie was seen working at the office by John.\n6. From 6pm to 10pm, Leslie was seen getting a coffee at the cafe by Emily.\n7. The swimming pool was closed after 10pm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the available time slots:\n\n- **5am to 8am**: Leslie was seen on the rooftop, so they could not have gone to the swimming pool during this time.\n- **8am to 12pm**: Leslie was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so they could not have gone to the swimming pool during this time.\n- **12pm to 2pm**: Leslie was seen at the yoga studio, so they could not have gone to the swimming pool during this time.\n- **2pm to 4pm**: There is no information about Leslie's activities during this time, so it is possible that Leslie could have gone to the swimming pool.\n- **4pm to 6pm**: Leslie was seen working at the office, so they could not have gone to the swimming pool during this time.\n- **6pm to 10pm**: Leslie was seen at the cafe, so they could not have gone to the swimming pool during this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time slot when Leslie could have gone to the swimming pool is from 2pm to 4pm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B) 2pm to 4pm>>>"
