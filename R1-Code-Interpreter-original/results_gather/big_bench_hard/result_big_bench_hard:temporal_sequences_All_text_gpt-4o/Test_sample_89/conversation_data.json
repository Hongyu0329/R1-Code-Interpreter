    "To determine when James could have gone to the swimming pool, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **James woke up at 5am.**\n   - This means any activity, including going to the swimming pool, could only start after 5am.\n\n2. **Ashley saw James sitting on a rooftop from 7am to 9am.**\n   - James was occupied during this time, so he could not have gone to the swimming pool between 7am and 9am.\n\n3. **Hannah saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 7pm.**\n   - James was occupied during this time as well, so he could not have gone to the swimming pool between 9am and 7pm.\n\n4. **William saw James buying cookies at a bakery from 7pm to 8pm.**\n   - James was occupied during this time, so he could not have gone to the swimming pool between 7pm and 8pm.\n\n5. **Linda saw James waiting at the train station from 8pm to 10pm.**\n   - James was occupied during this time, so he could not have gone to the swimming pool between 8pm and 10pm.\n\n6. **The swimming pool was closed after 10pm.**\n   - This means James could not have gone to the swimming pool after 10pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **(A) 7pm to 8pm:** James was buying cookies at a bakery during this time, so this option is not possible.\n- **(B) 8pm to 10pm:** James was waiting at the train station during this time, so this option is not possible.\n- **(C) 5am to 7am:** James was not reported to be doing anything during this time, so this is a possible time for him to have gone to the swimming pool.\n- **(D) 7am to 9am:** James was sitting on a rooftop during this time, so this option is not possible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time James could have gone to the swimming pool is between 5am and 7am.\n\n<<<C>>>"
