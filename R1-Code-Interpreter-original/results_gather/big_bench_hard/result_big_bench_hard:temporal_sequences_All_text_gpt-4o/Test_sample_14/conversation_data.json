    "To determine when Leslie could have gone to the clothing store, we need to analyze the given information and eliminate the time periods when Leslie was confirmed to be elsewhere.\n\n1. **Leslie's Schedule:**\n   - Leslie woke up at 5am.\n   - From 5am to 7am, Leslie was seen buying a phone at the electronics store.\n   - From 11am to 6pm, Leslie was seen waiting at the airport.\n   - From 6pm to 10pm, Leslie was attending class at the school.\n\n2. **Clothing Store Hours:**\n   - The clothing store was closed after 10pm.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options:**\n   - **Option (A) 11am to 6pm:** During this time, Leslie was seen at the airport, so this option is not possible.\n   - **Option (B) 5am to 7am:** During this time, Leslie was seen at the electronics store, so this option is not possible.\n   - **Option (C) 7am to 11am:** There is no information about Leslie's whereabouts during this time, so it is possible that Leslie went to the clothing store during this period.\n   - **Option (D) 6pm to 10pm:** During this time, Leslie was attending class at the school, so this option is not possible.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time period when Leslie's whereabouts are not accounted for, and thus could have gone to the clothing store, is from 7am to 11am.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
