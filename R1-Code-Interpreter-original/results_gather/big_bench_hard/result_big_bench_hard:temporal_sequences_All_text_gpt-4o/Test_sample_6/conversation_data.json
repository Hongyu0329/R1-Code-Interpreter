    "To determine when Ashley could have gone to the bookstore, we need to analyze the timeline of Ashley's activities throughout the day:\n\n1. **7am**: Ashley woke up.\n2. **11am to 12pm**: Leslie saw Ashley at the bike shop.\n3. **12pm to 4pm**: Susan saw Ashley at the gym.\n4. **4pm to 7pm**: Elizabeth saw Ashley at the train station.\n5. **7pm to 9pm**: Emily saw Ashley near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n6. **After 9pm**: The bookstore was closed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 7pm to 9pm**: During this time, Emily saw Ashley taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, so Ashley could not have been at the bookstore.\n\n- **Option (B) 11am to 12pm**: During this time, Leslie saw Ashley at the bike shop, so Ashley could not have been at the bookstore.\n\n- **Option (C) 12pm to 4pm**: During this time, Susan saw Ashley at the gym, so Ashley could not have been at the bookstore.\n\n- **Option (D) 7am to 11am**: There is no record of Ashley's activities during this time. Ashley woke up at 7am, and the first recorded activity is at 11am at the bike shop. Therefore, Ashley could have gone to the bookstore between 7am and 11am.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Ashley could have gone to the bookstore is between 7am and 11am.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<D>>>."
