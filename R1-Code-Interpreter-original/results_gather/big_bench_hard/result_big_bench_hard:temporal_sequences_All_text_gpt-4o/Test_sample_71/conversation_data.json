    "To determine when James could have gone to the swimming pool, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the pool's operating hours.\n\n1. **James's Wake-Up Time:**\n   - James woke up at 12pm. This means he could not have done anything before 12pm.\n\n2. **James's Activities:**\n   - From 2pm to 4pm, John saw James taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Therefore, James was occupied during this time.\n   - From 4pm to 5pm, William saw James buying a bike at the bike shop. James was occupied during this time as well.\n   - From 5pm to 8pm, Jennifer saw James getting a coffee at the cafe. James was occupied during this time too.\n\n3. **Swimming Pool Hours:**\n   - The swimming pool was closed after 8pm. Therefore, James could not have gone to the pool after 8pm.\n\n4. **Available Time for Swimming:**\n   - Since James was occupied from 2pm to 8pm, the only available time for him to go to the swimming pool would be between 12pm and 2pm.\n\n5. **Options Analysis:**\n   - (A) 4pm to 5pm: James was buying a bike, so this is not possible.\n   - (B) 5pm to 8pm: James was getting a coffee, so this is not possible.\n   - (C) 12pm to 2pm: This is the only time James was free and the pool was open.\n   - (D) 2pm to 4pm: James was taking photos, so this is not possible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time James could have gone to the swimming pool is between 12pm and 2pm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
