    "To determine when Betty could have gone to the dance studio, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities based on the information provided:\n\n1. **7am to 9am**: Samantha saw Betty getting a coffee at the cafe. This means Betty was at the cafe during this time.\n\n2. **9am to 2pm**: Leslie saw Betty waiting at the airport. This indicates that Betty was at the airport during this time.\n\n3. **2pm to 5pm**: There is no information about Betty's whereabouts during this time. This is a potential window when she could have gone to the dance studio.\n\n4. **5pm to 6pm**: Susan saw Betty working at the office. This means Betty was at the office during this time.\n\n5. **6pm to 8pm**: Richard saw Betty waiting at the train station. This indicates that Betty was at the train station during this time.\n\n6. **After 8pm**: The dance studio was closed, so Betty could not have gone to the dance studio after 8pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **(A) 2pm to 5pm**: This is a possible time frame for Betty to have gone to the dance studio, as there is no conflicting information about her whereabouts during this period.\n\n- **(B) 7am to 9am**: Betty was seen at the cafe, so she could not have been at the dance studio during this time.\n\n- **(C) 5pm to 6pm**: Betty was seen working at the office, so she could not have been at the dance studio during this time.\n\n- **(D) 9am to 2pm**: Betty was seen at the airport, so she could not have been at the dance studio during this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame when Betty could have gone to the dance studio is from 2pm to 5pm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
