    "To determine when William could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **William's Schedule:**\n   - 6am to 9am: William was at the library.\n   - 9am to 3pm: William was at the airport.\n   - 4pm to 6pm: William was at the tennis court.\n   - 6pm to 9pm: William was at the office.\n   - 9pm to 10pm: William was at the gym.\n\n2. **Coffee Shop Hours:**\n   - The coffee shop was closed after 10pm.\n\n3. **Analysis of Available Time Slots:**\n   - **Before 6am:** William was asleep, as he woke up at 6am.\n   - **9am to 3pm:** William was at the airport, so he couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n   - **3pm to 4pm:** This is a potential time slot when William was not accounted for by any of the witnesses.\n   - **4pm to 6pm:** William was playing tennis, so he couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n   - **6pm to 9pm:** William was working at the office, so he couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n   - **9pm to 10pm:** William was at the gym, so he couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n   - **After 10pm:** The coffee shop was closed.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time slot when William was not accounted for and the coffee shop was open is from 3pm to 4pm.\n\nTherefore, the time when William could have gone to the coffee shop is between 3pm and 4pm.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
