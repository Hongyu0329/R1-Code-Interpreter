    "To determine when Sarah could have gone to the construction site, we need to analyze her schedule and identify any gaps where she was not seen by anyone else.\n\n1. **Sarah's Schedule:**\n   - Woke up at 6am.\n   - 8am to 2pm: Seen by Nancy at the electronic store.\n   - 2pm to 3pm: Seen by Betty driving to the water park.\n   - 3pm to 4pm: Seen by Kimberly at the mall.\n   - 4pm to 6pm: Seen by Emily at the bakery.\n   - 6pm to 8pm: Seen by David at the school.\n   - The construction site was closed after 8pm.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Gaps:**\n   - **6am to 8am:** Sarah is not accounted for during this time. She could have gone to the construction site.\n   - **8am to 2pm:** Sarah was at the electronic store, so she could not have gone to the construction site.\n   - **2pm to 3pm:** Sarah was driving to the water park, so she could not have gone to the construction site.\n   - **3pm to 4pm:** Sarah was at the mall, so she could not have gone to the construction site.\n   - **4pm to 6pm:** Sarah was at the bakery, so she could not have gone to the construction site.\n   - **6pm to 8pm:** Sarah was at the school, so she could not have gone to the construction site.\n   - After 8pm, the construction site was closed.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time Sarah is unaccounted for and the construction site is open is between 6am and 8am.\n\nTherefore, the time Sarah could have gone to the construction site is:\n\n<<<C) 6am to 8am>>>"
