    "To determine when Jennifer could have gone to the dance studio, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities based on the information provided:\n\n1. **8am to 10am**: Jennifer was seen by Linda buying cookies at a bakery. Therefore, she could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n2. **10am to 2pm**: Jennifer was seen by William walking in the garden. Therefore, she could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n3. **2pm to 6pm**: Jennifer was seen by Tiffany waiting at the train station. Therefore, she could not have gone to the dance studio during this time.\n\n4. **After 6pm**: There is no information about Jennifer's activities after 6pm. The dance studio was closed after 10pm, so Jennifer could have gone to the dance studio between 6pm and 10pm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only time frame when Jennifer could have gone to the dance studio is between 6pm and 10pm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B) 6pm to 10pm>>>"
