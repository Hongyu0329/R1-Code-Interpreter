    "To determine when Mark could have gone to the bookstore, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the bookstore's hours.\n\n1. **Mark's Schedule:**\n   - Mark woke up at 5am.\n   - From 5am to 10am, Mark was seen stretching at a yoga studio.\n   - From 10am to 5pm, Mark was attending class at the school.\n   - From 5pm to 8pm, Mark was sitting on a rooftop.\n   - From 9pm to 10pm, Mark was walking in the garden.\n\n2. **Bookstore Hours:**\n   - The bookstore was closed after 10pm.\n\n3. **Analysis of Available Time Slots:**\n   - **5am to 10am:** Mark was at the yoga studio.\n   - **10am to 5pm:** Mark was attending class.\n   - **5pm to 8pm:** Mark was on a rooftop.\n   - **8pm to 9pm:** This time slot is not accounted for in Mark's schedule, so he could have gone to the bookstore during this time.\n   - **9pm to 10pm:** Mark was walking in the garden.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time slot where Mark's activities are not accounted for and the bookstore is open is from 8pm to 9pm.\n\nTherefore, the time between which Mark could have gone to the bookstore is 8pm to 9pm.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<A>>>."
