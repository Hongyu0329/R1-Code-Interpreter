    "To determine the time frame during which Ashley could have gone to the bookstore, we need to analyze the given information and eliminate the time periods when Ashley was confirmed to be elsewhere.\n\n1. **Ashley woke up at 5am.**\n   - This means Ashley was available to go to the bookstore any time after 5am.\n\n2. **Jason saw Ashley buying lunch at the deli from 11am to 1pm.**\n   - During this time, Ashley was at the deli, so she could not have been at the bookstore.\n\n3. **Emily saw Ashley driving to the water park from 1pm to 3pm.**\n   - During this time, Ashley was driving to the water park, so she could not have been at the bookstore.\n\n4. **Kimberly saw Ashley stretching at a yoga studio from 3pm to 6pm.**\n   - During this time, Ashley was at the yoga studio, so she could not have been at the bookstore.\n\n5. **The bookstore was closed after 6pm.**\n   - This means Ashley could not have gone to the bookstore after 6pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 1pm to 3pm:** Ashley was seen driving to the water park during this time, so she could not have been at the bookstore.\n- **Option (B) 11am to 1pm:** Ashley was seen buying lunch at the deli during this time, so she could not have been at the bookstore.\n- **Option (C) 3pm to 6pm:** Ashley was seen stretching at the yoga studio during this time, so she could not have been at the bookstore.\n- **Option (D) 5am to 11am:** Ashley was not reported to be anywhere specific during this time, so she could have gone to the bookstore.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time frame during which Ashley could have gone to the bookstore is from 5am to 11am.\n\n<<<D>>>"
