    "To determine when Sarah could have gone to the bakery, we need to analyze her schedule and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **Sarah's Wake-Up Time:**\n   - Sarah woke up at 9am. This means she could not have gone to the bakery before 9am.\n\n2. **Sarah's Activities:**\n   - John saw Sarah getting a coffee at the cafe from 10am to 12pm. This means Sarah was occupied during this time and could not have gone to the bakery.\n   - Thomas saw Sarah buying lunch at the deli from 12pm to 4pm. This means Sarah was occupied during this time and could not have gone to the bakery.\n   - Richard saw Sarah driving to the water park from 4pm to 5pm. This means Sarah was occupied during this time and could not have gone to the bakery.\n\n3. **Bakery's Closing Time:**\n   - The bakery was closed after 5pm. This means Sarah could not have gone to the bakery after 5pm.\n\n4. **Possible Time Slots:**\n   - The only time slot left for Sarah to visit the bakery is between 9am and 10am, as she woke up at 9am and was seen at the cafe starting at 10am.\n\n5. **Options Analysis:**\n   - (A) 4pm to 5pm: Sarah was driving to the water park, so she could not have gone to the bakery.\n   - (B) 12pm to 4pm: Sarah was buying lunch at the deli, so she could not have gone to the bakery.\n   - (C) 9am to 10am: This is the only time slot where Sarah was not seen elsewhere and the bakery was open.\n   - (D) 10am to 12pm: Sarah was getting coffee at the cafe, so she could not have gone to the bakery.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only viable time for Sarah to have gone to the bakery is between 9am and 10am.\n\n<<<C>>>"
