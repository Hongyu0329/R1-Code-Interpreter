    "To determine when Jessica could have gone to the swimming pool, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and the pool's closing time.\n\n1. **Jessica's Schedule:**\n   - Jessica woke up at 9am.\n   - From 9am to 11am, Richard saw Jessica taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n   - From 11am to 3pm, Mary saw Jessica reading at the library.\n   - From 3pm to 4pm, Kimberly saw Jessica sitting on a rooftop.\n\n2. **Swimming Pool Closing Time:**\n   - The swimming pool was closed after 7pm.\n\n3. **Analysis of Available Time:**\n   - From 9am to 11am, Jessica was taking photos, so she could not have gone to the pool during this time. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n   - From 11am to 3pm, Jessica was at the library, so she could not have gone to the pool during this time. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.\n   - From 3pm to 4pm, Jessica was on a rooftop, so she could not have gone to the pool during this time. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n   - After 4pm, Jessica is not accounted for until the pool closes at 7pm. Therefore, the only available time for Jessica to have gone to the swimming pool is from 4pm to 7pm.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only time Jessica could have gone to the swimming pool is between 4pm and 7pm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
