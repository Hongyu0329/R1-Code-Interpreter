    "To determine when Susan could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **Susan's Schedule:**\n   - Susan woke up at 7am.\n   - From 7am to 11am, Linda saw Susan driving to the water park.\n   - From 11am to 12pm, John saw Susan buying clothes at the mall.\n   - From 12pm to 1pm, Jessica saw Susan taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.\n   - From 1pm to 2pm, Steven saw Susan buying lunch at the deli.\n   - From 2pm to 6pm, Thomas saw Susan reading at the library.\n\n2. **Coffee Shop Hours:**\n   - The coffee shop was closed after 9pm.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options:**\n   - **Option (A) 6pm to 9pm:** This is a possible time frame since there are no activities scheduled for Susan between 6pm and 9pm, and the coffee shop is open during this time.\n   - **Option (B) 7am to 11am:** This time frame is not possible because Susan was seen driving to the water park during this entire period.\n   - **Option (C) 1pm to 2pm:** This time frame is not possible because Susan was seen buying lunch at the deli during this time.\n   - **Option (D) 2pm to 6pm:** This time frame is not possible because Susan was seen reading at the library during this entire period.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Susan could have gone to the coffee shop is between 6pm and 9pm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
