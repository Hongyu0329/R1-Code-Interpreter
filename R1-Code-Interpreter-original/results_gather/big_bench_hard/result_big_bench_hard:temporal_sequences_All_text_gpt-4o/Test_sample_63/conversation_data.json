    "To determine the time frame during which Samantha could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities based on the information provided:\n\n1. **6am to 10am**: Samantha was at the theater watching a movie. Therefore, she could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n\n2. **10am to 11am**: Samantha was seen driving to the water park. This implies she was in transit and not at the coffee shop during this time.\n\n3. **11am to 6pm**: Samantha was seen stretching at a yoga studio. This means she was occupied and could not have visited the coffee shop during this period.\n\n4. **After 6pm**: The only remaining time frame is after 6pm. The coffee shop was closed after 8pm, so the window of opportunity for Samantha to visit the coffee shop is between 6pm and 8pm.\n\nNow, let's match this analysis with the given options:\n\n- (A) 11am to 6pm: Samantha was at the yoga studio, so this is not possible.\n- (B) 10am to 11am: Samantha was driving to the water park, so this is not possible.\n- (C) 6am to 10am: Samantha was at the theater, so this is not possible.\n- (D) 6pm to 8pm: This is the only time frame that fits, as Samantha was not reported to be elsewhere and the coffee shop was open.\n\nTherefore, the time frame during which Samantha could have gone to the coffee shop is between 6pm and 8pm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
