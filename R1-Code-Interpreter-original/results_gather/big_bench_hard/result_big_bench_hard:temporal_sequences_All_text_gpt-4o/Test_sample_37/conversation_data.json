    "To determine when James could have gone to the dance studio, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. **James woke up at 7am.**\n   - This is the start of the timeline for James's activities.\n\n2. **Thomas saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 7am to 12pm.**\n   - James was occupied from 7am to 12pm.\n\n3. **Mark saw James driving to the water park from 12pm to 2pm.**\n   - James was occupied from 12pm to 2pm.\n\n4. **Anthony saw James buying a phone at the electronics store from 2pm to 4pm.**\n   - James was occupied from 2pm to 4pm.\n\n5. **Sarah saw James buying lunch at the deli from 5pm to 6pm.**\n   - James was occupied from 5pm to 6pm.\n\n6. **The dance studio was closed after 6pm.**\n   - James cannot go to the dance studio after 6pm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 2pm to 4pm:**\n  - James was seen buying a phone at the electronics store during this time, so he could not have gone to the dance studio.\n\n- **Option (B) 7am to 12pm:**\n  - James was seen taking photos near the Eiffel Tower during this time, so he could not have gone to the dance studio.\n\n- **Option (C) 4pm to 5pm:**\n  - There is no record of James's activities during this time. This is a potential time slot when he could have gone to the dance studio.\n\n- **Option (D) 12pm to 2pm:**\n  - James was seen driving to the water park during this time, so he could not have gone to the dance studio.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time James could have gone to the dance studio is between 4pm and 5pm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
