    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) obnoxious big prismlike orange Filipino glass knife\n- obnoxious (opinion)\n- big (size)\n- prismlike (shape)\n- orange (color)\n- Filipino (proper adjective/nationality)\n- glass (material)\n- knife (noun)\n\n(B) obnoxious big prismlike Filipino orange glass knife\n- obnoxious (opinion)\n- big (size)\n- prismlike (shape)\n- Filipino (proper adjective/nationality)\n- orange (color)\n- glass (material)\n- knife (noun)\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: opinion, size, shape, color, proper adjective, material, and then the noun. \n\nLet's compare the two options:\n- Option (A) follows the order: opinion, size, shape, color, proper adjective, material, noun.\n- Option (B) follows the order: opinion, size, shape, proper adjective, color, material, noun.\n\nOption (A) is the correct order because it places the color before the proper adjective, which aligns with the standard order of adjectives.\n\n<<<A>>>"
