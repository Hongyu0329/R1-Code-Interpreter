    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to consider the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options:\n\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective indicating nationality.\n- \"computer\" is the noun.\n\nAccording to the standard order, the quality or opinion adjective should come before the proper adjective. Therefore, the correct order should be \"nice American computer.\"\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the order programmatically.\n\n```python\n# Define the adjectives and their order\nadjective_order = {\n    \"quantity\": 1,\n    \"quality\": 2,\n    \"size\": 3,\n    \"age\": 4,\n    \"shape\": 5,\n    \"color\": 6,\n    \"proper\": 7,\n    \"purpose\": 8\n}\n\n# Define the adjectives in the options\noption_a = [\"nice\", \"American\"]\noption_b = [\"American\", \"nice\"]\n\n# Define a function to get the order of adjectives\ndef get_adjective_order(adjectives):\n    order = []\n    for adj in adjectives:\n        if adj == \"nice\":\n            order.append(adjective_order[\"quality\"])\n        elif adj == \"American\":\n            order.append(adjective_order[\"proper\"])\n    return order\n\n# Check the order for both options\norder_a = get_adjective_order(option_a)\norder_b = get_adjective_order(option_b)\n\n# Determine which option has the correct order\ncorrect_option = \"A\" if order_a == sorted(order_a) else \"B\"\n\nprint(correct_option)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine the correct option.",
    "The code execution confirms that option (A) \"nice American computer\" follows the correct adjective order according to the standard rules of English grammar. The quality or opinion adjective \"nice\" comes before the proper adjective \"American.\"\n\n<<<A>>>"
