    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) tiny whittling grey brand-new Indian triangular dog\n- tiny: size\n- whittling: not a standard adjective, possibly a mistake or a verb form\n- grey: color\n- brand-new: age\n- Indian: proper adjective (nationality)\n- triangular: shape\n\n(B) tiny brand-new triangular grey Indian whittling dog\n- tiny: size\n- brand-new: age\n- triangular: shape\n- grey: color\n- Indian: proper adjective (nationality)\n- whittling: not a standard adjective, possibly a mistake or a verb form\n\nNow, let's compare the order of adjectives in both options with the standard order:\n\n- Option (A) has the order: size, verb form, color, age, nationality, shape\n- Option (B) has the order: size, age, shape, color, nationality, verb form\n\nOption (B) follows the standard adjective order more closely than option (A), except for the inclusion of \"whittling,\" which seems out of place in both options. However, ignoring \"whittling,\" option (B) is more consistent with the typical adjective order.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is option (B).\n\n<<<(B) tiny brand-new triangular grey Indian whittling dog>>>"
