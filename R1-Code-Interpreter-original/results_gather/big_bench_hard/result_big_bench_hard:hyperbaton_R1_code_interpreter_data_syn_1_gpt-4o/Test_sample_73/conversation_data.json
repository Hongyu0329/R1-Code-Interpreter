    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to consider the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"old\" and \"drinking.\" \n\n- \"Old\" is an adjective that describes age.\n- \"Drinking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective, as it describes the function or activity associated with the noun.\n\nAccording to the standard order, adjectives describing age should come before adjectives describing purpose or qualifier. Therefore, the correct order should be \"old drinking monkey.\"\n\nLet's verify this with a simple code to check the order of adjectives:\n\n```python\ndef check_adjective_order(sentence):\n    adjectives = sentence.split()[:-1]  # Get all words except the last one (the noun)\n    order = [\"quantity\", \"quality\", \"size\", \"age\", \"shape\", \"color\", \"proper\", \"purpose\"]\n    adjective_types = {\"old\": \"age\", \"drinking\": \"purpose\"}\n    \n    indices = [order.index(adjective_types[adj]) for adj in adjectives if adj in adjective_types]\n    return indices == sorted(indices)\n\nsentence_A = \"drinking old monkey\"\nsentence_B = \"old drinking monkey\"\n\nresult_A = check_adjective_order(sentence_A)\nresult_B = check_adjective_order(sentence_B)\n\nprint(\"Sentence A is correct:\", result_A)\nprint(\"Sentence B is correct:\", result_B)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see which sentence has the correct adjective order.",
    "The code output confirms that Sentence B, \"old drinking monkey,\" follows the correct adjective order according to the standard rules of English grammar. The adjective \"old\" (age) comes before \"drinking\" (purpose), which aligns with the expected order.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is:\n\n<<<old drinking monkey>>>"
