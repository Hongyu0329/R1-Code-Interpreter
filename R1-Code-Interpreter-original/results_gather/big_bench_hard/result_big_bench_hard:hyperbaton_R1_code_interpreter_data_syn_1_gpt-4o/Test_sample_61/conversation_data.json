Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) cloth pink prismlike wonderful exercise large shoe\n- \"cloth\" is a material\n- \"pink\" is a color\n- \"prismlike\" is a shape\n- \"wonderful\" is a quality/opinion\n- \"exercise\" is a purpose\n- \"large\" is a size\n\n(B) wonderful large prismlike pink cloth exercise shoe\n- \"wonderful\" is a quality/opinion\n- \"large\" is a size\n- \"prismlike\" is a shape\n- \"pink\" is a color\n- \"cloth\" is a material\n- \"exercise\" is a purpose\n\nNow, let's compare the order of adjectives in both options with the typical order:\n\n- Option (A) does not follow the typical order.\n- Option (B) follows the typical order: quality/opinion, size, shape, color, material, purpose.\n\nTherefore, option (B) has the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<wonderful large prismlike pink cloth exercise shoe>>>"
