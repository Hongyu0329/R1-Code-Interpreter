    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) wonderful big circular orange Pakistani smoking car\n- Quality/opinion: wonderful\n- Size: big\n- Shape: circular\n- Color: orange\n- Proper adjective: Pakistani\n- Purpose/qualifier: smoking\n\n(B) circular wonderful smoking Pakistani big orange car\n- Shape: circular\n- Quality/opinion: wonderful\n- Purpose/qualifier: smoking\n- Proper adjective: Pakistani\n- Size: big\n- Color: orange\n\nNow, let's compare each option against the standard order:\n\n- Option (A) follows the order: Quality (wonderful), Size (big), Shape (circular), Color (orange), Proper adjective (Pakistani), Purpose (smoking).\n- Option (B) does not follow the standard order as it starts with Shape and mixes the order of adjectives.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct sentence with the proper adjective order.\n\n<<<A>>>"
