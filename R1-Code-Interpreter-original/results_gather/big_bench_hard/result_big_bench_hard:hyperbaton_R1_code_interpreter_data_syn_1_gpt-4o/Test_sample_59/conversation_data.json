    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) Iranian nice lead old-fashioned monkey\n- \"Iranian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion.\n- \"lead\" is a material.\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age descriptor.\n\n(B) nice old-fashioned Iranian lead monkey\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion.\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age descriptor.\n- \"Iranian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"lead\" is a material.\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: quality/opinion, age, proper adjective, material. \n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the order is correct:\n\n```python\ndef check_adjective_order(sentence):\n    order = [\"quality\", \"age\", \"proper\", \"material\"]\n    adjectives = {\n        \"nice\": \"quality\",\n        \"old-fashioned\": \"age\",\n        \"Iranian\": \"proper\",\n        \"lead\": \"material\"\n    }\n    words = sentence.split()\n    order_in_sentence = [adjectives[word] for word in words if word in adjectives]\n    return order_in_sentence == order\n\nsentence_A = \"Iranian nice lead old-fashioned monkey\"\nsentence_B = \"nice old-fashioned Iranian lead monkey\"\n\nresult_A = check_adjective_order(sentence_A)\nresult_B = check_adjective_order(sentence_B)\n\nprint(\"Sentence A correct order:\", result_A)\nprint(\"Sentence B correct order:\", result_B)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify which sentence follows the correct adjective order.",
    "The code output indicates that Sentence B follows the correct adjective order, while Sentence A does not. This aligns with our analysis based on the standard order of adjectives in English.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is:\n\n<<<nice old-fashioned Iranian lead monkey>>>"
