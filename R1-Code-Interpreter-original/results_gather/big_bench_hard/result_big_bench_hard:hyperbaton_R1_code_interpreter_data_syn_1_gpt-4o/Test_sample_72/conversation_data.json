    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to consider the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"driving\" and \"blue.\" \n\n- \"Blue\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Driving\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective, as it describes the type of car.\n\nAccording to the standard order, color adjectives should come before purpose or qualifier adjectives. Therefore, the correct order should be:\n\n1. Color: blue\n2. Purpose/Qualifier: driving\n\nThus, the correct sentence should be \"blue driving car.\"\n\nLet's verify this understanding with a simple Python script that checks the order of adjectives based on the standard rules.\n\n```python\ndef check_adjective_order(sentence):\n    adjectives = sentence.split()[:-1]  # Exclude the noun\n    order = [\"quantity\", \"quality\", \"size\", \"age\", \"shape\", \"color\", \"proper\", \"purpose\"]\n    adjective_types = {\"blue\": \"color\", \"driving\": \"purpose\"}\n    \n    indices = [order.index(adjective_types[adj]) for adj in adjectives if adj in adjective_types]\n    \n    return indices == sorted(indices)\n\n# Check both options\noption_a = \"driving blue car\"\noption_b = \"blue driving car\"\n\nresult_a = check_adjective_order(option_a)\nresult_b = check_adjective_order(option_b)\n\nprint(\"Option A is correct:\", result_a)\nprint(\"Option B is correct:\", result_b)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see which option is correct.",
    "The code output confirms that Option B, \"blue driving car,\" follows the correct adjective order according to the standard rules of English grammar. The adjective \"blue\" (color) should precede \"driving\" (purpose/qualifier).\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is:\n\n<<<(B) blue driving car>>>"
