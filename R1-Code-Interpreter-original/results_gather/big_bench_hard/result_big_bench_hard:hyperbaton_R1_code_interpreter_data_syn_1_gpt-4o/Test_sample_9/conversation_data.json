    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nGiven the options:\n\n(A) enormous rectangular blue dog\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"rectangular\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"blue\" is a color adjective.\n\n(B) enormous blue rectangular dog\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"blue\" is a color adjective.\n- \"rectangular\" is a shape adjective.\n\nAccording to the standard order, size should come before shape, and shape should come before color. Therefore, the correct order should be size, shape, color.\n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the logic is correct.\n\n```python\ndef check_adjective_order(option_a, option_b):\n    # Define the correct order of adjectives\n    correct_order = [\"size\", \"shape\", \"color\"]\n    \n    # Define the adjectives and their types for each option\n    adjectives_a = [(\"enormous\", \"size\"), (\"rectangular\", \"shape\"), (\"blue\", \"color\")]\n    adjectives_b = [(\"enormous\", \"size\"), (\"blue\", \"color\"), (\"rectangular\", \"shape\")]\n    \n    # Check the order of adjectives in each option\n    order_a = [adj_type for _, adj_type in adjectives_a]\n    order_b = [adj_type for _, adj_type in adjectives_b]\n    \n    # Compare with the correct order\n    is_a_correct = order_a == correct_order\n    is_b_correct = order_b == correct_order\n    \n    return is_a_correct, is_b_correct\n\n# Check which option is correct\noption_a_correct, option_b_correct = check_adjective_order(\n    \"enormous rectangular blue dog\", \n    \"enormous blue rectangular dog\"\n)\n\nprint(\"Option A is correct:\", option_a_correct)\nprint(\"Option B is correct:\", option_b_correct)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify which option is correct.",
    "Based on the code output, we can conclude that option (A) \"enormous rectangular blue dog\" follows the correct adjective order according to the standard rules of English grammar.\n\n<<<answer: A>>>"
