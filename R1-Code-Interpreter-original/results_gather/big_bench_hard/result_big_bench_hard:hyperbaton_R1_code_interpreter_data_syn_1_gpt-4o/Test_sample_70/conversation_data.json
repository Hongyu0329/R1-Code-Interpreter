Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nGiven the options:\n\n(A) Turkish square terrible chair\n- \"Turkish\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"Square\" is a shape.\n- \"Terrible\" is a quality or opinion.\n\n(B) Terrible square Turkish chair\n- \"Terrible\" is a quality or opinion.\n- \"Square\" is a shape.\n- \"Turkish\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nAccording to the adjective order rule, the correct sequence should be: quality/opinion, shape, proper adjective.
