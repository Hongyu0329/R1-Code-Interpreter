    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) ridiculous midsize old-fashioned pyramidal gray wool driving sock\n- ridiculous: opinion\n- midsize: size\n- old-fashioned: age\n- pyramidal: shape\n- gray: color\n- wool: material\n- driving: purpose\n\n(B) old-fashioned wool midsize pyramidal gray ridiculous driving sock\n- old-fashioned: age\n- wool: material\n- midsize: size\n- pyramidal: shape\n- gray: color\n- ridiculous: opinion\n- driving: purpose\n\nComparing both options to the standard order:\n- Option (A) follows the order: opinion, size, age, shape, color, material, purpose.\n- Option (B) does not follow the standard order, as it places age before material and opinion after color.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct sentence with the proper adjective order.\n\n<<<A>>>"
