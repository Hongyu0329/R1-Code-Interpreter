    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) snorkeling iron prismlike orange midsize knife\n- \"snorkeling\" (purpose)\n- \"iron\" (material)\n- \"prismlike\" (shape)\n- \"orange\" (color)\n- \"midsize\" (size)\n\n(B) midsize prismlike orange iron snorkeling knife\n- \"midsize\" (size)\n- \"prismlike\" (shape)\n- \"orange\" (color)\n- \"iron\" (material)\n- \"snorkeling\" (purpose)\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: size, shape, color, material, purpose. \n\nLet's verify this by checking the order of adjectives in both options using a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef check_adjective_order(option):\n    order = {\n        \"size\": [\"midsize\"],\n        \"shape\": [\"prismlike\"],\n        \"color\": [\"orange\"],\n        \"material\": [\"iron\"],\n        \"purpose\": [\"snorkeling\"]\n    }\n    \n    adjectives = option.split()\n    order_indices = []\n    \n    for adj in adjectives:\n        for category, words in order.items():\n            if adj in words:\n                order_indices.append(list(order.keys()).index(category))\n    \n    return order_indices == sorted(order_indices)\n\noption_a = \"snorkeling iron prismlike orange midsize knife\"\noption_b = \"midsize prismlike orange iron snorkeling knife\"\n\nresult_a = check_adjective_order(option_a)\nresult_b = check_adjective_order(option_b)\n\nprint(\"Option A is correct:\", result_a)\nprint(\"Option B is correct:\", result_b)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to determine which option follows the correct adjective order.",
    "The code output indicates that Option B follows the correct adjective order, while Option A does not. Based on the standard order of adjectives, Option B correctly arranges the adjectives as size, shape, color, material, and purpose.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is:\n\n<<<midsize prismlike orange iron snorkeling knife>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which sentence has the correct adjective order:\nOptions:\n(A) snorkeling iron prismlike orange midsize knife\n(B) midsize prismlike orange iron snorkeling knife\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
