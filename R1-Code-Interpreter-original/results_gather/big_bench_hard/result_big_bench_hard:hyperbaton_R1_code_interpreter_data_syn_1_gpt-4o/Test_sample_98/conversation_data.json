    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the general rule for the order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn this case, we have two adjectives: \"big\" and \"square.\" According to the order:\n\n- \"Big\" is a size adjective.\n- \"Square\" is a shape adjective.\n\nAccording to the order of adjectives, size comes before shape. Therefore, the correct order should be \"big square ship.\"\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple check using Python to ensure the order is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the adjectives and their categories\nadjectives = {\n    \"big\": \"size\",\n    \"square\": \"shape\"\n}\n\n# Define the correct order of adjectives\ncorrect_order = [\"size\", \"shape\"]\n\n# Check the order of the given options\noption_A = [\"big\", \"square\"]\noption_B = [\"square\", \"big\"]\n\n# Function to check if the order is correct\ndef check_order(option, adjectives, correct_order):\n    order = [adjectives[adj] for adj in option]\n    return order == correct_order\n\n# Check both options\nresult_A = check_order(option_A, adjectives, correct_order)\nresult_B = check_order(option_B, adjectives, correct_order)\n\nprint(\"Option A is correct:\", result_A)\nprint(\"Option B is correct:\", result_B)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the results.",
    "The code output confirms that Option A, \"big square ship,\" follows the correct order of adjectives according to the standard rules of English grammar. Option B, \"square big ship,\" does not follow the correct order.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is:\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which sentence has the correct adjective order:\nOptions:\n(A) big square ship\n(B) square big ship\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
