    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to consider the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"American\" and \"triangular.\" \n\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective, indicating nationality or origin.\n- \"Triangular\" describes the shape.\n\nAccording to the standard order, shape adjectives should come before proper adjectives. Therefore, the correct order should be:\n\n1. Shape: Triangular\n2. Proper adjective: American\n\nThus, the correct sentence is \"triangular American computer.\"\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the order programmatically:\n\n```python\n# Define the adjectives and their categories\nadjectives = {\n    \"American\": \"proper\",\n    \"triangular\": \"shape\"\n}\n\n# Define the standard order of adjectives\norder = [\"quantity\", \"quality\", \"size\", \"age\", \"shape\", \"color\", \"proper\", \"purpose\"]\n\n# Function to determine the order of adjectives\ndef check_adjective_order(adj1, adj2):\n    index1 = order.index(adjectives[adj1])\n    index2 = order.index(adjectives[adj2])\n    return index1 < index2\n\n# Check the order for the given options\noption_A = check_adjective_order(\"American\", \"triangular\")\noption_B = check_adjective_order(\"triangular\", \"American\")\n\nprint(\"Option A is correct:\", option_A)\nprint(\"Option B is correct:\", option_B)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm which option follows the correct adjective order.",
    "The code execution confirms that Option B, \"triangular American computer,\" follows the correct adjective order according to the standard rules of English grammar. The shape adjective \"triangular\" should precede the proper adjective \"American.\"\n\n<<<triangular American computer>>>"
