    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) terrible tiny new square Egyptian typing sock\n- Quality/opinion: terrible\n- Size: tiny\n- Age: new\n- Shape: square\n- Proper adjective: Egyptian\n- Purpose/qualifier: typing\n\n(B) new typing square Egyptian tiny terrible sock\n- Age: new\n- Purpose/qualifier: typing\n- Shape: square\n- Proper adjective: Egyptian\n- Size: tiny\n- Quality/opinion: terrible\n\nNow, let's compare these with the standard order:\n\n- Option (A) follows the order: Quality (terrible), Size (tiny), Age (new), Shape (square), Proper adjective (Egyptian), Purpose (typing).\n- Option (B) does not follow the standard order as it starts with Age and mixes Purpose and Quality incorrectly.\n\nTherefore, option (A) follows the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which sentence has the correct adjective order:\nOptions:\n(A) terrible tiny new square Egyptian typing sock\n(B) new typing square Egyptian tiny terrible sock\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
