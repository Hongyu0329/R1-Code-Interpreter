    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) enormous pyramidal white Indonesian glass smoking cat\n- enormous: size\n- pyramidal: shape\n- white: color\n- Indonesian: proper adjective (nationality)\n- glass: material\n- smoking: purpose\n\n(B) pyramidal Indonesian enormous smoking white glass cat\n- pyramidal: shape\n- Indonesian: proper adjective (nationality)\n- enormous: size\n- smoking: purpose\n- white: color\n- glass: material\n\nNow, let's apply the standard order to see which option fits better:\n\n1. Size: enormous\n2. Shape: pyramidal\n3. Color: white\n4. Proper adjective: Indonesian\n5. Material: glass\n6. Purpose: smoking\n\nOption (A) follows the correct order: size, shape, color, proper adjective, material, purpose.\n\nOption (B) does not follow the correct order, as it starts with shape and places size after the proper adjective.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
