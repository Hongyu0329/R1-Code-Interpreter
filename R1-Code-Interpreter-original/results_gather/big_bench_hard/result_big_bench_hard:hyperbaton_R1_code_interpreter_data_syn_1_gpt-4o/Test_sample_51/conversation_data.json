    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to consider the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Origin\n8. Material\n9. Purpose\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"green\" and \"wool.\" According to the order of adjectives, \"green\" is a color, and \"wool\" is a material. Therefore, the correct order should be color followed by material.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n- Option (A) \"green wool sweater\": This follows the correct order of color (green) followed by material (wool).\n- Option (B) \"wool green sweater\": This does not follow the correct order, as material (wool) comes before color (green).\n\nBased on the standard order of adjectives, option (A) is the correct sentence.\n\n<<<green wool sweater>>>"
