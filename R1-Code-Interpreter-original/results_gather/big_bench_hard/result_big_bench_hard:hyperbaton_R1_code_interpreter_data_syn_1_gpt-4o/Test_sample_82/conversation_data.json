    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical order of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) lovely ancient triangular orange Turkish wood smoking shoe\n- lovely: quality/opinion\n- ancient: age\n- triangular: shape\n- orange: color\n- Turkish: proper adjective (nationality)\n- wood: material\n- smoking: purpose/qualifier\n\n(B) Turkish wood smoking lovely orange ancient triangular shoe\n- Turkish: proper adjective (nationality)\n- wood: material\n- smoking: purpose/qualifier\n- lovely: quality/opinion\n- orange: color\n- ancient: age\n- triangular: shape\n\nComparing both options with the typical order of adjectives, option (A) follows the correct order more closely than option (B). In option (A), the adjectives are in the order of quality, age, shape, color, nationality, material, and purpose, which aligns with the standard order.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
