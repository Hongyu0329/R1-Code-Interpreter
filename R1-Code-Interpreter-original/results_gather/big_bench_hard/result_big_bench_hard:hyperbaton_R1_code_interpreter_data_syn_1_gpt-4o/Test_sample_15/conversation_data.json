    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) enormous yellow Egyptian driving computer\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"yellow\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Egyptian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"driving\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\n(B) driving yellow enormous Egyptian computer\n- \"driving\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"yellow\" is a color adjective.\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"Egyptian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: size, color, proper adjective, purpose. Therefore, option (A) follows the correct order: \"enormous\" (size), \"yellow\" (color), \"Egyptian\" (proper adjective), \"driving\" (purpose).\n\nThus, the correct sentence is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
