    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) enormous new triangular Nigerian lead cat\n- enormous: size\n- new: age\n- triangular: shape\n- Nigerian: proper adjective (nationality)\n- lead: material\n\n(B) enormous Nigerian triangular new lead cat\n- enormous: size\n- Nigerian: proper adjective (nationality)\n- triangular: shape\n- new: age\n- lead: material\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: size, age, shape, proper adjective, material. \n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to check the order:\n\n```python\ndef check_adjective_order(sentence):\n    order = [\"size\", \"age\", \"shape\", \"proper adjective\", \"material\"]\n    adjectives = {\n        \"enormous\": \"size\",\n        \"new\": \"age\",\n        \"triangular\": \"shape\",\n        \"Nigerian\": \"proper adjective\",\n        \"lead\": \"material\"\n    }\n    \n    words = sentence.split()\n    adjective_order = [adjectives[word] for word in words if word in adjectives]\n    \n    return adjective_order == order\n\nsentence_A = \"enormous new triangular Nigerian lead cat\"\nsentence_B = \"enormous Nigerian triangular new lead cat\"\n\nresult_A = check_adjective_order(sentence_A)\nresult_B = check_adjective_order(sentence_B)\n\nprint(\"Sentence A correct order:\", result_A)\nprint(\"Sentence B correct order:\", result_B)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to see which sentence follows the correct adjective order.",
    "Based on the code output, Sentence A follows the correct adjective order, while Sentence B does not. The correct order of adjectives should be size, age, shape, proper adjective, and material, which is satisfied by Sentence A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which sentence has the correct adjective order:\nOptions:\n(A) enormous new triangular Nigerian lead cat\n(B) enormous Nigerian triangular new lead cat\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
