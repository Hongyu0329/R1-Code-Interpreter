Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) silver new repulsive exercise green Pakistani computer\n- silver (color)\n- new (age)\n- repulsive (opinion)\n- exercise (purpose)\n- green (color)\n- Pakistani (proper adjective)\n- computer (noun)\n\n(B) repulsive new green Pakistani silver exercise computer\n- repulsive (opinion)\n- new (age)\n- green (color)\n- Pakistani (proper adjective)\n- silver (color)\n- exercise (purpose)\n- computer (noun)\n\nNow, let's apply the standard order to see which option fits best:\n\n1.
