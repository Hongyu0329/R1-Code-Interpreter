    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) rubber gray walking Mexican midsize cat\n- rubber (material)\n- gray (color)\n- walking (purpose/qualifier)\n- Mexican (proper adjective)\n- midsize (size)\n\n(B) midsize gray Mexican rubber walking cat\n- midsize (size)\n- gray (color)\n- Mexican (proper adjective)\n- rubber (material)\n- walking (purpose/qualifier)\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: size, color, proper adjective, material, and purpose/qualifier. \n\nLet's check which option follows this order:\n\n- Option (A) does not follow the correct order.\n- Option (B) follows the correct order: midsize (size), gray (color), Mexican (proper adjective), rubber (material), walking (purpose/qualifier).\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct sentence with the proper adjective order.\n\n<<<B>>>"
