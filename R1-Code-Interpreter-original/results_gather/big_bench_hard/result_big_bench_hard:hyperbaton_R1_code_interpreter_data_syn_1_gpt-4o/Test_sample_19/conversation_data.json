Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) repulsive big rectangular pink steel exercise shoe\n- Quality or opinion: repulsive\n- Size: big\n- Shape: rectangular\n- Color: pink\n- Material: steel\n- Purpose: exercise\n\n(B) pink big exercise repulsive steel rectangular shoe\n- Color: pink\n- Size: big\n- Purpose: exercise\n- Quality or opinion: repulsive\n- Material: steel\n- Shape: rectangular\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: Quality, Size, Shape, Color, Material, Purpose. \n\nLet's check which option follows this order:\n\n- Option (A) follows the order: Quality (repulsive), Size (big), Shape (rectangular), Color (pink), Material (steel), Purpose (exercise).\n- Option (B) does not follow the correct order.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct sentence with the proper adjective order.\n\n<<<A>>>"
