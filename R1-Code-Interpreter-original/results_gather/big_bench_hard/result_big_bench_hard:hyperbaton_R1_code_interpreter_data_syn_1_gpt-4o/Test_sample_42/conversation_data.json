Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nGiven the options:\n\n(A) Russian steel awful chair\n(B) awful Russian steel chair\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- In option (A), the order is: Proper adjective (Russian), Material (steel), Opinion (awful), Noun (chair).\n- In option (B), the order is: Opinion (awful), Proper adjective (Russian), Material (steel), Noun (chair).\n\nAccording to the adjective order rule, the opinion should come before the proper adjective and material. Therefore, option (B) follows the correct order.\n\nThus, the correct sentence is:\n\n(B) awful Russian steel chair\n\n<<<awful Russian steel chair>>>"
