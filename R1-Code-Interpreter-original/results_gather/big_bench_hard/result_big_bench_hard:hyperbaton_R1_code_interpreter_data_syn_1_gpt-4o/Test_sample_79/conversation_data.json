    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) midsize purple Russian gold snorkeling sock\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"purple\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Russian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"gold\" is a material adjective.\n- \"snorkeling\" is a purpose adjective.\n\n(B) gold Russian midsize purple snorkeling sock\n- \"gold\" is a material adjective.\n- \"Russian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"purple\" is a color adjective.\n- \"snorkeling\" is a purpose adjective.\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: size, color, proper adjective, material, and purpose. Let's check which option follows this order:\n\n- Option (A) follows the order: size (midsize), color (purple), proper adjective (Russian), material (gold), purpose (snorkeling).\n- Option (B) does not follow the correct order.\n\nTherefore, option (A) has the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<A>>>"
