    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nGiven the options:\n\n(A) nice enormous blue Bangladeshi dog\n(B) Bangladeshi nice blue enormous dog\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- Option (A): \n  - \"nice\" is a quality/opinion adjective.\n  - \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n  - \"blue\" is a color adjective.\n  - \"Bangladeshi\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\n- Option (B):\n  - \"Bangladeshi\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n  - \"nice\" is a quality/opinion adjective.\n  - \"blue\" is a color adjective.\n  - \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n\nAccording to the typical adjective order, the correct sequence should be: quality/opinion, size, color, proper adjective.
