    "\nassistant > To determine when Anthony could have gone to the orchestra hall, we need to identify any gaps in his schedule where he was not seen by anyone else and the orchestra hall was open.\n\nLet's review Anthony's schedule:\n\n- 6am to 12pm: At the yoga studio\n- 12pm to 2pm: Driving to the water park\n- 2pm to 3pm: Watching a movie at the theater\n- 5pm to 6pm: Fixing a computer at the electronic store\n- 6pm to 7pm: Reading at the library\n\nThe orchestra hall was closed after 7pm, so Anthony could only have gone there before 7pm.\n\nThe only gap in Anthony's schedule where he was not seen by anyone and the orchestra hall was open is between 3pm and 5pm.\n\nTherefore, the time when Anthony could have gone to the orchestra hall is:\n\n<<<C) 3pm to 5pm>>>"
