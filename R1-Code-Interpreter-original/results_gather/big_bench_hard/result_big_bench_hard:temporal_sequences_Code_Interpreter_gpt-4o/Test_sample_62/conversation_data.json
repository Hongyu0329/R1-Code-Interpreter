    "\nassistant > To determine when Andrew could have gone to the dance studio, we need to consider the times when Andrew was seen at other locations:\n\n1. Andrew was playing tennis from 8am to 11am.\n2. Andrew was reading at the library from 11am to 1pm.\n3. Andrew was fixing their computer at the electronic store from 8pm to 10pm.\n\nThe dance studio was closed after 10pm, so Andrew could not have gone there after 10pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- (A) 8pm to 10pm: Andrew was at the electronic store during this time.\n- (B) 11am to 1pm: Andrew was at the library during this time.\n- (C) 8am to 11am: Andrew was playing tennis during this time.\n- (D) 1pm to 8pm: This is the only time period not accounted for by the other activities.\n\nTherefore, the only time Andrew could have gone to the dance studio is between 1pm and 8pm.\n\nThe answer is: <<<D>>>"
