Let's analyze the timeline:\n\n- David woke up at 8am.\n- Elizabeth saw David at the airport from 10am to 1pm.\n- David was seen playing tennis from 1pm to 2pm.\n- Jessica saw David at the gym from 2pm to 3pm.\n- Susan saw David at the train station from 3pm to 4pm.\n- Sean saw David on a rooftop from 4pm to 6pm.\n- The coffee shop was closed after 6pm.\n\nThe only time slot where David was not accounted for is between 8am and 10am. Therefore, the time David could have gone to the coffee shop is:\n\n<<<C) 8am to 10am>>>"
