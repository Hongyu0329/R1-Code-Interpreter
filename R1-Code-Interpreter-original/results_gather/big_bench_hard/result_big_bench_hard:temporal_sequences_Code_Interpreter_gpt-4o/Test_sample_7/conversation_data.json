Let's review the timeline:\n\n- 6am: Sarah woke up.\n- 8am to 2pm: Sarah was at the electronic store.\n- 2pm to 3pm: Sarah was driving to the water park.\n- 3pm to 4pm: Sarah was at the mall.\n- 4pm to 6pm: Sarah was at the bakery.\n- 6pm to 8pm: Sarah was at the school.\n- After 8pm: The construction site was closed.\n\nThe only time Sarah was not accounted for is between 6am and 8am. Therefore, the time Sarah could have gone to the construction site is:\n\n<<<C) 6am to 8am>>>"
