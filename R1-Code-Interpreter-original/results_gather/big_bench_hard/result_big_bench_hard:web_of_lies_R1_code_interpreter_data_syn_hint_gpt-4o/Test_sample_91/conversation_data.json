    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Antwan tells the truth.**  \n   - This is a given statement. Let's assume it is true.\n\n2. **Helene says Antwan tells the truth.**  \n   - If Helene is telling the truth, then Antwan is indeed telling the truth, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\n3. **Gwenn says Helene tells the truth.**  \n   - If Gwenn is telling the truth, then Helene is telling the truth, which means Antwan is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Sal says Gwenn tells the truth.**  \n   - If Sal is telling the truth, then Gwenn is telling the truth, which means Helene is telling the truth, and thus Antwan is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Shaunda says Sal lies.**  \n   - If Shaunda is telling the truth, then Sal is lying. If Sal is lying, then Gwenn is not telling the truth, which means Helene is not telling the truth, and thus Antwan is not telling the truth. This contradicts our initial assumption that Antwan tells the truth.\n\nSince assuming Shaunda tells the truth leads to a contradiction, Shaunda must be lying.\n\nTherefore, Shaunda does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
