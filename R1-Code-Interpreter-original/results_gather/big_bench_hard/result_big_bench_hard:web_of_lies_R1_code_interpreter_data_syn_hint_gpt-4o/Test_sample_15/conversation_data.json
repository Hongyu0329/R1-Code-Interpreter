    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical consistency of their statements.\n\n1. **Willian lies.**\n2. **Inga says Willian tells the truth.**\n3. **Fidel says Inga lies.**\n4. **Gwenn says Fidel tells the truth.**\n5. **Crista says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Willian lies, then Inga's statement that Willian tells the truth is false. Therefore, Inga lies.\n- If Inga lies, then Fidel's statement that Inga lies is true. Therefore, Fidel tells the truth.\n- If Fidel tells the truth, then Gwenn's statement that Fidel tells the truth is true. Therefore, Gwenn tells the truth.\n- If Gwenn tells the truth, then Crista's statement that Gwenn tells the truth is true. Therefore, Crista tells the truth.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Crista tells the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
