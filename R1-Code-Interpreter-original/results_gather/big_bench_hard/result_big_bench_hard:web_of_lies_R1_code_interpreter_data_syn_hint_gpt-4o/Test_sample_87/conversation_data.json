    "To determine whether Leda tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements and the relationships between them. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Teressa lies.\n2. Kristian says Teressa lies.\n3. Sal says Kristian tells the truth.\n4. Audrie says Sal lies.\n5. Leda says Audrie lies.\n\nWe need to determine the truthfulness of each statement:\n\n- If Teressa lies, then Kristian's statement \"Teressa lies\" is true.\n- If Kristian tells the truth, then Sal's statement \"Kristian tells the truth\" is true.\n- If Sal tells the truth, then Audrie's statement \"Sal lies\" is false, meaning Audrie lies.\n- If Audrie lies, then Leda's statement \"Audrie lies\" is true, meaning Leda tells the truth.\n\nLet's verify this logic:\n\n1. Assume Teressa lies. Then Kristian's statement is true.\n2. If Kristian's statement is true, then Sal's statement is true.\n3. If Sal's statement is true, then Audrie's statement is false, meaning Audrie lies.\n4. If Audrie lies, then Leda's statement is true.\n\nThus, Leda tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Leda tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
