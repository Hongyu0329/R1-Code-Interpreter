    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - If Kandi tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Crista says Kandi lies.**\n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Kandi is lying, which contradicts Kandi's statement of telling the truth. Therefore, Crista must be lying.\n\n3. **Ryan says Crista tells the truth.**\n   - Since Crista is lying, Ryan's statement that Crista tells the truth must also be a lie.\n\n4. **Gwenn says Ryan tells the truth.**\n   - Since Ryan is lying, Gwenn's statement that Ryan tells the truth must also be a lie.\n\n5. **Delfina says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n   - Since Gwenn is lying, Delfina's statement that Gwenn tells the truth must also be a lie.\n\nTherefore, Delfina does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>No, Delfina does not tell the truth."
