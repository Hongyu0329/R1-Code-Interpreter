    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency.\n\n1. **Delfina tells the truth.**\n   - This is our starting point. If Delfina tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Willian says Delfina tells the truth.**\n   - If Willian is telling the truth, then his statement is consistent with Delfina telling the truth.\n\n3. **Crista says Willian lies.**\n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Willian must be lying. However, if Willian is lying, then Delfina does not tell the truth, which contradicts our starting point.\n\n4. **Shalonda says Crista lies.**\n   - If Shalonda is telling the truth, then Crista is lying. If Crista is lying, then Willian is telling the truth, which is consistent with Delfina telling the truth.\n\n5. **Shenna says Shalonda tells the truth.**\n   - If Shenna is telling the truth, then Shalonda is telling the truth, which means Crista is lying, and Willian is telling the truth, which is consistent with Delfina telling the truth.\n\nBased on this analysis, if Shenna is telling the truth, then all statements are consistent with Delfina telling the truth. Therefore, Shenna must be telling the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
