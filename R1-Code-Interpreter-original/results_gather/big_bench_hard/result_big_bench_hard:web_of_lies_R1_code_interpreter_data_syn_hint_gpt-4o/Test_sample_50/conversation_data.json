    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - If Rashida is telling the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Willian says Rashida lies.**\n   - If Willian is telling the truth, then Rashida is lying, which contradicts our assumption that Rashida tells the truth. Therefore, Willian must be lying.\n\n3. **Christie says Willian lies.**\n   - Since we have determined that Willian is lying, Christie's statement is true. Therefore, Christie tells the truth.\n\n4. **Ryan says Christie lies.**\n   - Since Christie tells the truth, Ryan's statement is false. Therefore, Ryan is lying.\n\n5. **Shaunda says Ryan lies.**\n   - Since Ryan is lying, Shaunda's statement is true. Therefore, Shaunda tells the truth.\n\nBased on this analysis, Shaunda is telling the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes, Shaunda tells the truth."
