    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n2. **Michaela says Sima lies.**\n3. **Leda says Michaela tells the truth.**\n4. **Fletcher says Leda lies.**\n5. **Vina says Fletcher tells the truth.**\n\nLet's start by assuming Sima tells the truth:\n\n- If Sima tells the truth, then Michaela's statement that Sima lies is false.\n- If Michaela's statement is false, then Leda's statement that Michaela tells the truth is also false.\n- If Leda's statement is false, then Fletcher's statement that Leda lies is true.\n- If Fletcher's statement is true, then Vina's statement that Fletcher tells the truth is also true.\n\nNow, let's assume Sima lies:\n\n- If Sima lies, then Michaela's statement that Sima lies is true.\n- If Michaela's statement is true, then Leda's statement that Michaela tells the truth is true.\n- If Leda's statement is true, then Fletcher's statement that Leda lies is false.\n- If Fletcher's statement is false, then Vina's statement that Fletcher tells the truth is false.\n\nIn both scenarios, we find that Vina's statement is consistent with the assumption that Sima tells the truth. Therefore, Vina tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>Vina tells the truth."
