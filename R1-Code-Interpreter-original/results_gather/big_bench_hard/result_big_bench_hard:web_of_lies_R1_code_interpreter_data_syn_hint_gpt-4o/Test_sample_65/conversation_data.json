    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical implications of their statements.\n\n1. **Jim lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Jim lies, then any statement he makes is false.\n\n2. **Ka says Jim lies.**\n   - If Ka is telling the truth, then Jim indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. If Ka is lying, then Jim does not lie, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, Ka must be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Jerry says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have determined that Ka tells the truth, Jerry's statement is true. Therefore, Jerry tells the truth.\n\n4. **Fletcher says Jerry tells the truth.**\n   - Since Jerry tells the truth, Fletcher's statement is also true. Therefore, Fletcher tells the truth.\n\n5. **Kandi says Fletcher lies.**\n   - Since Fletcher tells the truth, Kandi's statement is false. Therefore, Kandi lies.\n\nBased on this analysis, Kandi does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>No, Kandi does not tell the truth."
