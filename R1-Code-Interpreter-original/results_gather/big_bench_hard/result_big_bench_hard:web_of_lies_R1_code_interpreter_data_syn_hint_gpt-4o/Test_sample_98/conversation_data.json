    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Millicent tells the truth.**\n   - This is our starting point. If Millicent tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Alexis says Millicent lies.**\n   - If Millicent tells the truth, then Alexis's statement must be false because Alexis claims that Millicent lies.\n\n3. **Jaymie says Alexis lies.**\n   - Since Alexis's statement is false (because Millicent tells the truth), Jaymie's statement is true. Jaymie correctly identifies that Alexis lies.\n\n4. **Willian says Jaymie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Jaymie's statement is true, Willian's statement is also true because he correctly states that Jaymie tells the truth.\n\n5. **Leda says Willian lies.**\n   - Since Willian's statement is true, Leda's statement must be false because she claims that Willian lies.\n\nTherefore, Leda does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
