    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Conception tells the truth.**\n   - If Conception is telling the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Teressa says Conception lies.**\n   - If Teressa is telling the truth, then Conception is lying. This contradicts the assumption that Conception tells the truth. Therefore, Teressa must be lying.\n\n3. **Sal says Teressa tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have determined that Teressa is lying, Sal's statement that Teressa tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Sal is also lying.\n\n4. **Fidel says Sal tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sal is lying, Fidel's statement that Sal tells the truth is false. Therefore, Fidel is lying.\n\n5. **Shenna says Fidel lies.**\n   - Since Fidel is indeed lying, Shenna's statement that Fidel lies is true.\n\nTherefore, Shenna is telling the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>Shenna tells the truth.<<<answer>>>"
