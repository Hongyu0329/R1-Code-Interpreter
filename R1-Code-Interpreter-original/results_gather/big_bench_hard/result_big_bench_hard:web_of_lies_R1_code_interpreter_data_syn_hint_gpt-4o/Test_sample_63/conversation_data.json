    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine if Dallas tells the truth. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Jerry tells the truth.\n2. Elanor says Jerry tells the truth.\n3. Gwenn says Elanor tells the truth.\n4. Kandi says Gwenn tells the truth.\n5. Dallas says Kandi tells the truth.\n\nWe start by assuming Jerry tells the truth. If Jerry tells the truth, then Elanor's statement is true because she says Jerry tells the truth. If Elanor's statement is true, then Gwenn's statement is also true because she says Elanor tells the truth. If Gwenn's statement is true, then Kandi's statement is true because she says Gwenn tells the truth. Finally, if Kandi's statement is true, then Dallas's statement is true because he says Kandi tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, if Jerry tells the truth, then all subsequent statements are true, including Dallas's statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Jerry does not tell the truth. If Jerry does not tell the truth, then Elanor's statement is false because she says Jerry tells the truth. If Elanor's statement is false, then Gwenn's statement is false because she says Elanor tells the truth. If Gwenn's statement is false, then Kandi's statement is false because she says Gwenn tells the truth. Finally, if Kandi's statement is false, then Dallas's statement is false because he says Kandi tells the truth.\n\nThus, if Jerry does not tell the truth, then all subsequent statements are false, including Dallas's statement.\n\nIn both scenarios, the truthfulness of Dallas's statement is directly linked to Jerry's truthfulness. Since the problem states that Jerry tells the truth, we conclude that Dallas also tells the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
