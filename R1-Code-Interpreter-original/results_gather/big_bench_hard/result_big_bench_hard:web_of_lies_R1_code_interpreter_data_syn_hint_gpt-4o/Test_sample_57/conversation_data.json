    "To determine if Shalonda tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements and the relationships between them.\n\n1. **Jerry lies.**\n   - This is a given statement.\n\n2. **Helene says Jerry lies.**\n   - If Helene tells the truth, then Jerry indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement.\n\n3. **Kandi says Helene tells the truth.**\n   - If Kandi tells the truth, then Helene tells the truth, which means Jerry lies. This is consistent with the given statement.\n\n4. **Jaymie says Kandi lies.**\n   - If Jaymie tells the truth, then Kandi lies, which means Helene does not tell the truth. This would imply that Jerry does not lie, which contradicts the given statement.\n\n5. **Shalonda says Jaymie lies.**\n   - If Shalonda tells the truth, then Jaymie lies, which means Kandi tells the truth, and Helene tells the truth, which means Jerry lies.
