    "To determine if Amberly tells the truth, we need to analyze the chain of statements and see if they are consistent.\n\n1. **Tamika tells the truth.**\n   - This is our starting point. We assume Tamika tells the truth.\n\n2. **Ka says Tamika tells the truth.**\n   - If Tamika tells the truth, then Ka is also telling the truth because Ka's statement is consistent with Tamika's truthfulness.\n\n3. **Fidel says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - Since Ka tells the truth (as established in step 2), Fidel is also telling the truth because his statement is consistent with Ka's truthfulness.\n\n4. **Elanor says Fidel tells the truth.**\n   - Since Fidel tells the truth (as established in step 3), Elanor is also telling the truth because her statement is consistent with Fidel's truthfulness.\n\n5. **Amberly says Elanor tells the truth.**\n   - Since Elanor tells the truth (as established in step 4), Amberly is also telling the truth because her statement is consistent with Elanor's truthfulness.\n\nSince each statement in the chain is consistent with the previous one, and we started with the assumption that Tamika tells the truth, we can conclude that Amberly also tells the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
