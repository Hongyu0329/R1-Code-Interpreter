    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Raymond tells the truth.**\n   - If Raymond tells the truth, then his statement is true.\n\n2. **Sal says Raymond lies.**\n   - If Sal is telling the truth, then Raymond is lying, which contradicts our assumption that Raymond tells the truth. Therefore, Sal must be lying.\n\n3. **Alexis says Sal lies.**\n   - Since Sal is lying, Alexis is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Helene says Alexis lies.**\n   - Since Alexis is telling the truth, Helene must be lying.\n\n5. **Elanor says Helene lies.**\n   - Since Helene is lying, Elanor is telling the truth.\n\nBased on this analysis, Elanor is indeed telling the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
