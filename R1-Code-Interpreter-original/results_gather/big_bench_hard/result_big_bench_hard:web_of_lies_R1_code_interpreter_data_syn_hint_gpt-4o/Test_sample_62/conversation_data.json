    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Delfina lies.**\n   - This is a statement about Delfina. We don't have any other information about Delfina, so we assume this statement is true for now.\n\n2. **Leda says Delfina lies.**\n   - If Leda is telling the truth, then Delfina indeed lies, which is consistent with the first statement. So, Leda could be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Fidel says Leda lies.**\n   - If Fidel is telling the truth, then Leda is lying. But if Leda is lying, then Delfina does not lie, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, Fidel must be lying.\n\n4. **Sal says Fidel tells the truth.**\n   - Since we determined that Fidel is lying, Sal must be lying as well because he claims Fidel tells the truth.\n\n5. **Andree says Sal lies.**\n   - Since Sal is indeed lying, Andree is telling the truth.\n\nBased on this analysis, Andree tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes, Andree tells the truth."
