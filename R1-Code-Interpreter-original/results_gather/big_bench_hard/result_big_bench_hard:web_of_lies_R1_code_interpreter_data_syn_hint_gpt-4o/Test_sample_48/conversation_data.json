    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement based on the given information. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Audrie tells the truth.**\n2. **Yoland says Audrie lies.**\n3. **Shaunda says Yoland tells the truth.**\n4. **Raymond says Shaunda lies.**\n5. **Maybelle says Raymond lies.**\n\nLet's start by assuming Audrie tells the truth:\n\n- If Audrie tells the truth, then Yoland's statement that \"Audrie lies\" is false. Therefore, Yoland is lying.\n- If Yoland is lying, then Shaunda's statement that \"Yoland tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Shaunda is lying.\n- If Shaunda is lying, then Raymond's statement that \"Shaunda lies\" is true. Therefore, Raymond is telling the truth.\n- If Raymond is telling the truth, then Maybelle's statement that \"Raymond lies\" is false. Therefore, Maybelle is lying.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite scenario where Audrie is lying:\n\n- If Audrie is lying, then Yoland's statement that \"Audrie lies\" is true. Therefore, Yoland is telling the truth.\n- If Yoland is telling the truth, then Shaunda's statement that \"Yoland tells the truth\" is true. Therefore, Shaunda is telling the truth.\n- If Shaunda is telling the truth, then Raymond's statement that \"Shaunda lies\" is false. Therefore, Raymond is lying.\n- If Raymond is lying, then Maybelle's statement that \"Raymond lies\" is true. Therefore, Maybelle is telling the truth.\n\nIn both scenarios, we have a consistent set of truth-tellers and liars. However, the question asks if Maybelle tells the truth. In the scenario where Audrie is lying, Maybelle tells the truth. Therefore, it is possible for Maybelle to be telling the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
