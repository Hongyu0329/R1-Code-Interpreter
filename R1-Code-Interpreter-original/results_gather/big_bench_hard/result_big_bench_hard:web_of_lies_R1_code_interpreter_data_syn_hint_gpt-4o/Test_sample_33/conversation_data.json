    "To determine if Michael tells the truth, we need to analyze the chain of statements and their implications:\n\n1. **Jerry lies.**  \n   - This is a given statement. If Jerry lies, then any statement he makes is false.\n\n2. **Helene says Jerry lies.**  \n   - If Helene is telling the truth, then Jerry indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. If Helene is lying, then Jerry does not lie, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, Helene must be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Alexis says Helene tells the truth.**  \n   - Since we have established that Helene tells the truth, Alexis is also telling the truth.\n\n4. **Sherrie says Alexis tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Alexis tells the truth, Sherrie is also telling the truth.\n\n5. **Michael says Sherrie tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Sherrie tells the truth, Michael is also telling the truth.\n\nBased on this chain of reasoning, Michael tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
