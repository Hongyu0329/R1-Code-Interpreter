    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - If Kandi is telling the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Michaela says Kandi lies.**\n   - If Michaela is telling the truth, then Kandi is lying. But this contradicts Kandi's statement that she tells the truth. Therefore, Michaela must be lying.\n\n3. **Vernell says Michaela lies.**\n   - Since Michaela is lying (as determined in step 2), Vernell's statement is true. Therefore, Vernell is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Antwan says Vernell tells the truth.**\n   - Since Vernell is telling the truth (as determined in step 3), Antwan's statement is true. Therefore, Antwan is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Sal says Antwan lies.**\n   - Since Antwan is telling the truth (as determined in step 4), Sal's statement is false. Therefore, Sal is lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, Sal does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>No, Sal does not tell the truth."
