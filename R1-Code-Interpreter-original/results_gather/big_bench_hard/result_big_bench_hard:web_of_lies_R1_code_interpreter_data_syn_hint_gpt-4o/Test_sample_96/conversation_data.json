    "To determine if Phoebe tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications.\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n2. **Teressa says Sima tells the truth.**  \n   - If Teressa is telling the truth, then Sima is indeed telling the truth.\n3. **Vina says Teressa lies.**  \n   - If Vina is telling the truth, then Teressa is lying, which means Sima is not telling the truth.\n4. **Crista says Vina lies.**  \n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Vina is lying, which means Teressa is telling the truth, and thus Sima is telling the truth.\n5. **Phoebe says Crista tells the truth.**  \n   - If Phoebe is telling the truth, then Crista is telling the truth, which means Vina is lying, Teressa is telling the truth, and Sima is telling the truth.\n\nLet's analyze the logical consistency:\n\n- If Sima tells the truth, then Teressa is telling the truth, which means Vina is lying, Crista is telling the truth, and Phoebe is telling the truth.\n- If Sima is lying, then Teressa is lying, which means Vina is telling the truth, Crista is lying, and Phoebe is lying.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is when Sima tells the truth, which leads to all statements being consistent with each other. Therefore, Phoebe is telling the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
