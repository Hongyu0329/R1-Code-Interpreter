    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Ryan lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Ryan always lies.\n\n2. **Kandi says Ryan lies.**\n   - If Kandi is telling the truth, then Ryan indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. Therefore, Kandi is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Lorine says Kandi lies.**\n   - Since we determined that Kandi tells the truth, Lorine's statement that Kandi lies must be false. Therefore, Lorine is lying.\n\n4. **Christie says Lorine tells the truth.**\n   - Since Lorine is lying, Christie's statement that Lorine tells the truth is false. Therefore, Christie is lying.\n\n5. **Fletcher says Christie lies.**\n   - Since Christie is lying, Fletcher's statement that Christie lies is true. Therefore, Fletcher is telling the truth.\n\nBased on this analysis, Fletcher tells the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
