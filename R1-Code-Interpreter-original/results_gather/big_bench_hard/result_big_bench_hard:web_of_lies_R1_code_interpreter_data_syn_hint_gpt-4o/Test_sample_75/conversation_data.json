    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Leda tells the truth.**\n2. **Shalonda says Leda lies.**\n3. **Shenna says Shalonda tells the truth.**\n4. **Christie says Shenna lies.**\n5. **Crista says Christie tells the truth.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Leda tells the truth, then Shalonda's statement that \"Leda lies\" is false. Therefore, Shalonda is lying.\n- If Shalonda is lying, then Shenna's statement that \"Shalonda tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Shenna is lying.\n- If Shenna is lying, then Christie's statement that \"Shenna lies\" is true. Therefore, Christie is telling the truth.\n- If Christie is telling the truth, then Crista's statement that \"Christie tells the truth\" is true. Therefore, Crista is telling the truth.\n\nThus, based on the logical deduction, Crista tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes, Crista tells the truth."
