    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Vernell lies.**\n   - If Vernell lies, then any statement Vernell makes is false.\n\n2. **Gwenn says Vernell lies.**\n   - If Gwenn is telling the truth, then Vernell indeed lies.\n   - If Gwenn is lying, then Vernell does not lie (i.e., Vernell tells the truth).\n\n3. **Teressa says Gwenn lies.**\n   - If Teressa is telling the truth, then Gwenn lies.\n   - If Teressa is lying, then Gwenn tells the truth.\n\n4. **Bernita says Teressa tells the truth.**\n   - If Bernita is telling the truth, then Teressa tells the truth.\n   - If Bernita is lying, then Teressa does not tell the truth (i.e., Teressa lies).\n\n5. **Christie says Bernita lies.**\n   - If Christie is telling the truth, then Bernita lies.\n   - If Christie is lying, then Bernita tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the chain of statements:\n\n- If Christie tells the truth, then Bernita lies.\n- If Bernita lies, then Teressa does not tell the truth (Teressa lies).\n- If Teressa lies, then Gwenn tells the truth.\n- If Gwenn tells the truth, then Vernell lies.\n\nThis chain of reasoning is consistent, meaning that if Christie tells the truth, all statements align logically.\n\nTherefore, Christie does tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes, Christie tells the truth.<<<answer>>>"
