    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Phoebe tells the truth.**\n2. **Christie says Phoebe tells the truth.**\n3. **Fletcher says Christie tells the truth.**\n4. **Amberly says Fletcher lies.**\n5. **Raymond says Amberly tells the truth.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Phoebe tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n- Christie says Phoebe tells the truth. If Christie is telling the truth, then Phoebe indeed tells the truth.\n- Fletcher says Christie tells the truth. If Fletcher is telling the truth, then Christie tells the truth, which means Phoebe tells the truth.\n- Amberly says Fletcher lies. If Amberly is telling the truth, then Fletcher is lying, which means Christie does not tell the truth, and thus Phoebe does not tell the truth. This creates a contradiction because we assumed Phoebe tells the truth.\n- Raymond says Amberly tells the truth. If Raymond is telling the truth, then Amberly tells the truth, which means Fletcher lies, leading to the same contradiction.\n\nTo resolve this, let's assume Phoebe does not tell the truth:\n\n- If Phoebe does not tell the truth, then Christie's statement is false, meaning Christie does not tell the truth.\n- If Christie does not tell the truth, then Fletcher's statement is false, meaning Fletcher does not tell the truth.\n- If Fletcher does not tell the truth, then Amberly's statement is true, meaning Amberly tells the truth.\n- If Amberly tells the truth, then Raymond's statement is true, meaning Raymond tells the truth.\n\nThis scenario does not lead to any contradictions. Therefore, Raymond tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
