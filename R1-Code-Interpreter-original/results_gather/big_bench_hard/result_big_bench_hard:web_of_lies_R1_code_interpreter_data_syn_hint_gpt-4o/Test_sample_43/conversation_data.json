    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Fletcher tells the truth.**\n2. **Helene says Fletcher lies.**\n3. **Elanor says Helene tells the truth.**\n4. **Yoland says Elanor tells the truth.**\n5. **Audrie says Yoland lies.**\n\nLet's start by assuming Fletcher tells the truth. If Fletcher tells the truth, then Helene's statement that Fletcher lies must be false. Therefore, Helene lies.\n\nIf Helene lies, then Elanor's statement that Helene tells the truth must also be false. Therefore, Elanor lies.\n\nIf Elanor lies, then Yoland's statement that Elanor tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Yoland lies.\n\nIf Yoland lies, then Audrie's statement that Yoland lies must be true. Therefore, Audrie tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of this assumption:\n\n- Fletcher tells the truth.\n- Helene lies.\n- Elanor lies.\n- Yoland lies.\n- Audrie tells the truth.\n\nThis scenario is consistent with all the statements. Therefore, Audrie does tell the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
