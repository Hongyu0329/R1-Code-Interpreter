    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n   - If Sima tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Yoland says Sima lies.**\n   - If Yoland is telling the truth, then Sima is lying. However, this contradicts Sima's statement that she tells the truth. Therefore, Yoland must be lying.\n\n3. **Amberly says Yoland tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Yoland is lying, Amberly's statement that Yoland tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Amberly is lying.\n\n4. **Inga says Amberly lies.**\n   - Since Amberly is indeed lying, Inga's statement is true. Therefore, Inga is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Alexis says Inga tells the truth.**\n   - Since Inga is telling the truth, Alexis's statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, Alexis tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
