    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Fidel lies.** - This is a given statement. Let's assume it is true for now.\n\n2. **Michael says Fidel lies.** - If Michael is telling the truth, then Fidel indeed lies, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\n3. **Fletcher says Michael lies.** - If Fletcher is telling the truth, then Michael is lying. But if Michael is lying, then Fidel does not lie, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, Fletcher must be lying, meaning Michael is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Inga says Fletcher tells the truth.** - Since we determined Fletcher is lying, Inga must be lying.\n\n5. **Andree says Inga lies.** - Since Inga is indeed lying, Andree is telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, Andree tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
