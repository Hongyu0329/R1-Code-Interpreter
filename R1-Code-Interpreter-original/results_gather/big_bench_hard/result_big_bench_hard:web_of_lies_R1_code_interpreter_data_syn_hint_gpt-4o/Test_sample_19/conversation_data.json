    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Fidel lies.**\n2. **Sal says Fidel tells the truth.**\n3. **Osvaldo says Sal lies.**\n4. **Alexis says Osvaldo lies.**\n5. **Millie says Alexis tells the truth.**\n\nLet's start by assuming that Fidel lies. If Fidel lies, then Sal's statement that \"Fidel tells the truth\" is false, which means Sal lies.\n\nIf Sal lies, then Osvaldo's statement that \"Sal lies\" is true, which means Osvaldo tells the truth.\n\nIf Osvaldo tells the truth, then Alexis's statement that \"Osvaldo lies\" is false, which means Alexis lies.\n\nIf Alexis lies, then Millie's statement that \"Alexis tells the truth\" is false, which means Millie lies.\n\nTherefore, based on the assumption that Fidel lies, we conclude that Millie lies.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite scenario where Fidel tells the truth. If Fidel tells the truth, then Sal's statement that \"Fidel tells the truth\" is true, which means Sal tells the truth.\n\nIf Sal tells the truth, then Osvaldo's statement that \"Sal lies\" is false, which means Osvaldo lies.\n\nIf Osvaldo lies, then Alexis's statement that \"Osvaldo lies\" is true, which means Alexis tells the truth.\n\nIf Alexis tells the truth, then Millie's statement that \"Alexis tells the truth\" is true, which means Millie tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, based on the assumption that Fidel tells the truth, we conclude that Millie tells the truth.\n\nSince we have two scenarios with different outcomes, we need to determine which scenario is consistent with all the statements. The first scenario (Fidel lies) leads to a consistent chain of truth and lies, while the second scenario (Fidel tells the truth) also leads to a consistent chain. However, the problem asks specifically if Millie tells the truth, and in the first scenario, Millie lies, while in the second scenario, Millie tells the truth.\n\nThus, the consistent scenario where Millie tells the truth is when Fidel tells the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
