    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Phoebe tells the truth.**\n   - If Phoebe tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Helene says Phoebe lies.**\n   - If Helene is telling the truth, then Phoebe is lying, which contradicts our assumption that Phoebe tells the truth. Therefore, Helene must be lying.\n\n3. **Sima says Helene lies.**\n   - Since Helene is lying, Sima's statement is true. Therefore, Sima tells the truth.\n\n4. **Alejandro says Sima tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sima tells the truth, Alejandro's statement is true. Therefore, Alejandro tells the truth.\n\n5. **Michaela says Alejandro lies.**\n   - Since Alejandro tells the truth, Michaela's statement is false. Therefore, Michaela is lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, Michaela does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>No, Michaela does not tell the truth."
