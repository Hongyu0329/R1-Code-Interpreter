    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n2. **Jim says Sima lies.**\n3. **Gwenn says Jim tells the truth.**\n4. **Phoebe says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n5. **Rashida says Phoebe lies.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Sima tells the truth, then Jim's statement that \"Sima lies\" is false. Therefore, Jim is lying.\n- If Jim is lying, then Gwenn's statement that \"Jim tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Gwenn is lying.\n- If Gwenn is lying, then Phoebe's statement that \"Gwenn tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Phoebe is lying.\n- If Phoebe is lying, then Rashida's statement that \"Phoebe lies\" is true. Therefore, Rashida is telling the truth.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Rashida tells the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
