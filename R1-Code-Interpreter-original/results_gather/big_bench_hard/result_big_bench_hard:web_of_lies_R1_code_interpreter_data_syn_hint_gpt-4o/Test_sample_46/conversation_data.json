    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency.\n\n1. **Millie tells the truth.**  \n   - This is a given statement. Let's assume it's true for now.\n\n2. **Millicent says Millie tells the truth.**  \n   - If Millie tells the truth, then Millicent is also telling the truth.\n\n3. **Raymond says Millicent tells the truth.**  \n   - If Millicent tells the truth, then Raymond is also telling the truth.\n\n4. **Crista says Raymond lies.**  \n   - If Raymond tells the truth, then Crista is lying.\n\n5. **Ka says Crista tells the truth.**  \n   - If Crista is lying, then Ka is also lying.\n\nLet's summarize the logical deductions:\n\n- If Millie tells the truth, then Millicent, Raymond, and Ka are also telling the truth, but Crista is lying.\n- If Crista is lying, then Ka, who says Crista tells the truth, must be lying.\n\nTherefore, Ka cannot be telling the truth because it leads to a contradiction. \n\nThus, the final answer is that Ka does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
