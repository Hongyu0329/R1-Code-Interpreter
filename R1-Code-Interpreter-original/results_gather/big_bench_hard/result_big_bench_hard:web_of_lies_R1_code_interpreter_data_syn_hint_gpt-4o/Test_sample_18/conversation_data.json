This contradicts the given statement that Shalonda tells the truth. Therefore, Christie must be lying.\n\n4. **Inga says Christie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Christie is lying, Inga must also be lying because she claims Christie tells the truth.\n\n5. **Crista says Inga tells the truth.**\n   - Since Inga is lying, Crista must also be lying because she claims Inga tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, Crista does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>No, Crista does not tell the truth."
