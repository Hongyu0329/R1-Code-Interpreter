    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - If Rashida tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Jim says Rashida lies.**\n   - If Jim is telling the truth, then Rashida is lying, which contradicts Rashida's statement that she tells the truth. Therefore, Jim must be lying.\n\n3. **Alejandro says Jim lies.**\n   - Since Jim is lying (as determined in step 2), Alejandro's statement is true. Therefore, Alejandro tells the truth.\n\n4. **Tamika says Alejandro tells the truth.**\n   - Since Alejandro tells the truth (as determined in step 3), Tamika's statement is true. Therefore, Tamika tells the truth.\n\n5. **Fidel says Tamika lies.**\n   - Since Tamika tells the truth (as determined in step 4), Fidel's statement is false. Therefore, Fidel is lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, Fidel does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>No, Fidel does not tell the truth."
