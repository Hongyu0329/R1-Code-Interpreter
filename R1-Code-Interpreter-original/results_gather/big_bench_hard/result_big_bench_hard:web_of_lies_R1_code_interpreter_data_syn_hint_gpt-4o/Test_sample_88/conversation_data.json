    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Helene tells the truth.**\n   - If Helene tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Lorine says Helene lies.**\n   - If Lorine is telling the truth, then Helene is lying, which contradicts Helene's statement that she tells the truth.\n   - If Lorine is lying, then Helene is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Raymond says Lorine tells the truth.**\n   - If Raymond is telling the truth, then Lorine is telling the truth, which means Helene is lying.\n   - If Raymond is lying, then Lorine is lying, which means Helene is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Ka says Raymond tells the truth.**\n   - If Ka is telling the truth, then Raymond is telling the truth, which means Lorine is telling the truth, and Helene is lying.\n   - If Ka is lying, then Raymond is lying, which means Lorine is lying, and Helene is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Christie says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - If Christie is telling the truth, then Ka is telling the truth, which means Raymond is telling the truth, Lorine is telling the truth, and Helene is lying.\n   - If Christie is lying, then Ka is lying, which means Raymond is lying, Lorine is lying, and Helene is telling the truth.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that if Christie is telling the truth, it leads to a contradiction because it implies Helene is lying, which contradicts Helene's statement that she tells the truth. Therefore, Christie must be lying.\n\nThus, Christie does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
