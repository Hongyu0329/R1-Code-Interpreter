    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Fidel tells the truth.**\n   - If Fidel tells the truth, then his statement is true.\n\n2. **Tamika says Fidel lies.**\n   - If Tamika is telling the truth, then Fidel is lying, which contradicts our assumption that Fidel tells the truth. Therefore, Tamika must be lying.\n\n3. **Shenna says Tamika lies.**\n   - Since Tamika is lying, Shenna's statement is true.\n\n4. **Audrie says Shenna lies.**\n   - Since Shenna is telling the truth, Audrie's statement is false, meaning Audrie is lying.\n\n5. **Jim says Audrie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Audrie is lying, Jim's statement is false, meaning Jim is also lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, Jim does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
