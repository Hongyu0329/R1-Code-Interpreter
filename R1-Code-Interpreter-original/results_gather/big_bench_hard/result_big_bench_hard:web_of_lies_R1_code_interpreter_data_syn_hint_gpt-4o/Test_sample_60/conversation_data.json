    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Delbert tells the truth.**\n   - If Delbert tells the truth, then his statement is true.\n\n2. **Delfina says Delbert lies.**\n   - If Delfina is telling the truth, then Delbert is lying, which contradicts our assumption that Delbert tells the truth. Therefore, Delfina must be lying.\n\n3. **Antwan says Delfina tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have determined that Delfina is lying, Antwan's statement that Delfina tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Antwan is lying.\n\n4. **Helene says Antwan lies.**\n   - Since Antwan is lying, Helene's statement that Antwan lies is true. Therefore, Helene is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Sima says Helene lies.**\n   - Since Helene is telling the truth, Sima's statement that Helene lies must be false.
