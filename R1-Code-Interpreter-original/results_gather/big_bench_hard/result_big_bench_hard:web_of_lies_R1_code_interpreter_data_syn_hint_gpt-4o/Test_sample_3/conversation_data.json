    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Christie tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement.\n\n2. **Ka says Christie tells the truth.**\n   - If Ka is telling the truth, then Christie is indeed telling the truth, which aligns with the given statement.\n\n3. **Delbert says Ka lies.**\n   - If Delbert is telling the truth, then Ka is lying, which contradicts Ka's statement that Christie tells the truth. This would mean Christie is lying, which contradicts the initial statement that Christie tells the truth.\n\n4. **Leda says Delbert tells the truth.**\n   - If Leda is telling the truth, then Delbert is telling the truth, which means Ka is lying, and Christie is lying, contradicting the initial statement.\n\n5. **Lorine says Leda tells the truth.**\n   - If Lorine is telling the truth, then Leda is telling the truth, which means Delbert is telling the truth, leading to the same contradiction as before.\n\nTo resolve this, let's assume Christie tells the truth (as given), and analyze the implications:\n\n- If Christie tells the truth, then Ka is also telling the truth.\n- If Ka is telling the truth, then Delbert must be lying (since Delbert says Ka lies).\n- If Delbert is lying, then Leda is also lying (since Leda says Delbert tells the truth).\n- If Leda is lying, then Lorine is also lying (since Lorine says Leda tells the truth).\n\nTherefore, Lorine does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>No, Lorine does not tell the truth."
