    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Jamey lies.**\n   - If Jamey lies, then any statement Jamey makes is false.\n\n2. **Raymond says Jamey lies.**\n   - If Raymond tells the truth, then Jamey indeed lies.\n   - If Raymond lies, then Jamey tells the truth.\n\n3. **Ka says Raymond lies.**\n   - If Ka tells the truth, then Raymond lies.\n   - If Ka lies, then Raymond tells the truth.\n\n4. **Bernita says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - If Bernita tells the truth, then Ka tells the truth.\n   - If Bernita lies, then Ka lies.\n\n5. **Teressa says Bernita lies.**\n   - If Teressa tells the truth, then Bernita lies.\n   - If Teressa lies, then Bernita tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Jamey lies, then Raymond tells the truth (since he says Jamey lies), which means Ka lies (since Ka says Raymond lies), which means Bernita lies (since Bernita says Ka tells the truth), which means Teressa tells the truth (since Teressa says Bernita lies).\n\n- If Jamey tells the truth, then Raymond lies (since he says Jamey lies), which means Ka tells the truth (since Ka says Raymond lies), which means Bernita tells the truth (since Bernita says Ka tells the truth), which means Teressa lies (since Teressa says Bernita lies).\n\nIn both scenarios, Teressa's statement is consistent with the truthfulness of the other statements. Therefore, Teressa tells the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
