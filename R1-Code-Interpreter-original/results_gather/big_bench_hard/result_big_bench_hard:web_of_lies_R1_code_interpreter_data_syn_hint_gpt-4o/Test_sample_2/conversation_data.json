    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement and ultimately find out if Ka tells the truth.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. **Vina tells the truth.**\n2. **Helene says Vina lies.**\n3. **Kandi says Helene tells the truth.**\n4. **Jamey says Kandi lies.**\n5. **Ka says Jamey lies.**\n\nWe need to determine the truthfulness of each statement logically:\n\n- If Vina tells the truth, then Helene's statement that Vina lies is false.\n- If Helene's statement is false, then Kandi's statement that Helene tells the truth is also false.\n- If Kandi's statement is false, then Jamey's statement that Kandi lies is true.\n- If Jamey's statement is true, then Ka's statement that Jamey lies is false.\n\nLet's verify this logic:\n\n1. Assume Vina tells the truth.\n   - Helene says Vina lies, which is false.\n   - Kandi says Helene tells the truth, which is false.\n   - Jamey says Kandi lies, which is true.\n   - Ka says Jamey lies, which is false.\n\nThis logic is consistent, meaning Vina tells the truth, and Ka does not tell the truth.\n\nTherefore, Ka does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
