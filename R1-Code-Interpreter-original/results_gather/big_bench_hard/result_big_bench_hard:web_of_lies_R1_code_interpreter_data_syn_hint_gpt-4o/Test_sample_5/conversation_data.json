    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical implications of their statements.\n\n1. **Vernell tells the truth.**\n   - This is our starting point. If Vernell tells the truth, then his statement is true.\n\n2. **Kandi says Vernell tells the truth.**\n   - If Kandi is telling the truth, then Vernell's statement is true, which aligns with our assumption that Vernell tells the truth.\n\n3. **Alexis says Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - If Alexis is telling the truth, then Kandi's statement is true, which means Vernell tells the truth.\n\n4. **Sima says Alexis lies.**\n   - If Sima is telling the truth, then Alexis is lying, which means Kandi is not telling the truth, and therefore Vernell is not telling the truth. This contradicts our initial assumption that Vernell tells the truth.\n\n5. **Phoebe says Sima tells the truth.**\n   - If Phoebe is telling the truth, then Sima's statement is true, which means Alexis is lying, and therefore Kandi is not telling the truth, and Vernell is not telling the truth. This again contradicts our initial assumption.\n\nSince assuming Vernell tells the truth leads to contradictions, we must assume Vernell is lying. Let's re-evaluate the statements with this assumption:\n\n1. **Vernell lies.**\n   - Vernell's statement is false.\n\n2. **Kandi says Vernell tells the truth.**\n   - If Kandi is lying, then Vernell is lying, which aligns with our assumption.\n\n3. **Alexis says Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - If Alexis is lying, then Kandi is lying, which aligns with our assumption.\n\n4. **Sima says Alexis lies.**\n   - If Sima is telling the truth, then Alexis is lying, which aligns with our assumption.\n\n5. **Phoebe says Sima tells the truth.**\n   - If Phoebe is telling the truth, then Sima's statement is true, which means Alexis is lying, and this aligns with our assumption.\n\nTherefore, Phoebe is telling the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
