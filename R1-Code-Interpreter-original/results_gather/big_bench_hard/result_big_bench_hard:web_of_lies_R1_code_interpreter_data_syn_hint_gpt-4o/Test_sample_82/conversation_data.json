    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Elanor lies.**\n2. **Tamika says Elanor lies.**\n3. **Ka says Tamika tells the truth.**\n4. **Shaunda says Ka lies.**\n5. **Conception says Shaunda lies.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Elanor lies, then Tamika's statement that \"Elanor lies\" is true.\n- If Tamika tells the truth, then Ka's statement that \"Tamika tells the truth\" is also true.\n- If Ka tells the truth, then Shaunda's statement that \"Ka lies\" is false.\n- If Shaunda lies, then Conception's statement that \"Shaunda lies\" is true.\n\nNow, let's check the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Elanor lies, then Tamika tells the truth.\n- If Tamika tells the truth, then Ka tells the truth.\n- If Ka tells the truth, then Shaunda lies.\n- If Shaunda lies, then Conception tells the truth.\n\nThis chain of reasoning is consistent. Therefore, Conception tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
