    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Sherrie tells the truth.**  \n   - This is a given statement.\n\n2. **Vernell says Sherrie tells the truth.**  \n   - If Vernell is telling the truth, then Sherrie is indeed telling the truth, which is consistent with the given statement.\n\n3. **Alexis says Vernell lies.**  \n   - If Alexis is telling the truth, then Vernell is lying, which contradicts Vernell's statement that Sherrie tells the truth. This would mean Sherrie is lying, which contradicts the initial statement that Sherrie tells the truth.\n\n4. **Michaela says Alexis tells the truth.**  \n   - If Michaela is telling the truth, then Alexis is telling the truth, which means Vernell is lying, and Sherrie is lying. This contradicts the initial statement that Sherrie tells the truth.\n\n5. **Elanor says Michaela tells the truth.**  \n   - If Elanor is telling the truth, then Michaela is telling the truth, which means Alexis is telling the truth, Vernell is lying, and Sherrie is lying. Again, this contradicts the initial statement that Sherrie tells the truth.\n\nFrom the above analysis, if Sherrie tells the truth, then Vernell must also be telling the truth. This means Alexis is lying, which means Michaela is lying, and therefore, Elanor is lying.\n\nThus, Elanor does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
