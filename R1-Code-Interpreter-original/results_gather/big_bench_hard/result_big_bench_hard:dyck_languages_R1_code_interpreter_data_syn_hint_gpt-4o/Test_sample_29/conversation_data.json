    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is `{ { } ( ( ) )`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `{` - Open a curly brace.\n2. `{` - Open another curly brace.\n3. `}` - Close the last opened curly brace.\n4. `(` - Open a parenthesis.\n5. `(` - Open another parenthesis.\n6. `)` - Close the last opened parenthesis.\n7. `)` - Close the last opened parenthesis.\n\nNow, let's check if all opened parentheses and braces are closed:\n\n- The first `{` is not closed.\n- The second `{` is closed by the third character `}`.\n- The first `(` is closed by the sixth character `)`.\n- The second `(` is closed by the seventh character `)`.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to close the first `{` with a `}` at the end.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be: `{ { } ( ( ) ) }`.\n\n<<<answer>>>{ { } ( ( ) ) }<<<answer>>>"
