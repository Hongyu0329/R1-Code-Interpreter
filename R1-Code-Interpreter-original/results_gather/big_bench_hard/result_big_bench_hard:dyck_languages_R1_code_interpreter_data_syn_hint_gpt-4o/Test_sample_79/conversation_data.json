    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: `<`, `[`, `(`, and `{`. Each type of bracket must be closed in the reverse order of its opening.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` is opened and needs to be closed with `>`.\n2. `[` is opened and needs to be closed with `]`.\n3. `(` is opened and needs to be closed with `)`.\n4. `[` is opened and needs to be closed with `]`.\n5. `(` is opened and needs to be closed with `)`.\n6. `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n7. `[` is opened and needs to be closed with `]`.\n8. `<` is opened and needs to be closed with `>`.\n9. `[` is opened and needs to be closed with `]`.\n10. `<` is opened and needs to be closed with `>`.\n11. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n12. `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n13. `<` is opened and needs to be closed with `>`.\n14. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n15. `[` is opened and needs to be closed with `]`.\n16. `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n17. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n18. `<` is opened and needs to be closed with `>`.\n19. `<` is opened and needs to be closed with `>`.\n20. `(` is opened and needs to be closed with `)`.\n21. `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n22. `(` is opened and needs to be closed with `)`.\n23. `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n24. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n25. `<` is opened and needs to be closed with `>`.\n26. `{` is opened and needs to be closed with `}`.\n27. `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n28. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n29. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n30. `[` is opened and needs to be closed with `]`.\n31. `<` is opened and needs to be closed with `>`.\n32. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n33. `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n\nNow, let's check the sequence to see which brackets are still open and need to be closed:\n\n- `<` opened at the start is still open.\n- `[` opened after the first `<` is still open.\n\nThus, the sequence needs to be completed by closing these brackets in the reverse order of their opening.\n\nThe final sequence should be: `< [ ( [ ( ) [ < [ < > ] < > [ ] > ] < < ( ) ( ) > < { } > > [ < > ] ] > ] >`\n\n<<<answer>>>"
