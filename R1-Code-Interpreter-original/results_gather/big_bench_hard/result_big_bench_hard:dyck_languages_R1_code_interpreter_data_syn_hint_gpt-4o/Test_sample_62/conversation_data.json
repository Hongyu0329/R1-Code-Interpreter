    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, angle brackets `<>`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`.\n\nLet's break down the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `( ( < [ { { } } ] > { } ) ( < > ) [ ( < > ) ] <`\n\n2. **Matching Brackets**:\n   - The first `(` needs a `)`.\n   - The second `(` needs a `)`.\n   - The `<` needs a `>`.\n   - The `[` needs a `]`.\n   - The `{` needs a `}`.\n   - The second `{` needs a `}`.\n   - The `[` is closed by `]`.\n   - The `<` is closed by `>`.\n   - The `{` is closed by `}`.\n   - The first `(` is closed by `)`.\n   - The second `(` is closed by `)`.\n   - The `<` is closed by `>`.\n   - The `[` is closed by `]`.\n   - The `(` is closed by `)`.\n   - The `<` is closed by `>`.\n\n3. **Remaining Open Brackets**:\n   - We have an unclosed `<` at the end of the sequence.\n\n4. **Closing the Remaining Brackets**:\n   - The remaining `<` needs to be closed with a `>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `( ( < [ { { } } ] > { } ) ( < > ) [ ( < > ) ] < > )`.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
