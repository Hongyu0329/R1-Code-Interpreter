    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses such that all opened parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is \"( < >\". \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first character is '(', which is an open parenthesis. It needs a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.\n2. The second character is '<', which is an open angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket '>'.\n3. The third character is '>', which is a closing angle bracket. This matches with the previously opened '<'.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that all opened parentheses and brackets are closed properly. The sequence currently has:\n\n- One open parenthesis '(' that needs to be closed.\n- The angle brackets '<' and '>' are already matched.\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to add a closing parenthesis ')' at the end.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is \"( < > )\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
