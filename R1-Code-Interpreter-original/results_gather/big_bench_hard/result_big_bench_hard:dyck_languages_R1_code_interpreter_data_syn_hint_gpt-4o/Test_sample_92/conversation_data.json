    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ [ < [ ] > ] ] <\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The sequence starts with an open square bracket `[`.\n2. Inside it, there's an open angle bracket `<`.\n3. Inside the angle bracket, there's another open square bracket `[`.\n4. Then, there's a closed square bracket `]`, which closes the innermost square bracket.\n5. Next, there's a closed angle bracket `>`, which closes the angle bracket.\n6. Then, there's a closed square bracket `]`, which closes the first square bracket.\n7. Finally, there's an open angle bracket `<`.\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to close the last open angle bracket. Therefore, we should add a closing angle bracket `>` at the end.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ [ < [ ] > ] ] < >\n\nNow, let's output the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
