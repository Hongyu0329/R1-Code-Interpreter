    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is \"< [ ]\". \n\n1. The sequence starts with \"<\", which is an opening angle bracket.\n2. It is followed by \"[\", which is an opening square bracket.\n3. Then, there is \"]\", which is a closing square bracket.\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to close the angle bracket that was opened at the beginning. Therefore, the sequence should end with \">\".\n\nThe complete sequence should be \"< [ ] >\".\n\n<<<answer>>> < [ ] > <<<answer>>>"
