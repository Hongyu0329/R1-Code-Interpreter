    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n```\n{ { [ { < { } > } ( ) ]\n```\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `{` - Open curly brace\n2. `{` - Open curly brace\n3. `[` - Open square bracket\n4. `{` - Open curly brace\n5. `<` - Open angle bracket\n6. `{` - Open curly brace\n7. `}` - Close curly brace (matches the last opened `{`)\n8. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the last opened `<`)\n9. `}` - Close curly brace (matches the last opened `{`)\n10. `(` - Open parenthesis\n11. `)` - Close parenthesis (matches the last opened `(`)\n12. `]` - Close square bracket (matches the last opened `[`)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- We have two `{` that are still open.\n\nTherefore, we need to add two `}` to close the sequence properly.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n```\n{ { [ { < { } > } ( ) ] } }\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that all brackets are properly closed and nested.\n\n<<<answer>>> { { [ { < { } > } ( ) ] } } <<<answer>>>"
