    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is \"( { ( )\". \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first character is '(', which needs a matching ')'.\n2. The second character is '{', which needs a matching '}'.\n3. The third character is '(', which is closed by the fourth character ')'.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open parentheses:\n\n- The first '(' needs a closing ')'.\n- The '{' needs a closing '}'.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n- Start with the given sequence: ( { ( )\n- Add a ')' to close the first '('.\n- Add a '}' to close the '{'.\n\nThe completed sequence is: ( { ( ) ) }\n\n<<<'( { ( ) ) }'>>>"
