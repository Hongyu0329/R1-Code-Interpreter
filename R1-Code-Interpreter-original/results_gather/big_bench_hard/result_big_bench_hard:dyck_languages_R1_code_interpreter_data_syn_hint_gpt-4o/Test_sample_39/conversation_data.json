    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, angle brackets `<>`, and curly braces `{}`. \n\nThe input sequence is: \n```\n( ( [ < < > [ < { } > ] { < [ ] > ( ( ( [ [ { < > } ] ] ) ) ) ( < < > > ) } > ]\n```\n\nLet's break down the sequence to understand the nesting and ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket:\n\n1. Start with the first `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n2. The next `(` also needs a closing `)`.\n3. The `[` needs a closing `]`.\n4. The `<` needs a closing `>`.\n5. The next `<` needs a closing `>`.\n6. The `>` closes the second `<`.\n7. The `[` needs a closing `]`.\n8. The `<` needs a closing `>`.\n9. The `{` needs a closing `}`.\n10. The `}` closes the `{`.\n11. The `>` closes the `<`.\n12. The `]` closes the `[` from step 7.\n13. The `{` needs a closing `}`.\n14. The `<` needs a closing `>`.\n15. The `[` needs a closing `]`.\n16. The `]` closes the `[` from step 15.\n17. The `>` closes the `<` from step 14.\n18. The `(` needs a closing `)`.\n19. The `(` needs a closing `)`.\n20. The `(` needs a closing `)`.\n21. The `[` needs a closing `]`.\n22. The `[` needs a closing `]`.\n23. The `{` needs a closing `}`.\n24. The `<` needs a closing `>`.\n25. The `>` closes the `<`.\n26. The `}` closes the `{`.\n27. The `]` closes the `[` from step 22.\n28. The `]` closes the `[` from step 21.\n29. The `)` closes the `(` from step 20.\n30. The `)` closes the `(` from step 19.\n31. The `)` closes the `(` from step 18.\n32. The `(` needs a closing `)`.\n33. The `<` needs a closing `>`.\n34. The `<` needs a closing `>`.\n35. The `>` closes the `<`.\n36. The `>` closes the `<`.\n37. The `)` closes the `(` from step 32.\n38. The `}` closes the `{` from step 13.\n39. The `>` closes the `<` from step 4.\n40. The `]` closes the `[` from step 3.\n41. The `)` closes the `(` from step 2.\n42. The `)` closes the `(` from step 1.\n\nNow, let's write the complete sequence with all the brackets properly closed:\n\n```\n( ( [ < < > [ < { } > ] { < [ ] > ( ( ( [ [ { < > } ] ] ) ) ) ( < < > > ) } > ] ) )\n```\n\nThe sequence is now complete and properly nested. \n\n<<<answer>>>"
