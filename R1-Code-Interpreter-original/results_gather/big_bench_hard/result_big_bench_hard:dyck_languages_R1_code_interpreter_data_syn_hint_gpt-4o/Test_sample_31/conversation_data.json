    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets such that all the parentheses, square brackets, and angle brackets are properly closed. The input sequence is: `( < [ ( )`.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `(`: This is an open parenthesis. It needs a corresponding `)` to close it.\n2. `<`: This is an open angle bracket. It needs a corresponding `>` to close it.\n3. `[`: This is an open square bracket. It needs a corresponding `]` to close it.\n4. `(`: This is another open parenthesis. It needs a corresponding `)` to close it.\n5. `)`: This is a closing parenthesis, which closes the last open parenthesis.\n\nNow, let's determine the remaining brackets needed to close all the open brackets:\n\n- The first `(` is not yet closed, so we need a `)` to close it.\n- The `<` is not yet closed, so we need a `>` to close it.\n- The `[` is not yet closed, so we need a `]` to close it.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows: `( < [ ( ) ) > ]`.\n\nLet's verify this by checking the order of opening and closing:\n\n- The first `(` is closed by the first `)`.\n- The second `(` is closed by the second `)`.\n- The `<` is closed by the `>`.\n- The `[` is closed by the `]`.\n\nAll brackets are properly closed in the correct order.\n\n<<<'( < [ ( ) ) > ]'>>>"
