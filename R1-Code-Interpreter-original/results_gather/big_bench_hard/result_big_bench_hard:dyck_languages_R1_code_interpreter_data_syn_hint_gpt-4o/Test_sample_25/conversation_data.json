    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the brackets are properly closed in the sequence. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ < \\{ [ ] \\} >\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The sequence starts with an open square bracket `[`.\n2. Next, there is an open angle bracket `<`.\n3. Then, there is an open curly brace `{`.\n4. After that, there is a closed square bracket `]`. This matches the first open square bracket `[`.\n5. Next, there is a closed curly brace `}`. This matches the open curly brace `{`.\n6. Finally, there is an open angle bracket `>`.\n\nThe sequence is missing a closing angle bracket `>` to match the open angle bracket `<`.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence should be:\n\n\\[ < \\{ [ ] \\} > \\]\n\nThe sequence is now properly closed with all brackets matched.\n\n<<<answer>>>[ < { [ ] } >]<<<answer>>>"
