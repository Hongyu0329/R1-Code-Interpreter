    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is `( { { } }`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis.\n2. `{` - This is an opening curly brace.\n3. `{` - This is another opening curly brace.\n4. `}` - This is a closing curly brace. It matches the last opened curly brace.\n5. `}` - This is another closing curly brace. It matches the first opened curly brace.\n\nNow, we have one opening parenthesis `(` that is not yet closed. To balance the sequence, we need to add a closing parenthesis `)` at the end.\n\nThus, the complete sequence should be `( { { } } )`.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<'( { { } } )'>>>"
