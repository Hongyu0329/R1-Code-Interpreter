    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly closed. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ < < { } > < > > ( ) \\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **[**: This is the first bracket, and it needs to be closed at the end.\n2. **<**: This is the second bracket, and it needs to be closed before the first bracket.\n3. **<**: This is the third bracket, and it needs to be closed before the second bracket.\n4. **{**: This is the fourth bracket, and it needs to be closed before the third bracket.\n5. **}**: This closes the fourth bracket.\n6. **>**: This closes the third bracket.\n7. **<**: This is a new bracket, and it needs to be closed before the second bracket.\n8. **>**: This closes the new bracket.\n9. **>**: This closes the second bracket.\n10. **(**: This is a new bracket, and it needs to be closed before the first bracket.\n11. **)**: This closes the new bracket.\n\nNow, we need to close the first bracket, which is **[**. Therefore, the complete sequence with properly closed brackets is:\n\n\\[ < < { } > < > > ( ) \\]\n\nThe sequence is already complete and properly closed. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
