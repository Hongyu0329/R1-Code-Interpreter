    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly closed. The sequence given is:\n\n`< { ( { } ) < > }`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` is opened first.\n2. `{` is opened next.\n3. `(` is opened next.\n4. `{` is opened next.\n5. `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n6. `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n7. `<` is opened next.\n8. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n9. `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n\nNow, we need to close the first opened `<`. Therefore, the complete sequence should be:\n\n`< { ( { } ) < > } >`\n\nThe sequence is now properly closed. \n\n<<<answer>>> < { ( { } ) < > } > <<<answer>>>"
