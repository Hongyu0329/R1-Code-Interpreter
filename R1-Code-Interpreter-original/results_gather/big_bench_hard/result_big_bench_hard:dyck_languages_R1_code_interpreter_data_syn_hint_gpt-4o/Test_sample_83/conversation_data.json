    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is `{ < [ ]`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `{` - This is an opening curly brace. It needs a corresponding closing curly brace `}`.\n2. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n3. `[` - This is an opening square bracket. It needs a corresponding closing square bracket `]`.\n4. `]` - This is a closing square bracket, which matches the opening square bracket `[`.\n\nNow, we need to add the closing brackets for the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The angle bracket `<` needs a closing `>`.\n- The curly brace `{` needs a closing `}`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be `{ < [ ] > }`.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> { < [ ] > } <<<answer>>>"
