    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. The sequence provided is:\n\nInput: ( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) >\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The sequence starts with an open parenthesis `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n2. Next, we have an open angle bracket `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n3. Then, we have an open curly brace `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n4. Inside the curly braces, we have a pair of parentheses `( )`, which are already closed.\n5. After the parentheses, we have another pair of curly braces `{ }`, which are already closed.\n6. The curly brace `{` from step 3 is closed by the `}` after the second pair of curly braces.\n7. Next, we have an open parenthesis `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n8. Inside this parenthesis, we have an open angle bracket `<`, which is closed by the `>` immediately following it.\n9. The parenthesis from step 7 is closed by the `)` after the angle brackets.\n10. The angle bracket `<` from step 2 is closed by the `>` at the end of the sequence.\n\nNow, we need to close the initial open parenthesis `(` from step 1. Therefore, the complete sequence with properly closed parentheses, brackets, and braces is:\n\n( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) > )\n\nThe sequence is now balanced and all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed.\n\n<<<answer>>> ( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) > ) <<<answer>>>"
