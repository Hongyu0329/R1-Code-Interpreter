    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is `{ < { } > { (`. We need to determine the correct closing brackets for this sequence.\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets**: The sequence starts with `{`, followed by `<`, then another `{`, and finally `(`. These are the opening brackets that need corresponding closing brackets.\n\n2. **Identify the closing brackets**: The sequence already has a `}` and a `>`, which close the second `{` and the `<`, respectively.\n\n3. **Determine the remaining brackets to close**:\n   - The first `{` is not closed.\n   - The last `{` is not closed.\n   - The `(` is not closed.\n\n4. **Close the brackets in the correct order**: \n   - The last opened bracket is `(`, so it should be closed first with `)`.\n   - Next, the `{` that was opened before the `(` should be closed with `}`.\n   - Finally, the first `{` should be closed with `}`.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows: `{ < { } > { ( ) } }`.\n\n<<<'{ < { } > { ( ) } }'>>>"
