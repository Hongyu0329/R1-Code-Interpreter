    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets and parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is:\n\n`< < [ ] > ( < > ) <`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `< <`: Two opening angle brackets.\n2. `[ ]`: A pair of square brackets, which is already balanced.\n3. `>`: A closing angle bracket, which balances one of the opening angle brackets.\n4. `( < > )`: A pair of parentheses with a pair of angle brackets inside, which is balanced.\n5. `<`: An additional opening angle bracket.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining unbalanced opening angle brackets. We have two opening angle brackets (`< <`) and one closing angle bracket (`>`), so we need one more closing angle bracket to balance the sequence.\n\nThus, the complete sequence should be:\n\n`< < [ ] > ( < > ) < >`\n\nThis sequence is now balanced with all brackets and parentheses properly closed.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
