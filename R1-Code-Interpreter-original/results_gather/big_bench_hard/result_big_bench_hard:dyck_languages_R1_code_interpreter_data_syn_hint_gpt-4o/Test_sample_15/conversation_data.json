    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, and the sequence is balanced.\n\nThe given input is: `< { < > } { (`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<`: This is an opening angle bracket. We need a closing `>` for it.\n2. `{`: This is an opening curly brace. We need a closing `}` for it.\n3. `< >`: This is a complete pair of angle brackets.\n4. `}`: This is a closing curly brace, which matches the second character `{`.\n5. `{`: This is another opening curly brace. We need a closing `}` for it.\n6. `(`: This is an opening parenthesis. We need a closing `)` for it.\n\nNow, let's determine the necessary closing brackets to balance the sequence:\n\n- We have an unmatched opening `<` from the first character.\n- We have an unmatched opening `{` from the fifth character.\n- We have an unmatched opening `(` from the sixth character.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to add the corresponding closing brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- First, close the `(` with `)`.\n- Then, close the `{` with `}`.\n- Finally, close the `<` with `>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `< { < > } { ( ) } >`\n\n<<<answer>>>"
