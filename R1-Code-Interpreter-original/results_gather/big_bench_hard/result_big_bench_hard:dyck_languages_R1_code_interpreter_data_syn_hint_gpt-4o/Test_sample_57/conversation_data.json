    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is \"< > {\". \n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: \n   - The sequence starts with an opening angle bracket \"<\".\n   - It is followed by a closing angle bracket \">\", which closes the first bracket.\n   - Then, there is an opening curly brace \"{\".\n\n2. **Determine the Closing Brackets**:\n   - Since we have an opening curly brace \"{\", we need to close it with a closing curly brace \"}\".\n   - The sequence \"< >\" is already balanced, so we only need to focus on closing the curly brace.\n\n3. **Complete the Sequence**:\n   - The sequence \"< > {\" needs to be completed by adding a closing curly brace \"}\" to ensure all brackets are properly closed.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is \"< > { }\".\n\n<<<answer>>> < > { } <<<answer>>>"
