    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is `{ ( [ ] )`. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. `{` is an opening brace, so we need a closing brace `}`.\n2. `(` is an opening parenthesis, so we need a closing parenthesis `)`.\n3. `[` is an opening bracket, and `]` is its corresponding closing bracket. This part is already balanced.\n4. `)` is a closing parenthesis, which matches the opening parenthesis `(`.\n\nNow, we need to add the closing brace `}` to match the opening brace `{`.\n\nThe complete sequence should be `{ ( [ ] ) }`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> { ( [ ] ) } <<<answer>>>"
