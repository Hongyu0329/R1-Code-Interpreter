    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is \"( [ ( )\". \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first character is '(', which is an opening parenthesis.\n2. The second character is '[', which is an opening bracket.\n3. The third character is '(', which is another opening parenthesis.\n4. The fourth character is ')', which closes the most recent opening parenthesis '('.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets and parentheses:\n\n- We have an open '[' that needs to be closed with a ']'.\n- We have an open '(' that needs to be closed with a ')'.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows: \"( [ ( ) ] )\".\n\nThe final sequence is balanced and all parentheses and brackets are properly closed.\n\n<<<'( [ ( ) ] )'>>>"
