    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced. A balanced sequence means that every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')', and they are properly nested.\n\nGiven the input sequence: ( ( ( ) )\n\nLet's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The first three characters are '(', '(', and '(', which are opening parentheses. We need three corresponding closing parentheses to balance them.\n2. The next character is ')', which closes one of the previously opened parentheses. Now, we have two unclosed opening parentheses.\n3. The final character in the input is ')', which closes another opening parenthesis. Now, we have one unclosed opening parenthesis.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need one more closing parenthesis ')' to match the remaining unclosed opening parenthesis.\n\nThus, the complete balanced sequence is: ( ( ( ) ) )\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<'( ( ( ) ) )'>>>"
