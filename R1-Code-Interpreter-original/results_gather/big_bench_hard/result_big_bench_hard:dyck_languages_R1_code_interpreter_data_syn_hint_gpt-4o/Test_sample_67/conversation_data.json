    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, angle brackets `< >`, parentheses `( )`, and curly braces `{ }`.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `[`: This is an opening square bracket.\n2. `[`: Another opening square bracket.\n3. `<`: An opening angle bracket.\n4. `[`: An opening square bracket.\n5. `(`: An opening parenthesis.\n6. `[`: An opening square bracket.\n7. `<`: An opening angle bracket.\n8. `[`: An opening square bracket.\n9. `]`: A closing square bracket for the last opened square bracket.\n10. `>`: A closing angle bracket for the last opened angle bracket.\n11. `]`: A closing square bracket for the last opened square bracket.\n12. `)`: A closing parenthesis for the last opened parenthesis.\n13. `]`: A closing square bracket for the last opened square bracket.\n14. `>`: A closing angle bracket for the last opened angle bracket.\n15. `]`: A closing square bracket for the last opened square bracket.\n16. `(`: An opening parenthesis.\n17. `{`: An opening curly brace.\n18. `}`: A closing curly brace for the last opened curly brace.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The last opened bracket is `(`, so we need a `)` to close it.\n- Before that, we have two opened square brackets `[[`, so we need two `]` to close them.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n- Add `]` to close the first opened square bracket.\n- Add `]` to close the second opened square bracket.\n- Add `)` to close the opened parenthesis.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n`[ [ < [ ( [ < [ ] > ] ) ] > ] ( { } ) ] ]`\n\n<<<'[ [ < [ ( [ < [ ] > ] ) ] > ] ( { } ) ] ]'>>>"
