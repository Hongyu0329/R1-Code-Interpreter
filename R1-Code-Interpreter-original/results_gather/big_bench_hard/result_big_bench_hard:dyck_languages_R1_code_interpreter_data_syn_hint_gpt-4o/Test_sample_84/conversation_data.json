    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n( { } ) < { < { } >\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The first part is `( { } )`, which is already complete with matching parentheses.\n2. The next part is `< { < { } >`. Here, we have:\n   - An opening `<` which needs a closing `>`.\n   - An opening `{` which needs a closing `}`.\n   - Another opening `<` which needs a closing `>`.\n   - An opening `{` which is closed by `}`.\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- Close the innermost `<` with `>`.\n- Close the `{` with `}`.\n- Finally, close the outermost `<` with `>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n( { } ) < { < { } > } >\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
