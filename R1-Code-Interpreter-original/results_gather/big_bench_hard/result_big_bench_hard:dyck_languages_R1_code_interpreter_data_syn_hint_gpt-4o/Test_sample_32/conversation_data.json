    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) \\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The sequence starts with a square bracket `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n2. Inside the square bracket, we have an angle bracket `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n3. Inside the angle bracket, we have another square bracket `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n4. Inside this square bracket, we have:\n   - An angle bracket `< >`, which is already closed.\n   - A curly brace `{ < > }`, which is already closed.\n   - Another square bracket `[ [ ] ]`, which is already closed.\n\n5. After closing the innermost square bracket, we need to close the angle bracket `<` that was opened at step 2.\n6. After closing the angle bracket, we need to close the square bracket `[` that was opened at step 1.\n7. Finally, we need to close the parenthesis `(` that was opened after the first square bracket.\n\nNow, let's complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets:\n\n\\[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ] > \\]\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ] > \\]\n\nThis sequence ensures that all brackets are properly closed in the correct order.\n\n<<<answer>>>[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ] ><<<answer>>>"
