    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets are properly closed in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n< ( ( ( [ { } ] )\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` is an opening angle bracket, so it needs a closing `>`.\n2. `(` is an opening parenthesis, so it needs a closing `)`.\n3. Another `(`, so another `)`.\n4. Another `(`, so another `)`.\n5. `[` is an opening square bracket, so it needs a closing `]`.\n6. `{` is an opening curly brace, so it needs a closing `}`.\n7. `}` is already closed.\n8. `]` is already closed.\n9. `)` is already closed.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- The last opened bracket is `(`, so we close it with `)`.\n- The next is another `(`, so we close it with `)`.\n- The next is another `(`, so we close it with `)`.\n- Finally, the first opened bracket is `<`, so we close it with `>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n< ( ( ( [ { } ] ) ) ) >\n\n<<<answer>>>"
