    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all the parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is `< [ < > ]`.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n2. `[` - This is an opening square bracket. It needs a corresponding closing square bracket `]`.\n3. `<` - This is another opening angle bracket. It is closed by the next `>`.\n4. `>` - This closes the second `<`.\n5. `]` - This closes the `[`.\n\nNow, we need to close the first `<` that was opened. Therefore, we need to add a `>` at the end of the sequence.\n\nThe completed sequence should be: `< [ < > ] >`\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> < [ < > ] > <<<answer>>>"
