    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses and brackets so that they are properly closed. The input sequence is `( ( { }`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first character is `(`, which is an open parenthesis. It needs a corresponding `)` to close it.\n2. The second character is another `(`, which also needs a `)` to close it.\n3. The third character is `{`, which is an open curly brace. It needs a corresponding `}` to close it.\n4. The fourth character is `}`, which closes the third character `{`.\n\nNow, we need to add the necessary closing characters to balance the sequence:\n\n- The first `(` needs a `)` to close it.\n- The second `(` also needs a `)` to close it.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be `( ( { } ) )`.\n\n<<<answer>>>(({}))<<<answer>>>"
