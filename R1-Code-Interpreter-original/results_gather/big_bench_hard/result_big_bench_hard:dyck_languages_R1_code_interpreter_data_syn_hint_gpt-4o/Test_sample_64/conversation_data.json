    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, parentheses `( )`, and angle brackets `< >`.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `[`: This is an opening square bracket, so we need a closing square bracket `]`.\n2. `<`: This is an opening angle bracket, so we need a closing angle bracket `>`.\n3. `(`: This is an opening parenthesis, so we need a closing parenthesis `)`.\n4. `<`: This is another opening angle bracket, so we need another closing angle bracket `>`.\n5. `<`: Another opening angle bracket, requiring a closing `>`.\n6. `>`: This closes the last opened angle bracket.\n7. `[`: This is an opening square bracket, so we need a closing square bracket `]`.\n8. `]`: This closes the last opened square bracket.\n9. `(`: This is an opening parenthesis, so we need a closing parenthesis `)`.\n10. `)`: This closes the last opened parenthesis.\n11. `>`: This closes the second last opened angle bracket.\n\nNow, let's determine the remaining brackets needed to close all the opened ones:\n\n- We have an unclosed square bracket `[`.\n- We have an unclosed angle bracket `<`.\n- We have an unclosed parenthesis `(`.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be completed with `] > )` to close all the opened brackets.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > ] > )`.\n\n<<<answer>>>[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > ] > )<<<answer>>>"
