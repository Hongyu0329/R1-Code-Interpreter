    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the sequence. The input sequence is:\n\n< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] )\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` is an opening angle bracket, so we need a closing `>`.\n2. `(` is an opening parenthesis, so we need a closing `)`.\n3. `[` is an opening square bracket, so we need a closing `]`.\n4. Another `[`, so we need another `]`.\n5. Another `[`, so we need another `]`.\n6. Another `[`, so we need another `]`.\n7. `(` is an opening parenthesis, and it is already closed by `)`.\n8. `]` closes the last `[`.\n9. `]` closes the second last `[`.\n10. `{` is an opening brace, so we need a closing `}`.\n11. `}` closes the `{`.\n12. `]` closes the third last `[`.\n13. `]` closes the fourth last `[`.\n14. `)` closes the `(`.\n\nNow, we need to close the initial `<` with a `>`.\n\nThe complete sequence should be:\n\n< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] ) >\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> < ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] ) > <<<answer>>>"
