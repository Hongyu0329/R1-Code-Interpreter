    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses and angle brackets are properly closed. The input sequence is: `( ( < >`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first character is `(`, which is an opening parenthesis. It needs a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`.\n2. The second character is another `(`, which also needs a closing parenthesis `)`.\n3. The third character is `<`, which is an opening angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n4. The fourth character is `>`, which is a closing angle bracket. This matches with the third character `<`.\n\nNow, let's close the remaining open parentheses:\n\n- We have two open parentheses `(` that need to be closed with two closing parentheses `)`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be: `( ( < > ) )`.\n\n<<<'( ( < > ) )'>>>"
