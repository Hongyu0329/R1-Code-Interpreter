    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is `< { ( ( )`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening bracket.\n2. `{` - This is an opening bracket.\n3. `(` - This is an opening bracket.\n4. `(` - This is an opening bracket.\n5. `)` - This is a closing bracket for the last `(`.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n1. The last opened bracket is `(`, so we need a `)` to close it.\n2. The next opened bracket is `{`, so we need a `}` to close it.\n3. The first opened bracket is `<`, so we need a `>` to close it.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows: `< { ( ( ) ) } >`.\n\n<<<answer>>>< { ( ( ) ) } ><<<answer>>>"
