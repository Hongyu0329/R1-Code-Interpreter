    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and balanced. The input sequence is:\n\n< ( ( ( < > ) ) ( { { } [ { } ] [ ] < ( ) > } ) )\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The sequence starts with `<`, which needs to be closed with `>`.\n2. The first `(` needs to be closed with `)`.\n3. The second `(` needs to be closed with `)`.\n4. The third `(` needs to be closed with `)`.\n5. The `< >` pair is already closed.\n6. The first `)` closes the third `(`.\n7. The second `)` closes the second `(`.\n8. The sequence continues with another `(`, which needs to be closed with `)`.\n9. The `{` needs to be closed with `}`.\n10. The next `{` needs to be closed with `}`.\n11. The `[` needs to be closed with `]`.\n12. The `{ }` pair is already closed.\n13. The `[` needs to be closed with `]`.\n14. The `< ( ) >` is already closed.\n15. The `}` closes the first `{`.\n16. The `)` closes the last `(`.\n17. Finally, the `)` closes the first `(`.\n\nThe sequence is already balanced and properly closed. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
