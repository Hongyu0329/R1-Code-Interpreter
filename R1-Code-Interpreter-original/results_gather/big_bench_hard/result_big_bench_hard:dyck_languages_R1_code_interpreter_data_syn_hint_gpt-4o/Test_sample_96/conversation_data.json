    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The given sequence is `< < { } >`. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `<` - Another opening angle bracket.\n3. `{` - An opening curly brace.\n4. `}` - A closing curly brace.\n5. `>` - A closing angle bracket.\n\nThe sequence starts with two opening angle brackets, followed by an opening and closing curly brace, and then a closing angle bracket. \n\nTo complete the sequence properly, we need to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Currently, we have:\n\n- Two opening angle brackets `< <`\n- One closing angle bracket `>`\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need one more closing angle bracket `>` to match the two opening angle brackets. \n\nThus, the completed sequence should be `< < { } > >`.\n\n<<<answer>>> < < { } > > <<<answer>>>"
