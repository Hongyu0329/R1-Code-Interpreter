    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is balanced. A balanced sequence of brackets means that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and they are properly nested.\n\nGiven the input: `{ { { } }`\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first character is `{`, which is an opening bracket.\n2. The second character is `{`, another opening bracket.\n3. The third character is `{`, yet another opening bracket.\n4. The fourth character is `}`, which closes the most recent opening bracket `{`.\n5. The sequence ends with `}`, which closes the next most recent opening bracket `{`.\n\nCurrently, we have two opening brackets `{` that are not closed. To balance the sequence, we need to add two closing brackets `}` at the end.\n\nThus, the complete balanced sequence should be: `{ { { } } } }`\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
