    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, angle brackets `<>`, and curly braces `{}`. \n\nThe input sequence is: `( ( ( ( [ [ < [ { { [ ] } } ] > ] ] ( ) ) )`\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. We have four opening parentheses `(`.\n2. We have two opening square brackets `[`.\n3. We have one opening angle bracket `<`.\n4. We have two opening curly braces `{`.\n5. We have one pair of square brackets `[ ]` which is already closed.\n6. We have two closing curly braces `}`.\n7. We have one closing angle bracket `>`.\n8. We have two closing square brackets `]`.\n9. We have one pair of parentheses `( )` which is already closed.\n10. We have four closing parentheses `)`.\n\nNow, let's match them:\n\n- The innermost pair is `[ ]`, which is already closed.\n- The next pair is `{ { [ ] } }`, which is correctly closed.\n- The next pair is `< [ { { [ ] } } ] >`, which is correctly closed.\n- The next pair is `[ < [ { { [ ] } } ] > ]`, which is correctly closed.\n- The next pair is `( )`, which is already closed.\n- Finally, the outermost pair is `( ( ( ( [ [ < [ { { [ ] } } ] > ] ] ( ) ) ) )`, which is correctly closed.\n\nThe sequence is already complete and correctly closed. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.\n\n<<<'( ( ( ( [ [ < [ { { [ ] } } ] > ] ] ( ) ) ) )'>>>"
