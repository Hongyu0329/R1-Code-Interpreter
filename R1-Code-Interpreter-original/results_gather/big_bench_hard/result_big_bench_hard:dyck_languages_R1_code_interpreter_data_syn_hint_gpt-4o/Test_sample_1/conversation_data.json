    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The sequence given is `< [ [`. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. `<` is an opening angle bracket, so it needs a closing `>`.\n2. `[` is an opening square bracket, so it needs a closing `]`.\n3. The second `[` is another opening square bracket, so it also needs a closing `]`.\n\nTo properly close all the brackets, we need to add the corresponding closing brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- The last opened bracket is `[`, so we close it with `]`.\n- The next opened bracket is `[`, so we close it with `]`.\n- The first opened bracket is `<`, so we close it with `>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is `< [ [ ] ] >`.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
