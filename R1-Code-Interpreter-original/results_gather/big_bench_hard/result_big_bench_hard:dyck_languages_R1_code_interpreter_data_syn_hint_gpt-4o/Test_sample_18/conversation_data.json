    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is:\n\n```\n( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) }\n```\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The first part `( ( ) )` is already balanced and closed properly.\n2. The next part `[ { ( < > ) }` needs to be checked and completed.\n\n- The square bracket `[` is opened but not closed.\n- The curly brace `{` is opened but not closed.\n- The parentheses `( < > )` are balanced and closed properly.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to close the curly brace and the square bracket. Therefore, the completed sequence should be:\n\n```\n( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) } ]\n```\n\nThis sequence is now balanced with all opening brackets having corresponding closing brackets.\n\n<<<'( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) } ]'>>>"
