    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is:\n\n\\[ < > \\] \\[ \\[ < > \\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The first part is \\[ < > \\], which is already balanced. The square brackets and angle brackets are properly opened and closed.\n\n2. The second part is \\[ \\[ < > \\]. Here, we have:\n   - An opening square bracket \\[\n   - Another opening square bracket \\[\n   - An opening angle bracket <\n   - A closing angle bracket >\n   - At this point, we need to close the two square brackets that were opened.\n\nTherefore, to complete the sequence, we need to add two closing square brackets \\] \\] at the end.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ < > \\] \\[ \\[ < > \\] \\]\n\nThis sequence is now balanced with all brackets properly opened and closed.\n\n<<<[ < > ] [ [ < > ] ]>>>"
