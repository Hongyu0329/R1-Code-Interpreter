    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. The input sequence is:\n\n\\[ \\{ \\langle ( ) \\rangle \\}\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The sequence starts with a square bracket `[`.\n2. Inside the square bracket, there is a curly brace `{`.\n3. Inside the curly brace, there is an angle bracket `<`.\n4. Inside the angle bracket, there is a pair of parentheses `()`.\n5. After the parentheses, the angle bracket is closed with `>`.\n6. After the angle bracket, the curly brace is closed with `}`.\n\nNow, the sequence should be closed with the square bracket `]` to ensure all the opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols.\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence with properly closed parentheses is:\n\n\\[ \\{ \\langle ( ) \\rangle \\} \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<'[ { < ( ) > } ]'>>>"
