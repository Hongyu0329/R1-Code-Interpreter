    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is \"< ( ( )\". \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. \"<\" - This is an opening angle bracket. We need a closing angle bracket \">\" to balance it.\n2. \"(\" - This is an opening parenthesis. We need a closing parenthesis \")\" to balance it.\n3. \"(\" - Another opening parenthesis. We need another closing parenthesis \")\" to balance it.\n4. \")\" - This is a closing parenthesis, which balances the second opening parenthesis.\n\nNow, we need to add the necessary closing brackets to balance the sequence:\n\n- We have one unmatched opening angle bracket \"<\", so we need to add a closing angle bracket \">\".\n- We have one unmatched opening parenthesis \"(\", so we need to add a closing parenthesis \")\".\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be \"< ( ( ) ) >\".\n\n<<<answer>>> < ( ( ) ) > <<<answer>>>"
