    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n< ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] ) )\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` is an opening bracket, so it needs a closing `>`.\n2. The first `(` needs a closing `)`.\n3. The second `(` also needs a closing `)`.\n4. The first `[` needs a closing `]`.\n5. The `(` inside the brackets needs a closing `)`.\n6. The second `[` needs a closing `]`.\n\nThe sequence is already partially closed, so we need to add the necessary closing brackets in the correct order:\n\n- The innermost `[` is already closed with `]`.\n- The innermost `(` is already closed with `)`.\n- The next `[` is already closed with `]`.\n- The first `(` is already closed with `)`.\n- The second `(` is already closed with `)`.\n\nNow, we need to close the outermost `<` with `>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n< ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] ) ) >\n\nThe sequence is now properly closed with all brackets matched.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
