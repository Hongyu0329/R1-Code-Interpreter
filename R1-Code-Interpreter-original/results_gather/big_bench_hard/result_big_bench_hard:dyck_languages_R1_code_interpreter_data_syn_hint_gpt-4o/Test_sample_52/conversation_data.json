    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is `< < ( < >`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `<` - Another opening angle bracket.\n3. `(` - An opening parenthesis.\n4. `<` - Another opening angle bracket.\n5. `>` - A closing angle bracket.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The sequence currently has three opening angle brackets (`<`) and one closing angle bracket (`>`), and one opening parenthesis (`(`) with no closing parenthesis.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to add:\n\n- Two closing angle brackets (`>`) to match the two unmatched opening angle brackets.\n- One closing parenthesis (`)`) to match the opening parenthesis.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be: `< < ( < > > )`.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
