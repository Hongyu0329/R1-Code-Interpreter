    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n`< { } [ [ ( ( < { < { [ ] } > } > ) )`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `>` to close it.\n2. `{` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `}` to close it.\n3. `}` - This closes the previous `{`.\n4. `[` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `]` to close it.\n5. `[` - This is another opening bracket, so we need another `]` to close it.\n6. `(` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `)` to close it.\n7. `(` - This is another opening bracket, so we need another `)` to close it.\n8. `<` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `>` to close it.\n9. `{` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `}` to close it.\n10. `<` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `>` to close it.\n11. `{` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `}` to close it.\n12. `[` - This is an opening bracket, so we need a corresponding `]` to close it.\n13. `]` - This closes the previous `[`.\n14. `}` - This closes the previous `{`.\n15. `>` - This closes the previous `<`.\n16. `}` - This closes the previous `{`.\n17. `>` - This closes the previous `<`.\n18. `)` - This closes the previous `(`.\n19. `)` - This closes the previous `(`.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the correct order:\n\n- The first `[` needs a `]`.\n- The second `[` needs a `]`.\n- The first `<` needs a `>`.\n\nThus, the complete sequence is:\n\n`< { } [ [ ( ( < { < { [ ] } > } > ) ) ] ] >`\n\n<<<answer>>>"
