    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses while ensuring that all are properly closed and nested. The input sequence is:\n\n< < { ( < ( ) > ) }\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `<` - Another opening angle bracket.\n3. `{` - An opening curly brace.\n4. `(` - An opening parenthesis.\n5. `<` - An opening angle bracket.\n6. `(` - An opening parenthesis.\n7. `)` - A closing parenthesis. This closes the last opened parenthesis.\n8. `>` - A closing angle bracket. This closes the last opened angle bracket.\n9. `)` - A closing parenthesis. This closes the parenthesis opened at step 4.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining opened brackets:\n\n- The curly brace `{` opened at step 3 needs to be closed with `}`.\n- The angle bracket `<` opened at step 2 needs to be closed with `>`.\n- The angle bracket `<` opened at step 1 needs to be closed with `>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n< < { ( < ( ) > ) } > >\n\nLet's output the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>> < < { ( < ( ) > ) } > > <<<answer>>>"
