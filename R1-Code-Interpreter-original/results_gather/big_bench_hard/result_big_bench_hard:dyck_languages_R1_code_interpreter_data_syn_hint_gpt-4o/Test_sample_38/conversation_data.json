    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. The sequence given is:\n\n- `{` is opened and closed with `}`\n- `<` is opened and closed with `>`\n- `{` is opened and closed with `}`\n- `<` is opened and closed with `>`\n- `(` is opened and needs to be closed with `)`\n\nThe sequence is already balanced except for the last opening parenthesis `(`, which needs a closing parenthesis `)`.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n`{ } < { } < > ( )`\n\n<<<answer>>> { } < { } < > ( ) <<<answer>>>"
