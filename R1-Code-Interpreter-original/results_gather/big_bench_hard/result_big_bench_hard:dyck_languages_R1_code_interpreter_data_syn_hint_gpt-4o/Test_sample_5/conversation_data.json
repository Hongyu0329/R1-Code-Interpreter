    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n```\n( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > }\n```\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. We start with an opening parenthesis `(`.\n2. Then we have an opening square bracket `[`.\n3. Another opening square bracket `[`.\n4. Another opening square bracket `[`.\n5. An opening curly brace `{`.\n6. A closing curly brace `}`.\n7. A closing square bracket `]`.\n8. A closing square bracket `]`.\n9. An opening curly brace `{`.\n10. An opening angle bracket `<`.\n11. An opening square bracket `[`.\n12. An opening angle bracket `<`.\n13. An opening square bracket `[`.\n14. An opening curly brace `{`.\n15. A closing curly brace `}`.\n16. A closing square bracket `]`.\n17. A closing angle bracket `>`.\n18. A closing square bracket `]`.\n19. A closing angle bracket `>`.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- The last opened bracket is `{`, so we need a `}`.\n- The next is `[`, so we need a `]`.\n- The next is `[`, so we need a `]`.\n- The first opened bracket is `(`, so we need a `)`.\n\nThus, the complete sequence with properly closed brackets is:\n\n```\n( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > } ] ] )\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
