    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } >\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first character is '(', which needs a corresponding ')'.\n2. The next character is '{', which needs a corresponding '}'.\n3. The next character is '}', which closes the previous '{'.\n4. The next character is '<', which needs a corresponding '>'.\n5. The next character is '>', which closes the previous '<'.\n6. The next character is '{', which needs a corresponding '}'.\n7. The next character is '<', which needs a corresponding '>'.\n8. The next character is '{', which needs a corresponding '}'.\n9. The next character is '(', which needs a corresponding ')'.\n10. The next character is '<', which needs a corresponding '>'.\n11. The next character is '>', which closes the previous '<'.\n12. The next character is ')', which closes the previous '('.\n13. The next character is '}', which closes the previous '{'.\n14. The next character is '>', which closes the previous '<'.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first '(' needs a ')'.\n- The first '{' needs a '}'.\n\nThus, the complete sequence with properly closed brackets is:\n\n( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > } )\n\n<<<answer>>>( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > } )<<<answer>>>"
