    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n`< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ]`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket. We need a closing `>` for this.\n2. `{` - This is an opening curly bracket. We need a closing `}` for this.\n3. `<` - Another opening angle bracket. We need a closing `>` for this.\n4. `[` - An opening square bracket. We need a closing `]` for this.\n5. `[` - Another opening square bracket. We need a closing `]` for this.\n6. `(` - An opening parenthesis. We need a closing `)` for this.\n7. `{ }` - This pair is already complete.\n8. `)` - This closes the opening parenthesis from step 6.\n9. `]` - This closes the second opening square bracket from step 5.\n10. `]` - This closes the first opening square bracket from step 4.\n11. `>` - This closes the second opening angle bracket from step 3.\n12. `}` - This closes the opening curly bracket from step 2.\n13. `>` - This closes the first opening angle bracket from step 1.\n\nThe complete sequence with all brackets properly closed is:\n\n`< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ] } >`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
