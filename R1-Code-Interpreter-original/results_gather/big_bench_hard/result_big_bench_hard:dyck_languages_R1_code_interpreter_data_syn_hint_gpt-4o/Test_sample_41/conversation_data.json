    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, braces, and angle brackets are properly closed and nested. The sequence given is:\n\nInput: ( [ [ { < > { } { } < < < < { } > > ( < ( ( ) ) [ ( [ ] ) ] > ) > > { } } [ < < > > ] < ( ) > ] ]\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. Start with `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n2. Next is `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n3. Another `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n4. `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n5. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n6. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n7. `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n8. `}`, which closes the previous `{`.\n9. `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n10. `}`, which closes the previous `{`.\n11. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n12. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n13. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n14. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n15. `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n16. `}`, which closes the previous `{`.\n17. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n18. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n19. `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n20. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n21. `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n22. `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n23. `)`, which closes the previous `(`.\n24. `)`, which closes the previous `(`.\n25. `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n26. `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n27. `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n28. `]`, which closes the previous `[`.\n29. `)`, which closes the previous `(`.\n30. `]`, which closes the previous `[`.\n31. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n32. `)`, which closes the previous `(`.\n33. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n34. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n35. `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n36. `}`, which closes the previous `{`.\n37. `}`, which closes the previous `{`.\n38. `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n39. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n40. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n41. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n42. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n43. `]`, which closes the previous `[`.\n44. `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n45. `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n46. `)`, which closes the previous `(`.\n47. `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n48. `]`, which closes the previous `[`.\n49. `]`, which closes the previous `[`.\n\nThe sequence is already complete and properly closed. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
