    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses and angle brackets such that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols, and the sequence is balanced.\n\nThe input sequence is: ( < < < >\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. We have one opening parenthesis `(`, which needs a closing parenthesis `)`.\n2. We have three opening angle brackets `<`, which need three closing angle brackets `>`.\n3. We have one closing angle bracket `>` already present.\n\nTo balance the sequence:\n\n- We need to add two more closing angle brackets `>` to balance the three opening angle brackets `<`.\n- We need to add one closing parenthesis `)` to balance the opening parenthesis `(`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be: ( < < < > > > )\n\nThe sequence is now balanced with all opening symbols having corresponding closing symbols.\n\n<<<'( < < < > > > )'>>>"
