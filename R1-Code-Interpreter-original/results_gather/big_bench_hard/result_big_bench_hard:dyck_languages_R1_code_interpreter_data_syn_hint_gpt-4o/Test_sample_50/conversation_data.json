    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n- `(`: This is an opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n- `<`: This is an opening angle bracket and needs a closing `>`.\n- `>`: This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the previous `<`.\n- `(`: This is another opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n- `[`: This is an opening square bracket and needs a closing `]`.\n- `(`: This is another opening parenthesis and needs a closing `)`.\n\nNow, let's determine the order in which these brackets should be closed:\n\n1. The last opened bracket is `(`, so it should be closed first with `)`.\n2. Next, the `[` should be closed with `]`.\n3. Then, the `(` should be closed with `)`.\n4. Finally, the first `(` should be closed with `)`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is: `( < > ( [ ( ) ] ) )`.\n\n<<<'( < > ( [ ( ) ] ) )'>>>"
