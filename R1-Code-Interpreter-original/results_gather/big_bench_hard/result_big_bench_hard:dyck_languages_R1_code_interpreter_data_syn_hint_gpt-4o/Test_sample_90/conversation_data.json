    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence provided is:\n\n```\n{ < ( [ ( ( [ < { ( { } ) } < < > > > ] ) ) ] ) >\n```\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. `{` is opened first, so it should be closed last.\n2. `<` is opened next, so it should be closed second to last.\n3. `(` is opened next, so it should be closed third to last.\n4. `[` is opened next, so it should be closed fourth to last.\n5. `(` is opened next, so it should be closed fifth to last.\n6. Another `(` is opened, so it should be closed sixth to last.\n7. `[` is opened, so it should be closed seventh to last.\n8. `<` is opened, so it should be closed eighth to last.\n9. `{` is opened, so it should be closed ninth to last.\n10. `(` is opened, so it should be closed tenth to last.\n11. `{` is opened, and it is closed immediately with `}`.\n12. `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n13. `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n14. `<` is opened, and it is closed immediately with `>`.\n15. Another `<` is opened, and it is closed immediately with `>`.\n16. Another `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n17. `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n18. `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n19. Another `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n20. `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n21. `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n22. `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n23. Finally, `}` is closed, matching the first opened `{`.\n\nThe sequence is already complete and properly closed. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
