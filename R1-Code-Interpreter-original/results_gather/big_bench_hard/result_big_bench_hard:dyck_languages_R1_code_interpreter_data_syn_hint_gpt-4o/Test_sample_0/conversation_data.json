    "To complete the sequence of brackets, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The input given is `[ [`, which means we have two opening brackets: one square bracket and one additional square bracket inside it.\n\nTo properly close these brackets, we need to add two closing square brackets. The sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n1. The first `[` needs a corresponding `]`.\n2. The second `[` also needs a corresponding `]`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be `[ [ ] ]`.\n\n<<<answer>>>[ [ ] ]<<<answer>>>"
