  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Janet noticed that she did not put oil in the machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Roles and Responsibilities:**\n   - Janet works in the maintenance department and is responsible for greasing and oiling all machines in the factory. It is explicitly stated that it is her responsibility to put oil into the machines.\n   - Kate works in the human resources department. Although she knows how to grease and oil the machines, it is not her responsibility to do so if Janet fails to put oil in the machines.\n\n2. **Event Sequence:**\n   - Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine.\n   - Janet notices her mistake but does not take action to correct it.\n   - Kate does not notice Janet's mistake and does not put oil in the machine either.\n   - A few days later, the machine breaks down.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis:**\n   - The breakdown of the machine is directly linked to the lack of oil, which is a maintenance task.\n   - Janet, being responsible for oiling the machines, failed to perform her duty, which directly led to the machine not being oiled.\n   - Since it was Janet's responsibility to oil the machine, her failure to do so is the direct cause of the machine's breakdown.\n   - Kate's role and actions are irrelevant to the causation because it was not her responsibility to oil the machine.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The breakdown of the machine is a direct consequence of Janet not fulfilling her responsibility to oil it. Therefore, Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down.\n\nBased on this analysis, the typical person would conclude that Janet's failure to oil the machine caused it to break down.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
