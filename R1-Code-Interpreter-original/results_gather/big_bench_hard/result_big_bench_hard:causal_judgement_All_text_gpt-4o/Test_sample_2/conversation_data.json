  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLong ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question of causation regarding John's death, we need to consider the sequence of events and the definitions of causation:\n\n1. **Background Information**: John worked in a plastics division where he was exposed to asbestos, leading to a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer. He was given a prognosis of no more than 2 months to live.\n\n2. **Event of Interest**: John was administered the wrong medication by a nurse, which led to an allergic reaction, cardiac arrest, and his immediate death.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Proximate Cause**: The immediate cause of John's death was the administration of the wrong medication, which led to an allergic reaction and cardiac arrest.\n   - **Underlying Condition**: John had terminal lung cancer, which was expected to cause his death within a short period (2 months).\n   - **Legal and Philosophical Considerations**: In legal and philosophical terms, causation often considers whether an event (wrong medication) was a \"but-for\" cause of the outcome (death). In this case, but for the administration of the wrong medication, John would not have died at that specific time and manner, although he was expected to die soon due to cancer.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: While John's death was imminent due to cancer, the immediate cause of his death was the misadministration of medication. Therefore, in terms of proximate causation, the medication error caused his premature death.\n\nBased on this analysis, the typical answer to the question of whether the misadministration of medication caused John's premature death would be:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
