    "To determine whether the administrative assistant caused the problem, we need to analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: The problem is that the receptionist needs to take an important message but finds no pens left on her desk.\n\n2. **Understand the Context**: \n   - The receptionist keeps her desk stocked with pens.\n   - Administrative assistants are allowed to take pens.\n   - Faculty members are not supposed to take pens but do so anyway.\n   - The receptionist has reminded faculty members not to take pens.\n\n3. **Events Leading to the Problem**:\n   - On Monday morning, both an administrative assistant and Professor Smith (a faculty member) take pens from the receptionist's desk.\n\n4. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - The administrative assistant is allowed to take pens, so their action is within the rules.\n   - Professor Smith, a faculty member, is not allowed to take pens, so their action is against the rules.\n   - The problem arises because there are no pens left when the receptionist needs one.\n\n5. **Determine Responsibility**:\n   - Since the administrative assistant is permitted to take pens, their action is not a violation of the rules.\n   - Professor Smith's action is a violation and contributes to the depletion of pens.\n   - The problem of no pens being available is more directly linked to the unauthorized action of Professor Smith, who is not supposed to take pens.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The administrative assistant's action is not the cause of the problem because they are allowed to take pens.\n   - The problem is more directly caused by the faculty member's unauthorized action.\n\nBased on this analysis, the administrative assistant did not cause the problem.\n\n<<<No>>>"
