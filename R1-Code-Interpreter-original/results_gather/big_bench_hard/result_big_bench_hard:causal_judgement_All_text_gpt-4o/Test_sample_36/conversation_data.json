  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nA bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog knew about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: \n   - A bear and a hedgehog are shown a box full of colored pencils.\n   - Only bears are allowed to take pencils; hedgehogs are not.\n   - The hedgehog was present when this rule was announced, so it knew about the restriction.\n\n2. **Sequence of Events**:\n   - Both the bear and the hedgehog alternately took pencils from the box six times.\n   - Finally, both the hedgehog and the bear took a pencil simultaneously.\n\n3. **Outcome**:\n   - A polar bear later approaches the box to get a pencil for homework but finds the box empty.\n\n4. **Question of Causation**:\n   - Did the hedgehog cause the problem of the polar bear not being able to finish his homework?\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The rule clearly states that only bears are allowed to take pencils, and the hedgehog was aware of this rule.\n- Despite knowing the rule, the hedgehog took pencils, contributing to the depletion of the pencil supply.\n- The simultaneous action of both the bear and the hedgehog taking the last pencils directly led to the box being empty when the polar bear needed a pencil.\n- The hedgehog's action of taking pencils, despite the rule, directly contributed to the lack of pencils for the polar bear.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The hedgehog's actions were against the established rule and directly contributed to the problem of the polar bear not having a pencil.\n- Therefore, the hedgehog did cause the problem.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>."
