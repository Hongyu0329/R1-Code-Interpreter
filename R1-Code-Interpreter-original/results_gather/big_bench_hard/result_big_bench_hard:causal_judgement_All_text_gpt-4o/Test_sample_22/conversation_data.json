  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Roles and Responsibilities:**\n   - Janet works in the maintenance department and is responsible for oiling the machines.\n   - Kate works in the human resources department and, although she knows how to oil the machines, it is not her responsibility to do so if Janet fails to oil them.\n\n2. **Event Sequence:**\n   - Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine.\n   - Kate notices that Janet did not put oil in the machine but does not take action to oil it herself.\n   - The machine breaks down a few days later.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis:**\n   - The primary responsibility for oiling the machines lies with Janet. Her failure to oil the machine is a direct cause of the machine's breakdown.\n   - Kate's role is not to oil the machines unless it is her responsibility, which it is not in this scenario.\n   - The breakdown of the machine is a consequence of Janet's failure to perform her duty, not Kate's inaction.\n\n4. **Question of Causation:**\n   - The question asks if Kate not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down.\n   - Since it was not Kate's responsibility to oil the machine, her inaction cannot be considered a cause of the breakdown.\n   - The breakdown is directly linked to Janet's failure to oil the machine, not Kate's decision not to intervene.\n\nBased on this analysis, the typical person would conclude that Kate not putting oil in the machine did not cause it to break down. The causation lies with Janet's failure to fulfill her responsibility.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<No>>>"
