  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJoe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the neighbor cause injury to Joe's son?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question about causation, we need to consider the sequence of events and the role of each party involved:\n\n1. **Joe's Actions**: Joe was delayed in picking up his son because he stopped to talk with friends. This delay is attributed to Joe's talkative nature, which is described as a fundamental trait of his personality.\n\n2. **Neighbor's Actions**: Due to Joe's delay, the neighbor decided to take Joe's son home. The neighbor waited for 15 minutes before making this decision, indicating a willingness to help and a sense of responsibility.\n\n3. **Accident**: On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver, resulting in severe leg injuries to Joe's son.\n\n4. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Direct Cause**: The direct cause of the injury was the car accident, specifically the actions of the drunk driver who struck the neighbor's car.\n   - **Neighbor's Role**: The neighbor's decision to take Joe's son home was a response to Joe's delay. However, the neighbor did not cause the accident; the drunk driver did.\n   - **Joe's Role**: Joe's delay indirectly led to the neighbor taking his son home, but Joe did not cause the accident either.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The question asks if the neighbor caused the injury. While the neighbor was involved in the sequence of events leading to the injury, the neighbor did not cause the accident. The causation of the injury is directly linked to the drunk driver's actions.\n\nTherefore, the typical person would likely conclude that the neighbor did not cause the injury to Joe's son.\n\n<<<No>>>"
