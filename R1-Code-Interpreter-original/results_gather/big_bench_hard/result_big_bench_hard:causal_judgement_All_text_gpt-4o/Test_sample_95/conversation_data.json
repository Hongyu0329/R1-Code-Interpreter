  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Jane logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Lauren decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To analyze whether Jane caused the computer to crash, we need to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Understanding the Scenario**: \n   - Jane and Lauren work for the same company and need to use a computer.\n   - The computer crashes if two people are logged on simultaneously.\n   - The company policy allows Jane to use the computer in the morning and Lauren in the afternoon.\n\n2. **Sequence of Events**:\n   - Jane logs on at 9:00 am, which is in accordance with the company policy.\n   - Lauren logs on at 9:00 am, which is against the company policy.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - Causation typically involves an action that directly leads to an effect.\n   - Jane logging on alone would not cause the computer to crash.\n   - The crash occurs because both Jane and Lauren are logged on simultaneously.\n\n4. **Responsibility and Policy**:\n   - Jane followed the company policy by logging on in the morning.\n   - Lauren disobeyed the policy by logging on at the same time as Jane.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The crash was caused by the simultaneous login of both Jane and Lauren.\n   - Since Jane was following the policy and her action alone would not have caused the crash, she is not the cause of the crash.\n\nBased on this analysis, the typical person would conclude that Jane did not cause the computer to crash.\n\nFinal answer: <<<No>>>"
