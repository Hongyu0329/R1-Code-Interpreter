  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Alice also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Zoe caused the empty email to be sent, we need to analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Mechanism**: The central computer sends an empty email to a non-existent email address if two people are logged in simultaneously. This is an automatic process triggered by simultaneous logins.\n\n2. **Company Policy**: The company policy is that Alice is allowed to log in during the mornings, and Zoe is allowed to log in during the afternoons. This policy is in place to ensure that one person is always available to answer phone calls.\n\n3. **Violation of Policy**: On the day in question, Zoe logs in at 9 am, which is a violation of the company policy since it is morning and only Alice is supposed to log in during this time.\n\n4. **Simultaneous Login**: Alice also logs in at 9 am, which means both Alice and Zoe are logged in at the same time.\n\n5. **Triggering the Email**: The simultaneous login of Alice and Zoe triggers the central computer to send an empty email to a non-existent email address.\n\n6. **Causation Analysis**: \n   - Zoe's login is a necessary condition for the email to be sent because if she had not logged in, there would not have been two simultaneous logins, and the email would not have been sent.\n   - Alice's login is also a necessary condition for the email to be sent for the same reason.\n   - Both Alice and Zoe's actions are jointly sufficient to cause the email to be sent.\n\n7. **Responsibility and Causation**: \n   - From a causation perspective, both Alice and Zoe are responsible for the email being sent because both their actions were necessary for the event to occur.\n   - However, the question specifically asks if Zoe caused the email to be sent. Since Zoe's action was a necessary part of the condition that led to the email being sent, she did indeed cause the email to be sent.\n\nBased on this analysis, the typical person would conclude that Zoe did cause the empty email to be sent because her action was a necessary part of the condition that triggered the email.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
