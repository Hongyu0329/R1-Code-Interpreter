  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the roles and responsibilities:**\n   - Janet works in the maintenance department and is responsible for oiling the machines.\n   - Kate works in the human resources department and knows how to oil the machines but is not responsible for doing so if Janet fails to.\n\n2. **Understand the sequence of events:**\n   - Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine.\n   - Kate does not notice Janet's oversight and does not oil the machine either.\n   - The machine breaks down a few days later.\n\n3. **Determine the cause of the machine breakdown:**\n   - The machine requires oil to function properly.\n   - Janet, who is responsible for oiling the machine, did not perform her duty.\n   - Kate, although knowledgeable, is not responsible for oiling the machine in Janet's absence.\n\n4. **Evaluate causation:**\n   - The breakdown of the machine can be directly linked to the lack of oil, which was Janet's responsibility.\n   - Since Janet did not fulfill her responsibility, her failure to oil the machine is the direct cause of the breakdown.\n\n5. **Consider the options:**\n   - The question asks if Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down.\n   - Based on the analysis, Janet's failure to oil the machine is indeed the cause of the breakdown.\n\nTherefore, the typical person would conclude that Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>."
