  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation:**\n   - Alice and Zoe work for the same company but in different rooms.\n   - Both need to access the central computer occasionally.\n   - There is a hidden rule: if two people log in to the central computer simultaneously, an empty email is sent to a non-existent email address.\n\n2. **Sequence of Events:**\n   - Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am.\n   - Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am.\n   - Immediately after both are logged in, an empty email is sent.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis:**\n   - The causation rule is that the simultaneous login of two people triggers the email.\n   - Alice logging in alone does not cause the email to be sent.\n   - Zoe logging in alone does not cause the email to be sent.\n   - The email is sent only when both are logged in at the same time.\n\n4. **Evaluating Zoe's Role:**\n   - Zoe's login is a necessary condition for the email to be sent because without her login, the condition of two simultaneous logins would not be met.\n   - Therefore, Zoe's action of logging in at the same time as Alice is a contributing factor to the email being sent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Zoe's login is part of the condition that causes the email to be sent, a typical person would conclude that Zoe did cause the email to be sent, as her action was necessary for the condition to be fulfilled.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
