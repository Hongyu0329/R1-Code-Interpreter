    "To analyze the question about causation and determine whether Frank T. intentionally shot his neighbor, we need to consider several points:\n\n1. **Understanding Intentionality**: Intentionality in this context refers to whether Frank T. had the purpose or intention to shoot his neighbor. This involves examining his actions and the circumstances surrounding the event.\n\n2. **Ongoing Dispute**: The question states that Frank T. had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land. This provides a potential motive for his actions, suggesting that the shooting was not accidental.\n\n3. **Expert Marksman**: Frank T. is described as an expert marksman. This implies that he has the skill and ability to accurately hit a target. His expertise reduces the likelihood of the shooting being accidental.\n\n4. **Action of Pulling the Trigger**: Frank T. made the conscious decision to pull the trigger. This deliberate action indicates a level of intent, as pulling the trigger is a purposeful act.\n\n5. **Direct Hit to the Body**: The fact that Frank T. directly hit his neighbor's body further supports the idea that the shooting was intentional. An expert marksman would likely be able to control where they aim and shoot.\n\n6. **Significant Injury**: The result of the shooting was significant injury to the neighbor. This outcome aligns with the notion that Frank T. intended to cause harm, given the context of the dispute and his actions.\n\nConsidering these points, a typical person would likely conclude that Frank T. intentionally shot his neighbor, given the motive, his expertise, and the deliberate nature of his actions.\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes"
