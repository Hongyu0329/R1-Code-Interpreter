    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario and the statements provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Scenario:**\n   - Claire's parents bought her an old computer.\n   - Claire uses the computer for schoolwork.\n   - Daniel, Claire's brother, sometimes uses the computer to play games.\n   - Claire has warned Daniel that if they are both logged on at the same time, the computer will crash.\n\n2. **Event Occurrence:**\n   - One day, both Claire and Daniel logged on to the computer simultaneously.\n   - The computer crashed as a result.\n\n3. **Repairman's Statement:**\n   - The repairman acknowledges that Daniel was logged on.\n   - He states that the computer will only crash if two people are logged on at the same time.\n   - He expresses confusion about why the computer crashed, implying he might not be aware that Claire was also logged on.\n\n4. **Causation Analysis:**\n   - Claire's statement to Daniel indicates a causal relationship: simultaneous logins by two users will cause the computer to crash.\n   - The crash occurred when both Claire and Daniel were logged on, fulfilling the condition Claire warned about.\n   - The repairmanâ€™s statement supports this causation by confirming that the crash condition is two simultaneous logins.\n\n5. **Determining Daniel's Role:**\n   - Daniel logging on was a necessary condition for the crash, as per Claire's warning.\n   - However, the crash was not solely caused by Daniel; it required both Claire and Daniel to be logged on.\n   - Therefore, Daniel's action was a contributing factor, but not the sole cause.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question asks if Daniel caused the crash. While Daniel's action was necessary for the crash, it was not sufficient on its own. Both Claire and Daniel logging on together caused the crash.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether Daniel caused the computer crash is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
