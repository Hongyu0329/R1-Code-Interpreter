    "To analyze the question about causation, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation:**\n   - Claire's parents bought her an old computer.\n   - Claire uses the computer for schoolwork.\n   - Daniel, Claire's brother, sometimes uses the computer to play games.\n   - Claire has warned Daniel not to log on at the same time as her because it will cause the computer to crash.\n\n2. **Event Occurrence:**\n   - One day, both Claire and Daniel logged on to the computer simultaneously.\n   - As a result, the computer crashed.\n\n3. **Repairman's Observation:**\n   - The repairman notes that the computer will only crash if two people are logged on at the same time.\n   - He observes that Daniel was logged on but is unsure why the computer crashed.\n\n4. **Causation Analysis:**\n   - The condition for the computer to crash is that two people must be logged on simultaneously.\n   - Claire was one of the two people logged on when the crash occurred.\n   - Therefore, Claire's action of logging on contributed to the condition that caused the crash.\n\n5. **Determining Causation:**\n   - Causation in this context is about whether Claire's actions were a necessary part of the condition that led to the crash.\n   - Since the crash only occurs when two people are logged on, and Claire was one of those people, her action is part of the cause.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Claire's action of logging on, combined with Daniel's action, directly led to the computer crashing.\n   - Therefore, Claire did cause the computer crash, as her action was necessary for the crash to occur.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question \"Did Claire cause the computer crash?\" is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
