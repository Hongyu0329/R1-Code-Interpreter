  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nSuzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells Suzy: \"Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time.\" Then he tells Billy: \"Be sure that you do not come in at all tomorrow morning. It is absolutely essential that you not appear at that time.\" Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, we need to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Understanding the Scenario**: \n   - Suzy and Billy are working on a project important for national security.\n   - Suzy is instructed to arrive at exactly 9 am.\n   - Billy is instructed not to come in at all in the morning.\n   - Both arrive at 9 am, triggering a motion detector.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - The motion detector is triggered if at least one person is present.\n   - Suzy's presence alone would have been sufficient to trigger the detector.\n   - Billy's presence is not necessary for the detector to be triggered since Suzy was already there.\n\n3. **Counterfactual Consideration**:\n   - If Billy had not arrived, the motion detector would still have gone off because Suzy was present.\n   - Therefore, Billy's presence is not a necessary condition for the detector to be triggered.\n\n4. **Causation Definition**:\n   - In typical causation analysis, an event is considered a cause if it is necessary for the outcome.\n   - Since the outcome (motion detector going off) would have occurred without Billy, he is not a cause.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, Billy did not cause the motion detector to go off because his presence was not necessary for the detector to be triggered.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
