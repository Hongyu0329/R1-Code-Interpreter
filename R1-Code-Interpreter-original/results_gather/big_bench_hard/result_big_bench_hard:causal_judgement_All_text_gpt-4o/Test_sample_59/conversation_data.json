Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog does not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework.

    "To determine whether the hedgehog caused the problem, we need to analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Rule**: The rule is that only bears are allowed to take pencils. The hedgehog was not present when this rule was announced, so it is unaware of the restriction.\n\n2. **Actions Taken**: Both the bear and the hedgehog alternately took pencils from the box six times. This implies that both animals took three pencils each, assuming they alternated equally.\n\n3. **Simultaneous Action**: At the end, both the hedgehog and the bear took a pencil simultaneously, which means each took one more pencil, totaling four pencils each.\n\n4. **Resulting Situation**: After these actions, there were no pencils left in the box when the polar bear arrived.\n\n5. **Causation Analysis**: \n   - The hedgehog took pencils despite the rule, but it was unaware of the rule.\n   - The bear also took pencils, which was allowed by the rule.\n   - The simultaneous action of both the bear and the hedgehog taking the last pencils led to the box being empty.\n\n6. **Determining Responsibility**: \n   - The hedgehog's lack of knowledge about the rule is a key factor. It did not intentionally break the rule.\n   - The bear, following the rule, also contributed to the depletion of pencils.\n   - The problem (no pencils left for the polar bear) was caused by the combined actions of both the bear and the hedgehog.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since the hedgehog was unaware of the rule and both animals contributed equally to the depletion of pencils, it is not solely responsible for the problem. The situation was a result of both animals' actions.\n\nTherefore, the hedgehog did not cause the problem on its own.\n\n<<<No>>>"
