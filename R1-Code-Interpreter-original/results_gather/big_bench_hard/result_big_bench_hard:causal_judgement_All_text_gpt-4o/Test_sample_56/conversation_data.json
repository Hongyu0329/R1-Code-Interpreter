Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the roles and responsibilities:**\n   - Janet works in the maintenance department and is responsible for oiling the machines.\n   - Kate works in the human resources department and, although she knows how to oil the machines, it is not her responsibility to do so if Janet fails to.\n\n2. **Understand the sequence of events:**\n   - Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine.\n   - Kate notices that Janet did not oil the machine but does not take action to oil it herself.\n   - The machine breaks down a few days later.\n\n3. **Determine the cause of the machine breakdown:**\n   - The machine requires oil to function properly. Janet, who is responsible for oiling the machine, did not fulfill her duty.\n   - Kate, although aware of the situation, is not responsible for oiling the machine, so her inaction is not a breach of duty.\n\n4. **Assess causation:**\n   - The breakdown of the machine can be directly linked to the lack of oil, which was Janet's responsibility to provide.\n   - Since Janet did not oil the machine, and this lack of oiling is a necessary condition for the machine's proper functioning, her failure to act is the direct cause of the breakdown.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information provided, Janet's failure to oil the machine is the direct cause of the machine's breakdown.\n\nTherefore, the typical person would conclude that Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
