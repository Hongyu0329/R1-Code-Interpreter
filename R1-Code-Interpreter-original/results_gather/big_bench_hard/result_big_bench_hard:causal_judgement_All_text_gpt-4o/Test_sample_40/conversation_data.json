  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nDrew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers at a small, local coffee shop. Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Kylie, Oliver, and Jen all usually order coffee on Tuesdays. However, Drew doesn't usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, unexpectedly, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, Oliver ordered coffee, and Jen also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day. Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: \n   - The coffee shop turns a profit if at least one person orders coffee on a given day.\n   - On Tuesdays, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen usually order coffee, ensuring the shop makes a profit.\n   - Drew does not usually order coffee on Tuesdays.\n\n2. **Events on This Specific Tuesday**:\n   - Drew unexpectedly ordered coffee.\n   - Kylie, Oliver, and Jen also ordered coffee as they usually do.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if Drew ordering coffee caused the shop to make a profit.\n   - For causation, Drew's action would need to be necessary for the outcome (profit) to occur.\n   - Since Kylie, Oliver, and Jen also ordered coffee, the shop would have made a profit regardless of Drew's order.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Drew's order was not necessary for the shop to make a profit because the other three customers also ordered coffee, which is sufficient for profit.\n   - Therefore, Drew ordering coffee did not cause the shop to make a profit; it would have happened anyway.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
