  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLong ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did long-term exposure to asbestos cause John's premature death?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question about causation, we need to consider the sequence of events and the role of each factor in John's death.\n\n1. **Background Information**: \n   - John worked in the plastics division for 30 years and was exposed to asbestos, a known carcinogen.\n   - He developed a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer, attributed to asbestos exposure.\n   - Doctors confirmed that his cancer was untreatable and he was expected to die from it within two months.\n\n2. **Immediate Cause of Death**:\n   - John died from cardiac arrest after being administered the wrong medication to which he was allergic.\n   - This event was accidental and unrelated to his cancer or asbestos exposure.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Asbestos Exposure**: This was a significant factor in John's development of lung cancer, which was expected to cause his death soon.\n   - **Wrong Medication**: This was the direct and immediate cause of John's death, as it led to an allergic reaction and cardiac arrest.\n\n4. **Determining Causation**:\n   - The question asks if long-term exposure to asbestos caused John's premature death.\n   - While asbestos exposure caused the lung cancer, it was not the direct cause of his death. The immediate cause was the administration of the wrong medication.\n   - Therefore, while asbestos exposure was a significant factor in his overall health decline, it was not the direct cause of his death.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
