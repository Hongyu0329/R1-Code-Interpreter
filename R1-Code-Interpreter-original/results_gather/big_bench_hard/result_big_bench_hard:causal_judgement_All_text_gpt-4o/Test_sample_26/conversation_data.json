  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario and the causation question step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Roles and Responsibilities:**\n   - Janet works in the maintenance department and is responsible for oiling the machines.\n   - Kate works in the human resources department and, although she knows how to oil the machines, it is not her responsibility to do so if Janet fails to oil them.\n\n2. **Event Sequence:**\n   - Janet forgets to oil an important machine.\n   - Kate does not notice Janet's oversight and does not oil the machine either.\n   - The machine breaks down a few days later.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis:**\n   - The primary responsibility for oiling the machines lies with Janet. Her failure to oil the machine is a direct cause of the machine's breakdown.\n   - Kate's role does not include the responsibility to oil the machines, even though she has the knowledge to do so. Therefore, her inaction is not a breach of duty or responsibility.\n   - Causation typically involves a breach of duty or responsibility leading to an outcome. Since Kate had no duty to oil the machine, her not oiling it cannot be considered a cause of the breakdown.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The breakdown of the machine is directly linked to Janet's failure to perform her duty, not Kate's inaction.\n   - Therefore, Kate not putting oil in the machine did not cause it to break down.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
