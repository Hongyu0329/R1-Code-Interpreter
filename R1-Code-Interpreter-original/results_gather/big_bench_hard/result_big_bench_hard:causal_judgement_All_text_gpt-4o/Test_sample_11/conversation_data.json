    "To analyze the question, let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: \n   - The coffee shop turns a profit if at least one person orders coffee on a given day.\n   - Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers.\n   - On Tuesdays, Kylie and Oliver usually order coffee, while Drew does not.\n\n2. **Events on This Tuesday**:\n   - Drew unexpectedly ordered coffee.\n   - Kylie ordered coffee.\n   - Oliver ordered coffee.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - The coffee shop needs at least one person to order coffee to make a profit.\n   - On this Tuesday, three people ordered coffee: Drew, Kylie, and Oliver.\n   - Since Kylie and Oliver usually order coffee on Tuesdays, the coffee shop would have made a profit even if Drew had not ordered coffee.\n\n4. **Causation Question**:\n   - The question asks if Drew ordering coffee caused the coffee shop to make a profit.\n   - Since Kylie and Oliver's orders were sufficient for the coffee shop to make a profit, Drew's order was not necessary for the profit to occur.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Drew's order did not cause the coffee shop to make a profit because the profit would have occurred regardless of his order due to Kylie and Oliver's orders.\n\nBased on this analysis, the typical person would conclude that Drew ordering coffee did not cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day.\n\n<<<No>>>"
