    "To determine how many penguins are in the tables, we need to count the number of lines in the penguin table, excluding the header. The penguin table is as follows:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nBernard, 5, 80, 13\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nThe first line is the header, and the subsequent lines represent individual penguins. Let's count these lines to find the number of penguins.\n\n```python\n# Define the penguin data as a list of strings, each representing a line in the table\npenguin_data = [\n    \"name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\",\n    \"Louis, 7, 50, 11\",\n    \"Bernard, 5, 80, 13\",\n    \"Vincent, 9, 60, 11\",\n    \"Gwen, 8, 70, 15\"\n]\n\n# Count the number of penguins by subtracting 1 for the header\nnumber_of_penguins = len(penguin_data) - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(number_of_penguins)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the number of penguins in the table.",
    "The code execution confirms that there are 4 penguins in the table. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n<<<D) 4>>>"
