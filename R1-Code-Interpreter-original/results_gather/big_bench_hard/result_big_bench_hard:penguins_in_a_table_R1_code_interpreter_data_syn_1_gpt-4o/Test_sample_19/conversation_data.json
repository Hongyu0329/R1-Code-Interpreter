    "To determine the youngest penguin, we need to analyze the given data and identify the penguin with the smallest age value. The table provided is:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nBernard, 5, 80, 13\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nHowever, we are instructed to delete Bernard from the table. After removing Bernard, the table becomes:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the penguin with the smallest age from the remaining entries. Let's write a Python script to determine this.\n\n```python\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7, \"height\": 50, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9, \"height\": 60, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8, \"height\": 70, \"weight\": 15}\n]\n\nyoungest_penguin = min(penguins, key=lambda x: x[\"age\"])\nprint(youngest_penguin[\"name\"])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will help us find the youngest penguin.",
    "The code execution indicates that the youngest penguin, after removing Bernard from the list, is Louis. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
