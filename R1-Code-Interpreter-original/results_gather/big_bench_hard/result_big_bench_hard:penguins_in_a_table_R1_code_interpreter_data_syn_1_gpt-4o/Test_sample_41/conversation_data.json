    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are left in the table after deleting Bernard.\n\nInitially, the table contains the following penguins:\n\n1. Louis\n2. Bernard\n3. Vincent\n4. Gwen\n\nThe problem states that Bernard is deleted from the table. Therefore, we need to remove Bernard from the list of penguins.\n\nLet's calculate the number of penguins remaining after Bernard is removed.\n\n```python\n# Initial list of penguins\npenguins = [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\"]\n\n# Remove Bernard from the list\npenguins.remove(\"Bernard\")\n\n# Count the remaining penguins\nremaining_penguins = len(penguins)\n\n# Output the number of remaining penguins\nprint(remaining_penguins)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will know how many penguins are left in the table. Let's see the result.",
    "The code execution output indicates that there are 3 penguins remaining in the table after Bernard is removed. \n\nInitially, there were 4 penguins: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. After removing Bernard, we are left with Louis, Vincent, and Gwen.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins listed in the table is 3.\n\n<<<C) 3>>>"
