    "To find the cumulated age of the penguins and giraffes, we need to sum up the ages of all the penguins and giraffes listed in the tables.\n\nFirst, let's list the ages of the penguins:\n- Louis: 7\n- Bernard: 5\n- Vincent: 9\n- Gwen: 8\n\nNow, let's list the ages of the giraffes:\n- Jody: 5\n- Gladys: 10\n- Marian: 2\n- Donna: 9\n\nNext, we will calculate the total age by summing these values.\n\n```python\n# Ages of penguins\npenguin_ages = [7, 5, 9, 8]\n\n# Ages of giraffes\ngiraffe_ages = [5, 10, 2, 9]\n\n# Calculate the total age\ntotal_age = sum(penguin_ages) + sum(giraffe_ages)\n\n# Output the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the total cumulated age of the penguins and giraffes.",
    "The cumulated age of the penguins and giraffes is 55. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
