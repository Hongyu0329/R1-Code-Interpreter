    "To find the cumulated age of the penguins, we need to sum the ages of all the penguins listed in the table, including the newly added penguin, James.\n\nThe ages of the penguins are as follows:\n- Louis: 7 years\n- Bernard: 5 years\n- Vincent: 9 years\n- Gwen: 8 years\n- James: 12 years\n\nWe will sum these ages to find the total.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Ages of the penguins\nages = [7, 5, 9, 8, 12]\n\n# Calculate the sum of ages\ntotal_age = sum(ages)\n\n# Print the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the cumulated age.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the cumulated age of the penguins as 41. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<D) 41>>>"
