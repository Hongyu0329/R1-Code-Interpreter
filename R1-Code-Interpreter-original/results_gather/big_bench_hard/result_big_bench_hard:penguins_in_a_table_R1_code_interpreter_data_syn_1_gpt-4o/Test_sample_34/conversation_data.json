    "To determine how many species are listed in the table, we need to analyze the data provided. The table includes the following penguins:\n\n1. Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n2. Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n3. Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n4. Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\nThe table provides information about individual penguins, but it does not specify the species of each penguin. Since there is no explicit mention of different species, we can assume that all the penguins belong to the same species unless stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, it is reasonable to conclude that there is only one species listed in the table.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
