  "question": "Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nAnd here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nJody, 5, 430, 620\nGladys, 10, 420, 590\nMarian, 2, 310, 410\nDonna, 9, 440, 650\nWhat is the name of the last animal?\nOptions:\n(A) Bernard\n(B) Donna\n(C) Gladys\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine the name of the last animal, we need to analyze the two tables provided: one for penguins and one for giraffes. The task is to identify the last entry in these tables.\n\n1. **Penguin Table:**\n   - Louis, 7, 50, 11\n   - Bernard, 5, 80, 13\n   - Vincent, 9, 60, 11\n   - Gwen, 8, 70, 15\n   - James, 12, 90, 12\n\n   The last penguin added to the table is James.\n\n2. **Giraffe Table:**\n   - Jody, 5, 430, 620\n   - Gladys, 10, 420, 590\n   - Marian, 2, 310, 410\n   - Donna, 9, 440, 650\n\n   The last giraffe in the table is Donna.\n\nSince the question asks for the name of the last animal, we need to compare the last entries of both tables. The last entry in the penguin table is James, and the last entry in the giraffe table is Donna. Since the giraffe table is listed after the penguin table, the last animal overall is Donna.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B) Donna.\n\n<<<Donna>>>"
