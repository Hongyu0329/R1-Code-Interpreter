    "To determine the name of the last animal, we need to look at the tables provided for both penguins and giraffes. The last entry in the giraffe table is \"Donna,\" which is the last animal listed overall.\n\nLet's break down the tables:\n\n1. **Penguins Table:**\n   - Louis\n   - Bernard\n   - Vincent\n   - Gwen\n\n2. **Giraffes Table:**\n   - Jody\n   - Gladys\n   - Marian\n   - Donna\n\nThe last animal listed in the giraffes table is \"Donna.\" Therefore, the name of the last animal is \"Donna.\"\n\nNow, let's match this with the options provided:\n\n- (A) Bernard\n- (B) Donna\n- (C) Gladys\n- (D) Gwen\n- (E) James\n\nThe correct option is (B) Donna.\n\n<<<B) Donna>>>"
