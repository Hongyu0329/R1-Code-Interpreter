    "To determine how many species are listed in the tables, we need to identify the distinct species mentioned. \n\nFrom the provided tables, we have:\n1. Penguins: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, and James.\n2. Giraffes: Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna.\n\nThe tables list two distinct species: penguins and giraffes.\n\nTherefore, the number of species listed in the tables is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
