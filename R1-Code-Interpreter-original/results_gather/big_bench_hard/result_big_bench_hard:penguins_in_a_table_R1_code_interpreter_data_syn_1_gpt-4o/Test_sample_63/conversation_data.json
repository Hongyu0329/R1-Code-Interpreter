    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are less than 10 years old based on the given data. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old\n2. Bernard: 5 years old\n3. Vincent: 9 years old\n4. Gwen: 8 years old\n\nWe need to count the number of penguins whose age is less than 10. Let's write a simple Python script to count these penguins.\n\n```python\n# List of penguins with their ages\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7},\n    {\"name\": \"Bernard\", \"age\": 5},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8}\n]\n\n# Count penguins with age less than 10\ncount = sum(1 for penguin in penguins if penguin[\"age\"] < 10)\n\n# Output the count\nprint(count)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of penguins less than 10 years old.",
    "The code output indicates that there are 4 penguins who are less than 10 years old. This matches our expectations since all the penguins listed (Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen) have ages less than 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<(D) 4>>>"
