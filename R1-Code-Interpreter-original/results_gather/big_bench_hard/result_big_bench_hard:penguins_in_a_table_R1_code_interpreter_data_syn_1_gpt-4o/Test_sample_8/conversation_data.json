    "To determine how many penguins are in the table, we need to count the number of penguin entries. Initially, there are four penguins listed: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. We then add one more penguin, James, to the table. \n\nLet's calculate the total number of penguins:\n\n1. Louis\n2. Bernard\n3. Vincent\n4. Gwen\n5. James\n\nNow, let's write a simple Python script to count the number of penguins:\n\n```python\n# List of penguins\npenguins = [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\", \"James\"]\n\n# Count the number of penguins\nnumber_of_penguins = len(penguins)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_penguins)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total number of penguins in the table.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the correct output. The total number of penguins in the table is 5. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<E) 5>>>"
