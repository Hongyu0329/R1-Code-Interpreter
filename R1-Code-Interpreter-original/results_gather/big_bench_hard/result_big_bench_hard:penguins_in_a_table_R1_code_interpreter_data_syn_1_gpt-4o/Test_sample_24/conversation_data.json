    "To solve this problem, we need to extract the age of Bernard from the given table. The table provides the following information:\n\n- Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n- Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n- Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n- Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\nThe question asks for the age of Bernard. According to the table, Bernard's age is 5.\n\nNow, let's match this with the given options:\n\n(A) 7\n(B) 5\n(C) 9\n(D) 8\n(E) 12\n\nThe correct option is (B) 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
