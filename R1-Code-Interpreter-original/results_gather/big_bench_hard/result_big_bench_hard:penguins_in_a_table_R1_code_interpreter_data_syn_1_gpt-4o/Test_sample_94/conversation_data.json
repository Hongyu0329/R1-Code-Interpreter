    "To solve this problem, we need to first understand the data given and then perform the necessary operations to find the answer.\n\n1. We have a table of penguins with their names, ages, heights, and weights.\n2. The penguins are: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.\n3. We are instructed to delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n4. After removing Bernard, we need to sort the remaining penguins by their names in alphabetical order.\n5. Finally, we need to identify the last penguin in this sorted list.\n\nLet's proceed with the steps:\n\n- Start with the list of penguin names: [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\"]\n- Remove \"Bernard\" from the list.\n- Sort the remaining names alphabetically.\n- Identify the last name in the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial list of penguin names\npenguin_names = [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\"]\n\n# Remove Bernard from the list\npenguin_names.remove(\"Bernard\")\n\n# Sort the remaining names alphabetically\npenguin_names.sort()\n\n# Get the last name in the sorted list\nlast_penguin_name = penguin_names[-1]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(last_penguin_name)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the last penguin's name in alphabetical order.",
    "The code execution confirms that after removing Bernard and sorting the remaining penguin names alphabetically, the last name in the list is \"Vincent.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Vincent>>>"
