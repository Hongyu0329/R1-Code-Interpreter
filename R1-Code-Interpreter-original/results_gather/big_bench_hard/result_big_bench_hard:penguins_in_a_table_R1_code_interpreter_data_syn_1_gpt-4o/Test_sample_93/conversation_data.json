    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the last penguin in the list after Bernard is removed. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have a list of penguins with their respective details: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.\n2. The order of the penguins in the list is important: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen.\n3. We are instructed to delete Bernard from the list.\n4. After removing Bernard, the list will be: Louis, Vincent, Gwen.\n5. The last penguin in this updated list is Gwen.\n\nTherefore, the name of the last penguin after Bernard is removed is Gwen.\n\n<<<D) Gwen>>>"
