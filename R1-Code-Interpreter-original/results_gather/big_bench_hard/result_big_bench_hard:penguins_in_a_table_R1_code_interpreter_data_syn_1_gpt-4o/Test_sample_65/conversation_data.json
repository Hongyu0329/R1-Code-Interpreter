    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average height of the penguins after removing Bernard from the table. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Data**: We have the following penguins with their respective heights:\n   - Louis: 50 cm\n   - Bernard: 80 cm (to be removed)\n   - Vincent: 60 cm\n   - Gwen: 70 cm\n\n2. **Remove Bernard**: After removing Bernard, we are left with:\n   - Louis: 50 cm\n   - Vincent: 60 cm\n   - Gwen: 70 cm\n\n3. **Calculate Average Height**: We need to calculate the average height of the remaining penguins.\n\nThe formula for average height is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Height} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of Heights}}{\\text{Number of Penguins}}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Heights of the remaining penguins\nheights = [50, 60, 70]\n\n# Calculate the average height\naverage_height = sum(heights) / len(heights)\n\n# Print the average height\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the average height.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the average height of the penguins after removing Bernard. The calculated average height is 60.0 cm. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 60\n(B) 65\n(C) 70\n(D) 75\n(E) 80\n\nThe correct option that matches the calculated average height is (A) 60.\n\n<<<A>>>"
