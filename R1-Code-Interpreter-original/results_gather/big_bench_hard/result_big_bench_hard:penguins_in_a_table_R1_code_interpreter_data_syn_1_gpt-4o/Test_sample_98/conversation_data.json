    "To determine the oldest penguin, we need to compare the ages of the penguins listed in the table. Let's extract the relevant information:\n\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Bernard: 5 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n\nWe will write a simple Python script to find the penguin with the maximum age.\n\n```python\npenguins = {\n    \"Louis\": 7,\n    \"Bernard\": 5,\n    \"Vincent\": 9,\n    \"Gwen\": 8\n}\n\noldest_penguin = max(penguins, key=penguins.get)\nprint(oldest_penguin)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the name of the oldest penguin.",
    "The code execution output indicates that \"Vincent\" is the oldest penguin among the given options. \n\nBased on the options provided:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\n\nThe correct answer is option (C) Vincent.\n\n<<<C>>>"
