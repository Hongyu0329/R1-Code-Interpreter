  "question": "Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nWe then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\nWhat is the cumulated weight of the penguins?\nOptions:\n(A) 37\n(B) 49\n(C) 50\n(D) 62\n(E) 63\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the penguins after adding James and removing Bernard from the table. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Table of Penguins:**\n   - Louis: 11 kg\n   - Bernard: 13 kg\n   - Vincent: 11 kg\n   - Gwen: 15 kg\n\n2. **Add James to the Table:**\n   - James: 12 kg\n\n3. **Remove Bernard from the Table:**\n   - Remove Bernard's weight (13 kg) from the total.\n\n4. **Calculate the Cumulated Weight:**\n   - Sum the weights of the remaining penguins: Louis, Vincent, Gwen, and James.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial weights of the penguins\nweights = {\n    \"Louis\": 11,\n    \"Bernard\": 13,\n    \"Vincent\": 11,\n    \"Gwen\": 15,\n    \"James\": 12  # Added James\n}\n\n# Remove Bernard\nweights.pop(\"Bernard\")\n\n# Calculate the cumulated weight\ncumulated_weight = sum(weights.values())\n\nprint(cumulated_weight)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the cumulated weight.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the cumulated weight of the penguins after adding James and removing Bernard. The total weight is 49 kg.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
