    "To determine the number of columns in the table, we need to analyze the structure of the data provided. The table is described with a header and subsequent lines for each penguin, with each line containing the following information: name, age, height, and weight.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. **Header**: The header contains the column names: \"name\", \"age\", \"height (cm)\", and \"weight (kg)\".\n2. **Data Rows**: Each penguin's data is represented in a row with the following fields:\n   - Name (e.g., Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen)\n   - Age (e.g., 7, 5, 9, 8)\n   - Height (e.g., 50, 80, 60, 70)\n   - Weight (e.g., 11, 13, 11, 15)\n\nFrom this breakdown, we can see that there are four distinct pieces of information for each penguin, which correspond to four columns in the table.\n\nTherefore, the number of columns in the table is 4.\n\nThe correct option is (D) 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
