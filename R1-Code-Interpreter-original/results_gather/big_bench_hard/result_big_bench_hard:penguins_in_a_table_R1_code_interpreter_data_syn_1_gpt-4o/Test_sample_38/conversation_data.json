    "To determine how many giraffes are in the tables, we need to analyze the given data. The table for giraffes is clearly separated from the table for penguins. \n\nThe giraffe table is as follows:\n- Jody, 5, 430, 620\n- Gladys, 10, 420, 590\n- Marian, 2, 310, 410\n- Donna, 9, 440, 650\n\nWe can see that there are four entries in the giraffe table. Therefore, the number of giraffes is 4.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to count the number of giraffes in the table.\n\n```python\n# Define the giraffe data\ngiraffes = [\n    (\"Jody\", 5, 430, 620),\n    (\"Gladys\", 10, 420, 590),\n    (\"Marian\", 2, 310, 410),\n    (\"Donna\", 9, 440, 650)\n]\n\n# Count the number of giraffes\nnumber_of_giraffes = len(giraffes)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_giraffes)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the number of giraffes. \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer based on the analysis and the code execution.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The code execution confirms that there are 4 giraffes in the table. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
