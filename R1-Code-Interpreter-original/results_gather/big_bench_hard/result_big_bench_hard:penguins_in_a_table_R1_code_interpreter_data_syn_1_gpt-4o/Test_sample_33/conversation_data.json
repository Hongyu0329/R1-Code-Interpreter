    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the name of the last giraffe from the given table. The table lists the giraffes with their respective attributes: name, age, height, and weight. The last giraffe in the list is the one that appears at the bottom of the table.\n\nLet's examine the giraffe table:\n\n1. Jody, 5, 430, 620\n2. Gladys, 10, 420, 590\n3. Marian, 2, 310, 410\n4. Donna, 9, 440, 650\n\nThe last giraffe in this list is \"Donna.\"\n\nNow, let's match this with the given options:\n\n(A) Jody\n(B) Gladys\n(C) Marian\n(D) Donna\n(E) Louise\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Donna.\n\n<<<D) Donna>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
