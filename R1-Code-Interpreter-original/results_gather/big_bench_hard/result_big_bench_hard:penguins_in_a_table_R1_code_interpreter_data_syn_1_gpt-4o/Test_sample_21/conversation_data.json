    "To find the cumulated weight of the penguins, we need to sum up the weights of all the penguins listed in the table. The table now includes the following penguins with their respective weights:\n\n- Louis: 11 kg\n- Bernard: 13 kg\n- Vincent: 11 kg\n- Gwen: 15 kg\n- James: 12 kg\n\nWe will calculate the total weight by adding these values together. Let's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Weights of the penguins\nweights = [11, 13, 11, 15, 12]\n\n# Calculate the total weight\ntotal_weight = sum(weights)\n\n# Output the total weight\nprint(total_weight)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the cumulated weight.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the cumulated weight of the penguins. The total weight is 62 kg. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
