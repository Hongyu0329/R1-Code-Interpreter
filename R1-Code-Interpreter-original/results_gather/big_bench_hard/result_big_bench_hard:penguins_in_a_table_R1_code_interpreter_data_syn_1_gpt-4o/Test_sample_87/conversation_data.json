    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old after removing Bernard from the table. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Table**: \n   - Louis: age 7\n   - Bernard: age 5\n   - Vincent: age 9\n   - Gwen: age 8\n\n2. **Remove Bernard**: \n   - After removing Bernard, the table is:\n     - Louis: age 7\n     - Vincent: age 9\n     - Gwen: age 8\n\n3. **Count Penguins Older Than 5 Years**:\n   - Louis is 7 years old, which is more than 5.\n   - Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 5.\n   - Gwen is 8 years old, which is more than 5.\n\nAll three remaining penguins are older than 5 years. Therefore, the number of penguins more than 5 years old is 3.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to count the penguins older than 5 years.\n\n```python\n# List of penguins with their ages after removing Bernard\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8}\n]\n\n# Count penguins older than 5 years\ncount = sum(1 for penguin in penguins if penguin[\"age\"] > 5)\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the count.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the correct count of penguins older than 5 years. Based on the output, the number of penguins more than 5 years old is 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
