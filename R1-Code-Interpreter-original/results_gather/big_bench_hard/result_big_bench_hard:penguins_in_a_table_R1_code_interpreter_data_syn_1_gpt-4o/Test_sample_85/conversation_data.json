    "To solve this problem, we need to first update the table of penguins by adding James and then removing Bernard. After updating the table, we will search for the penguin with a height of 60 cm.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial table:\n   - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n   - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. Add James to the table:\n   - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n3. Remove Bernard from the table.\n\n4. Search for the penguin with a height of 60 cm.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the answer.\n\n```python\n# Initial list of penguins\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7, \"height\": 50, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Bernard\", \"age\": 5, \"height\": 80, \"weight\": 13},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9, \"height\": 60, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8, \"height\": 70, \"weight\": 15}\n]\n\n# Add James\npenguins.append({\"name\": \"James\", \"age\": 12, \"height\": 90, \"weight\": 12})\n\n# Remove Bernard\npenguins = [penguin for penguin in penguins if penguin[\"name\"] != \"Bernard\"]\n\n# Find the penguin with height 60 cm\npenguin_60_cm = next((penguin[\"name\"] for penguin in penguins if penguin[\"height\"] == 60), None)\n\nprint(penguin_60_cm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the name of the penguin that is 60 cm tall.",
    "The code execution confirms that the penguin with a height of 60 cm is Vincent. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<C) Vincent>>>"
