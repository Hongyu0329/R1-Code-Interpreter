    "To determine the name of the last penguin, we need to analyze the given table of penguins:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nBernard, 5, 80, 13\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nThe table lists the penguins in the following order: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. The last penguin in this list is Gwen.\n\nNow, let's verify this by writing a simple Python script to extract the last penguin's name from the list.\n\n```python\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7, \"height\": 50, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Bernard\", \"age\": 5, \"height\": 80, \"weight\": 13},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9, \"height\": 60, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8, \"height\": 70, \"weight\": 15}\n]\n\nlast_penguin_name = penguins[-1][\"name\"]\nprint(last_penguin_name)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the name of the last penguin.",
    "The code execution confirms that the name of the last penguin is Gwen. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D) Gwen>>>"
