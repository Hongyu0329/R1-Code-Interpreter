    "To determine the name of the last penguin, we need to analyze the given table of penguins. The table lists the penguins in the following order:\n\n1. Louis\n2. Bernard\n3. Vincent\n4. Gwen\n\nThe question asks for the name of the last penguin in the list. Based on the order provided, the last penguin is Gwen.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to extract the last name from the list of penguins.\n\n```python\npenguins = [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\"]\nlast_penguin = penguins[-1]\nprint(last_penguin)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the name of the last penguin.",
    "The code execution confirms that the name of the last penguin is \"Gwen\". Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D) Gwen>>>"
