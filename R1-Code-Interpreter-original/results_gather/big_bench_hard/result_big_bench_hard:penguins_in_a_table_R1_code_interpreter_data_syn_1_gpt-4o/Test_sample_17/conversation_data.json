    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of penguins remaining in the table after deleting Bernard. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Initially, we have a table with the following penguins:\n   - Louis\n   - Bernard\n   - Vincent\n   - Gwen\n\n2. We are instructed to delete Bernard from the table.\n\n3. After deleting Bernard, we need to count the remaining penguins.\n\nLet's calculate the number of penguins left after removing Bernard.\n\nInitially, there are 4 penguins. After removing Bernard, we are left with 3 penguins: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins remaining in the table is 3.\n\nThe correct option is (C) 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
