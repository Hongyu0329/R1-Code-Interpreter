    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are less than 10 years old after removing Bernard from the list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial List of Penguins:**\n   - Louis: Age 7\n   - Bernard: Age 5\n   - Vincent: Age 9\n   - Gwen: Age 8\n\n2. **Remove Bernard:**\n   - After removing Bernard, the list of penguins is:\n     - Louis: Age 7\n     - Vincent: Age 9\n     - Gwen: Age 8\n\n3. **Count Penguins Less Than 10 Years Old:**\n   - Louis is 7 years old, which is less than 10.\n   - Vincent is 9 years old, which is less than 10.\n   - Gwen is 8 years old, which is less than 10.\n\nAll three remaining penguins are less than 10 years old. Therefore, the number of penguins less than 10 years old is 3.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to count the penguins less than 10 years old.\n\n```python\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8}\n]\n\ncount = sum(1 for penguin in penguins if penguin[\"age\"] < 10)\nprint(count)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the number of penguins less than 10 years old.",
    "The code execution confirms that there are 3 penguins who are less than 10 years old after removing Bernard from the list. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) 3>>>"
