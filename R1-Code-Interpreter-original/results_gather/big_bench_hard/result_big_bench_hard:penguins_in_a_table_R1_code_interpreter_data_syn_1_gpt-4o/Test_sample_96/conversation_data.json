    "To find the cumulated age of the penguins, we need to sum the ages of all the penguins listed in the table. The penguins and their ages are as follows:\n\n- Louis: 7 years\n- Bernard: 5 years\n- Vincent: 9 years\n- Gwen: 8 years\n- James: 12 years\n\nLet's calculate the total age by summing these values.\n\n```python\n# List of penguin ages\npenguin_ages = [7, 5, 9, 8, 12]\n\n# Calculate the total age\ntotal_age = sum(penguin_ages)\n\n# Output the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the cumulated age of the penguins.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the cumulated age of the penguins, which is 41. Therefore, the correct option is (C) 41.\n\n<<<41>>>"
