    "To determine the total number of animals listed in the tables, we need to count the number of penguins and giraffes provided in the data.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of penguins:\n- Louis\n- Bernard\n- Vincent\n- Gwen\n\nThere are 4 penguins.\n\nNext, let's count the number of giraffes:\n- Jody\n- Gladys\n- Marian\n- Donna\n\nThere are 4 giraffes.\n\nNow, we add the number of penguins and giraffes together to get the total number of animals.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of penguins\npenguins = 4\n\n# Number of giraffes\ngiraffes = 4\n\n# Total number of animals\ntotal_animals = penguins + giraffes\n\nprint(total_animals)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we find that the total number of animals is 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) 8.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and returned the output as expected. The total number of animals listed in the tables is 8, which corresponds to option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
