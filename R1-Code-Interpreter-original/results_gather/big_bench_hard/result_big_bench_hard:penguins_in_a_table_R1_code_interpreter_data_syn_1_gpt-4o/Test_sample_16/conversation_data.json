    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the table of giraffes and count how many of them are more than 5 years old. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Jody is 5 years old.\n2. Gladys is 10 years old.\n3. Marian is 2 years old.\n4. Donna is 9 years old.\n\nWe need to count the number of giraffes whose age is greater than 5. Let's write a Python script to automate this counting process.\n\n```python\n# List of giraffes with their ages\ngiraffes = [\n    {\"name\": \"Jody\", \"age\": 5},\n    {\"name\": \"Gladys\", \"age\": 10},\n    {\"name\": \"Marian\", \"age\": 2},\n    {\"name\": \"Donna\", \"age\": 9}\n]\n\n# Count giraffes older than 5 years\ncount = sum(1 for giraffe in giraffes if giraffe[\"age\"] > 5)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(count)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the number of giraffes older than 5 years.",
    "The code execution output indicates that there are 2 giraffes older than 5 years. Let's verify this with the data:\n\n- Jody is 5 years old (not older than 5).\n- Gladys is 10 years old (older than 5).\n- Marian is 2 years old (not older than 5).\n- Donna is 9 years old (older than 5).\n\nThus, the giraffes older than 5 years are Gladys and Donna, which confirms the count of 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
