    "To determine the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order, we need to list the names of the penguins and sort them alphabetically. The penguins' names are:\n\n- Louis\n- Bernard\n- Vincent\n- Gwen\n- James\n\nLet's sort these names alphabetically and find the last one in the sorted list.\n\n```python\npenguin_names = [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\", \"James\"]\nsorted_names = sorted(penguin_names)\nprint(sorted_names[-1])\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the name of the last penguin in alphabetical order.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the last penguin in alphabetical order is \"Vincent\". Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<Vincent>>>"
