    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of animals (both penguins and giraffes) that are more than 5 years old. We have two tables: one for penguins and one for giraffes. Let's break down the data:\n\n**Penguins:**\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Bernard: 5 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n\n**Giraffes:**\n- Jody: 5 years old\n- Gladys: 10 years old\n- Marian: 2 years old\n- Donna: 9 years old\n\nNow, let's count the animals that are more than 5 years old:\n\n- Penguins: Louis (7), Vincent (9), Gwen (8)\n- Giraffes: Gladys (10), Donna (9)\n\nWe can see that Bernard and Jody are exactly 5 years old, and Marian is 2 years old, so they do not count.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this counting process:\n\n```python\n# Define the data for penguins and giraffes\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7},\n    {\"name\": \"Bernard\", \"age\": 5},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8}\n]\n\ngiraffes = [\n    {\"name\": \"Jody\", \"age\": 5},\n    {\"name\": \"Gladys\", \"age\": 10},\n    {\"name\": \"Marian\", \"age\": 2},\n    {\"name\": \"Donna\", \"age\": 9}\n]\n\n# Count animals more than 5 years old\ncount = 0\n\n# Check penguins\nfor penguin in penguins:\n    if penguin[\"age\"] > 5:\n        count += 1\n\n# Check giraffes\nfor giraffe in giraffes:\n    if giraffe[\"age\"] > 5:\n        count += 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(count)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of animals more than 5 years old.",
    "The code execution output indicates that there are 5 animals more than 5 years old. This matches our manual count:\n\n- Penguins: Louis (7), Vincent (9), Gwen (8)\n- Giraffes: Gladys (10), Donna (9)\n\nThus, the total number of animals more than 5 years old is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
