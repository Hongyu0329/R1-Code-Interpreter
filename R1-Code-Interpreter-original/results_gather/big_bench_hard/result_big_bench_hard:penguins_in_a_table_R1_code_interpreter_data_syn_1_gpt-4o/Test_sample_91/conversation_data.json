    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins in the table are less than 10 years old. We have the following penguins with their respective ages:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old\n2. Bernard: 5 years old\n3. Vincent: 9 years old\n4. Gwen: 8 years old\n5. James: 12 years old\n\nWe will count the number of penguins whose age is less than 10.\n\nLet's write a Python script to count the number of penguins under 10 years old.\n\n```python\n# List of penguins with their ages\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7},\n    {\"name\": \"Bernard\", \"age\": 5},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8},\n    {\"name\": \"James\", \"age\": 12}\n]\n\n# Count penguins with age less than 10\ncount_under_10 = sum(1 for penguin in penguins if penguin[\"age\"] < 10)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(count_under_10)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution output indicates that there are 4 penguins who are less than 10 years old. Let's verify this with the list of penguins:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old (less than 10)\n2. Bernard: 5 years old (less than 10)\n3. Vincent: 9 years old (less than 10)\n4. Gwen: 8 years old (less than 10)\n5. James: 12 years old (not less than 10)\n\nIndeed, there are 4 penguins who are less than 10 years old. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<(D) 4>>>"
