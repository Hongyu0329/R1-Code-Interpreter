    "To find the cumulated age of the animals, we need to sum the ages of all the penguins and giraffes listed in the tables.\n\nFirst, let's list the ages of the penguins:\n- Louis: 7\n- Bernard: 5\n- Vincent: 9\n- Gwen: 8\n- James: 12\n\nNext, let's list the ages of the giraffes:\n- Jody: 5\n- Gladys: 10\n- Marian: 2\n- Donna: 9\n\nNow, we will calculate the total age by summing these values.\n\n```python\n# Ages of penguins\npenguin_ages = [7, 5, 9, 8, 12]\n\n# Ages of giraffes\ngiraffe_ages = [5, 10, 2, 9]\n\n# Calculate the total age\ntotal_age = sum(penguin_ages) + sum(giraffe_ages)\n\n# Output the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the cumulated age of the animals.",
    "The cumulated age of all the animals, which includes both the penguins and the giraffes, is 67. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
