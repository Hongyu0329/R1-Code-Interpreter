    "To solve this problem, we need to identify which penguin is less than 7 years old based on the given data. Let's break down the information provided:\n\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Bernard: 5 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n\nWe need to find the penguin whose age is less than 7. Let's analyze the ages:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is not less than 7.\n- Bernard is 5 years old, which is less than 7.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is not less than 7.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is not less than 7.\n\nFrom this analysis, Bernard is the only penguin who is less than 7 years old.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<Bernard>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
