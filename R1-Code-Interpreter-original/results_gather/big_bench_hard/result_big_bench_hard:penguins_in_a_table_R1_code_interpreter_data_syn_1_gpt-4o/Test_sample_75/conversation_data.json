    "To determine the total number of animals listed in the tables, we need to count the number of penguins and giraffes.\n\nFirst, let's count the penguins:\n- Louis\n- Bernard\n- Vincent\n- Gwen\n- James\n\nThere are 5 penguins listed.\n\nNext, let's count the giraffes:\n- Jody\n- Gladys\n- Marian\n- Donna\n\nThere are 4 giraffes listed.\n\nNow, we add the number of penguins and giraffes together to get the total number of animals.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of penguins\npenguins = 5\n\n# Number of giraffes\ngiraffes = 4\n\n# Total number of animals\ntotal_animals = penguins + giraffes\n\nprint(total_animals)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we find that the total number of animals is 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) 9.\n\n<<<9>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is 9. This confirms that the total number of animals listed in the tables is 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
