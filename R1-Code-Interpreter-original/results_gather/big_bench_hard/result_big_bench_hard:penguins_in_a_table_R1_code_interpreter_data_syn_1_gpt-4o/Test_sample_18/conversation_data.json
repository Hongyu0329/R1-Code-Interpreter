  "question": "Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nWhat is the average height of the penguins?\nOptions:\n(A) 60\n(B) 65\n(C) 70\n(D) 75\n(E) 80\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To find the average height of the penguins, we need to sum up the heights of all the penguins and then divide by the number of penguins. \n\nLet's list the heights of the penguins:\n- Louis: 50 cm\n- Bernard: 80 cm\n- Vincent: 60 cm\n- Gwen: 70 cm\n- James: 90 cm\n\nNow, we will calculate the average height using these values.\n\n```python\n# Heights of the penguins\nheights = [50, 80, 60, 70, 90]\n\n# Calculate the average height\naverage_height = sum(heights) / len(heights)\n\n# Print the average height\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the average height, which we can then compare with the given options to find the correct answer.",
    "The code output indicates that the average height of the penguins is 70.0 cm. Now, let's compare this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 60\n(B) 65\n(C) 70\n(D) 75\n(E) 80\n\nThe average height of 70.0 cm matches option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
