We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nHow many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight less than 12 kg?\nOptions:\n(A) 1\n(B) 2\n(C) 3\n(D) 4\n(E) 5\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the data provided for each penguin and count how many meet the criteria of being less than 8 years old and weighing less than 12 kg.\n\nLet's break down the data:\n\n1. Louis: age 7, weight 11 kg\n2. Bernard: age 5, weight 13 kg\n3. Vincent: age 9, weight 11 kg\n4. Gwen: age 8, weight 15 kg\n5. James: age 12, weight 12 kg\n\nNow, we will check each penguin against the criteria:\n\n- Louis: age 7 < 8 and weight 11 < 12 (meets criteria)\n- Bernard: age 5 < 8 but weight 13 >= 12 (does not meet criteria)\n- Vincent: age 9 >= 8 (does not meet criteria)\n- Gwen: age 8 >= 8 (does not meet criteria)\n- James: age 12 >= 8 (does not meet criteria)\n\nOnly Louis meets both criteria. Therefore, there is 1 penguin that is less than 8 years old and weighs less than 12 kg.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Bernard\", \"age\": 5, \"weight\": 13},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8, \"weight\": 15},\n    {\"name\": \"James\", \"age\": 12, \"weight\": 12}\n]\n\ncount = sum(1 for penguin in penguins if penguin[\"age\"] < 8 and penguin[\"weight\"] < 12)\nprint(count)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that there is 1 penguin that is less than 8 years old and weighs less than 12 kg. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
