    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total age of all the penguins listed in the table. The table provides the following information:\n\n- Louis: age 7\n- Bernard: age 5\n- Vincent: age 9\n- Gwen: age 8\n\nThe task is to sum these ages to find the cumulated age of the penguins. Let's calculate this using a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the ages of the penguins\nages = [7, 5, 9, 8]\n\n# Calculate the cumulated age\ncumulated_age = sum(ages)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(cumulated_age)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the cumulated age of the penguins.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the cumulated age of the penguins. Based on the output, the total age of all the penguins is 29.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<(B) 29>>>"
