    "To solve this problem, we need to extract the height of Gwen from the given table. The table provides the following information:\n\n- Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n- Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n- Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n- Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\nWe are specifically interested in the height of Gwen. According to the table, Gwen's height is 70 cm.\n\nNow, let's match this height with the given options:\n\n(A) 50\n(B) 80\n(C) 60\n(D) 70\n(E) 90\n\nThe correct option that matches Gwen's height is (D) 70.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
