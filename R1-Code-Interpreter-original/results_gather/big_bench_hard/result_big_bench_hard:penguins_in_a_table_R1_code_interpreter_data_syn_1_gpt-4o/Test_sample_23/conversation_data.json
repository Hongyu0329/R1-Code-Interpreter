    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the data of the penguins and determine how many of them are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. \n\nLet's break down the data:\n\n1. Louis: Age = 7, Weight = 11 kg\n2. Bernard: Age = 5, Weight = 13 kg\n3. Vincent: Age = 9, Weight = 11 kg\n4. Gwen: Age = 8, Weight = 15 kg\n5. James: Age = 12, Weight = 12 kg\n\nWe need to check each penguin to see if they meet both criteria: age > 5 and weight > 12 kg.\n\n- Louis: Age > 5 (True), Weight > 12 (False)\n- Bernard: Age > 5 (False), Weight > 12 (True)\n- Vincent: Age > 5 (True), Weight > 12 (False)\n- Gwen: Age > 5 (True), Weight > 12 (True)\n- James: Age > 5 (True), Weight > 12 (False)\n\nFrom this analysis, only Gwen meets both criteria.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Bernard\", \"age\": 5, \"weight\": 13},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8, \"weight\": 15},\n    {\"name\": \"James\", \"age\": 12, \"weight\": 12}\n]\n\ncount = 0\nfor penguin in penguins:\n    if penguin[\"age\"] > 5 and penguin[\"weight\"] > 12:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that there is only one penguin that is more than 5 years old and weighs more than 12 kg. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) 1>>>"
