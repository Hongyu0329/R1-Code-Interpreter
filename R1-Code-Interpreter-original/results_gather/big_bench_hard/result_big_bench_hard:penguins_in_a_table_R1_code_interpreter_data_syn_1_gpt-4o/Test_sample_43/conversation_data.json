    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of animals (both penguins and giraffes) that are more than 5 years old. We have two tables: one for penguins and one for giraffes. Let's list the ages of each animal and determine how many are older than 5 years.\n\n**Penguins:**\n- Louis: 7 years\n- Bernard: 5 years\n- Vincent: 9 years\n- Gwen: 8 years\n- James: 12 years\n\n**Giraffes:**\n- Jody: 5 years\n- Gladys: 10 years\n- Marian: 2 years\n- Donna: 9 years\n\nNow, let's count the number of animals older than 5 years:\n\n- Penguins older than 5 years: Louis, Vincent, Gwen, James (4 penguins)\n- Giraffes older than 5 years: Gladys, Donna (2 giraffes)\n\nTotal animals older than 5 years = 4 (penguins) + 2 (giraffes) = 6 animals.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# List of ages for penguins and giraffes\npenguin_ages = [7, 5, 9, 8, 12]\ngiraffe_ages = [5, 10, 2, 9]\n\n# Count animals older than 5 years\ncount = sum(age > 5 for age in penguin_ages + giraffe_ages)\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the count.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed that there are 6 animals older than 5 years. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
