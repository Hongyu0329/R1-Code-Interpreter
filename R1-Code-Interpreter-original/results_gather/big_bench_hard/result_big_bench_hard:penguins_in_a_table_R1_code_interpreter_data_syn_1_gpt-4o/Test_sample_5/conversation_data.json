    "To find the cumulated age of the giraffes, we need to sum up the ages of all the giraffes listed in the table. The ages of the giraffes are as follows:\n\n- Jody: 5 years\n- Gladys: 10 years\n- Marian: 2 years\n- Donna: 9 years\n\nWe will calculate the sum of these ages using a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# Ages of the giraffes\nages = [5, 10, 2, 9]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the ages\ncumulated_age = sum(ages)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(cumulated_age)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the cumulated age of the giraffes.",
    "The cumulated age of the giraffes is 26 years. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
