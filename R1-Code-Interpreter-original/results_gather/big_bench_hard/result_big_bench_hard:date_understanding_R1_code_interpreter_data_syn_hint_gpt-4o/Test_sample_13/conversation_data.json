    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the palindrome day of 2020 in the MMDDYYYY format. A palindrome day is a date that reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nThe date format is MMDDYYYY, so we need to find a date in 2020 that satisfies this condition. \n\nLet's consider the possible palindrome dates in 2020:\n- The year is 2020, so the last four digits are 2020.\n- The first four digits (MMDD) should be the reverse of 2020, which is 0202.\n\nThus, the palindrome date in 2020 is 02/02/2020.\n\nNow, we need to find the date exactly one month before 02/02/2020. One month before February 2, 2020, is January 2, 2020.\n\nLet's check the options:\n(A) 01/01/2020\n(B) 01/02/2020\n(C) 10/02/2019\n(D) 11/05/2019\n(E) 01/02/1931\n(F) 01/03/2020\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 01/02/2020.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) 01/02/2020"
