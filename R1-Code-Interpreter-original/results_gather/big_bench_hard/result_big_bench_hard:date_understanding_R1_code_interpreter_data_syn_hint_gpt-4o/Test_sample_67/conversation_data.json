    "To solve this problem, we need to determine today's date and then calculate the date one week ago. The problem states that it was September 1st, 2021, a week ago. This means that today is September 8th, 2021.\n\nNow, we need to find the date one week ago from today, which is September 8th, 2021. Subtracting 7 days from September 8th, 2021, gives us September 1st, 2021.\n\nLet's verify this by checking the options provided:\n\n(A) 09/02/2021 - This is one day after September 1st, 2021.\n(B) 09/07/2021 - This is one day before September 8th, 2021.\n(C) 09/01/2021 - This matches the date we calculated.\n(D) 09/01/2098 - This is far in the future.\n(E) 09/01/2020 - This is one year before the date we calculated.\n(F) 12/06/2021 - This is several months after the date we calculated.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C) 09/01/2021.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) 09/01/2021 <<<answer>>>"
