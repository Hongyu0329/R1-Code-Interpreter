    "To solve this problem, we need to determine Jane's birth date and then calculate the date 24 hours after her 16th birthday.\n\n1. **Determine Jane's Birth Date:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001. Since 2001 is not a leap year, the last day of February is February 28, 2001.\n\n2. **Calculate Jane's 16th Birthday:**\n   - Jane's 16th birthday would be 16 years after February 28, 2001. Therefore, her 16th birthday is on February 28, 2017.\n\n3. **Calculate the Date 24 Hours Later:**\n   - 24 hours after February 28, 2017, is March 1, 2017.\n\nNow, let's check the options to find the correct answer:\n\n- (A) 05/04/2017\n- (B) 03/01/1919\n- (C) 03/01/2017\n- (D) 03/01/2005\n- (E) 02/15/2017\n- (F) 06/02/2017\n\nThe correct date, March 1, 2017, matches option (C).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) 03/01/2017"
