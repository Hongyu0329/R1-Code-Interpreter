    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Jane's 16th birthday and then find the date of the following day.\n\n1. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000. Since 2000 is a leap year, the last day of February is February 29, 2000.\n\n2. Jane's 16th birthday would be 16 years after February 29, 2000. Since 2016 is also a leap year, her 16th birthday would be on February 29, 2016.\n\n3. The day after February 29, 2016, is March 1, 2016.\n\nNow, let's match this date with the given options:\n\n- (A) 03/02/2016\n- (B) 03/01/1968\n- (C) 02/20/2016\n- (D) 03/01/2016\n- (E) 03/01/2104\n- (F) 03/01/2048\n\nThe correct date, March 1, 2016, matches option (D).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (D) 03/01/2016 <<<answer>>>"
