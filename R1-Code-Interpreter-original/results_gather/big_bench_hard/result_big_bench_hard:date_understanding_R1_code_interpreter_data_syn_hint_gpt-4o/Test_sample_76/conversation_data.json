    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current date based on the information given and then calculate the date one month prior to that.\n\n1. Jane got her job in 2016, and today is her 3-year work anniversary. This means she started her job in 2016 + 3 years = 2019.\n2. Her work anniversary is today, which means today is the same date she started her job in 2016.\n3. She remembers spilling coffee on her laptop on December 2, which was her second day at work. Therefore, she started her job on December 1, 2016.\n4. Since today is her 3-year work anniversary, today is December 1, 2019.\n5. We need to find the date one month before December 1, 2019.\n\nCalculating one month before December 1, 2019, would be November 1, 2019.\n\nNow, let's match this date with the options provided:\n\n(A) 11/01/2019 - This matches the date we calculated.\n(B) 11/02/2019\n(C) 09/06/2019\n(D) 11/01/1933\n(E) 11/01/2089\n(F) 08/04/2019\n\nThe correct option is (A) 11/01/2019.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
