    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 10 days before the given deadline of June 1, 2021. \n\n1. Start by identifying the date 10 days before June 1, 2021.\n2. Subtract 10 days from June 1, 2021.\n3. Calculate the resulting date and match it with the options provided.\n\nLet's perform the calculation:\n\n- June 1, 2021 minus 10 days is May 22, 2021.\n\nNow, let's match this date with the options provided:\n\n(A) 04/29/2021\n(B) 05/21/2021\n(C) 04/06/2021\n(D) 06/24/2021\n(E) 05/20/2021\n\nNone of the options directly match May 22, 2021. However, the closest date to May 22, 2021, in the options is May 21, 2021, which is option (B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B) 05/21/2021.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) 05/21/2021 <<<answer>>>"
