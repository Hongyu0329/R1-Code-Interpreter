    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one year ago from today. Since the problem doesn't specify today's date, we need to deduce it from the information given.\n\n1. Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020.\n2. 176 days have passed since then.\n\nLet's calculate the date 176 days after March 20, 2020, to find today's date.\n\n- March 20, 2020, is the 80th day of the year (considering 2020 is a leap year).\n- Adding 176 days to March 20, 2020, gives us the 256th day of the year 2020.\n\nNow, let's determine which date corresponds to the 256th day of the year 2020.\n\n- January has 31 days.\n- February has 29 days (leap year).\n- March has 31 days.\n- April has 30 days.\n- May has 31 days.\n- June has 30 days.\n- July has 31 days.\n- August has 31 days.\n\nBy the end of August, we have 244 days (31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 244).\n\nThe 256th day of the year is 12 days into September (256 - 244 = 12).\n\nTherefore, today's date is September 12, 2020.\n\nNow, we need to find the date one year ago from September 12, 2020, which is September 12, 2019.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n(A) 09/20/2019\n(B) 10/01/2019\n(C) 10/24/2019\n(D) 09/12/1970\n(E) 09/12/2019\n\nThe correct option is (E) 09/12/2019.\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) 09/12/2019"
