    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in the US for the year 2001 and then calculate the date 24 hours later.\n\n1. **Determine Thanksgiving Date in 2001:**\n   - Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November.\n   - We need to find the fourth Thursday of November 2001.\n\n2. **Calculate the Date 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Once we have the date of Thanksgiving, we simply add one day to find the date 24 hours later.\n\nLet's start by finding the fourth Thursday of November 2001.\n\nNovember 1, 2001, was a Thursday. Therefore, the Thursdays in November 2001 were:\n- November 1\n- November 8\n- November 15\n- November 22\n\nThus, the fourth Thursday of November 2001 was November 22, 2001.\n\nNow, we add one day to November 22, 2001, to find the date 24 hours later.\n\nNovember 22, 2001 + 1 day = November 23, 2001.\n\nNow, let's check the options provided:\n- (A) 12/01/2002\n- (B) 11/24/2002\n- (C) 06/23/2003\n- (D) 05/23/2002\n- (E) 11/23/2002\n\nThe correct date, November 23, 2001, is not listed in the options. However, the closest match in terms of month and day is option (E) 11/23/2002, which is incorrect because it is a year later.\n\nSince none of the options match the correct date, the problem might have an error in the options provided. However, based on the calculation, the date 24 hours after Thanksgiving 2001 is November 23, 2001.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the calculation is not present in the options, but the closest incorrect option is (E) 11/23/2002.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
