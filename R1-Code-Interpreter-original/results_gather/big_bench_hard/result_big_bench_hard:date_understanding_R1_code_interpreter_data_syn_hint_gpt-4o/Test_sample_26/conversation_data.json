    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current date based on the given deadline and then calculate the date one week ago from that current date.\n\n1. The deadline is June 1, 2021, which is 2 days away from the current date.\n2. Therefore, the current date is May 30, 2021.\n3. To find the date one week ago from May 30, 2021, we subtract 7 days from it.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Current date based on the deadline\ncurrent_date = datetime(2021, 5, 30)\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = current_date - timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the date one week ago from May 30, 2021.",
    "The code execution result shows that the date one week ago from May 30, 2021, is May 23, 2021. This matches one of the options provided.\n\nLet's review the options:\n\n(A) 05/23/2020  \n(B) 04/13/2021  \n(C) 05/24/2021  \n(D) 05/23/2054  \n(E) 05/23/1940  \n(F) 05/23/2021  \n\nThe correct option based on the code output is (F) 05/23/2021.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (F) 05/23/2021"
