    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date that is exactly ten years after May 6, 1992, and then find the date that is one day before that.\n\n1. Start with the given date: May 6, 1992.\n2. Add ten years to this date: May 6, 1992 + 10 years = May 6, 2002.\n3. Subtract one day to find the date yesterday: May 6, 2002 - 1 day = May 5, 2002.\n\nNow, let's check the options to find the correct answer:\n\n- (A) 05/26/2002: This is incorrect because it is not one day before May 6, 2002.\n- (B) 05/05/2001: This is incorrect because it is one year earlier than the required date.\n- (C) 05/05/1902: This is incorrect because it is 100 years earlier than the required date.\n- (D) 05/05/2084: This is incorrect because it is far in the future.\n- (E) 05/01/2002: This is incorrect because it is five days earlier than the required date.\n- (F) 05/05/2002: This is correct because it is one day before May 6, 2002.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (F) 05/05/2002.\n\n<<<answer>>> (F) 05/05/2002 <<<answer>>>"
