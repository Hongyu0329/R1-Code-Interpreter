    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Jane's 16th birthday and then find the date of the following day.\n\n1. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001. Since 2001 is not a leap year, the last day of February is February 28, 2001.\n\n2. Jane's 16th birthday would be 16 years after February 28, 2001. Therefore, her 16th birthday is on February 28, 2017.\n\n3. The day after February 28, 2017, is March 1, 2017.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n- (A) 03/25/2017\n- (B) 03/01/2017\n- (C) 03/01/2116\n- (D) 02/20/2017\n- (E) 03/17/2017\n- (F) 03/01/2076\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 03/01/2017.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) 03/01/2017"
