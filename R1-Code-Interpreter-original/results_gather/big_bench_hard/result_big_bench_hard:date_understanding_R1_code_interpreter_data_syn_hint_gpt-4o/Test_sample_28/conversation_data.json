    "To solve this problem, we need to determine today's date and then calculate the date one week ago from today.\n\n1. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - Yesterday was April 30, 2021. Therefore, today is May 1, 2021.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week Ago:**\n   - One week ago from May 1, 2021, would be 7 days before May 1, 2021.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Today's date is May 1, 2021\ntoday_date = datetime(2021, 5, 1)\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago\none_week_ago = today_date - timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the date one week ago from today.",
    "The code execution result shows that the date one week ago from today, May 1, 2021, is April 24, 2021. \n\nNow, let's match this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 05/15/2021  \n(B) 04/23/2021  \n(C) 04/15/2021  \n(D) 06/05/2021  \n(E) 04/19/2021  \n(F) 04/24/2021  \n\nThe correct option that matches the calculated date is (F) 04/24/2021.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today is April 24, 2021.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
