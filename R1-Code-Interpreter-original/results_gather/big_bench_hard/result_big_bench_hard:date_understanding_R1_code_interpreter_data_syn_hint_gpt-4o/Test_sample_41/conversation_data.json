    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week from the correct date, which is 6/19/2019. \n\n1. Start with the correct date: 6/19/2019.\n2. Add 7 days to this date to find the date one week later.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Correct date\ncorrect_date = datetime.strptime(\"06/19/2019\", \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n# Add 7 days\none_week_later = correct_date + timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the new date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_later.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the date one week from 6/19/2019.",
    "The code execution result shows that the date one week from 6/19/2019 is 06/26/2019. This matches option (E) from the provided list of options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> (E) 06/26/2019"
