    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 24 hours after the given date, which is the second day of the third month of 1966, or 03/02/1966.\n\n1. **Understanding the Date**: The given date is 03/02/1966, which is March 2, 1966.\n\n2. **Adding 24 Hours**: Adding 24 hours to a date simply means moving to the next day. Therefore, 24 hours after March 2, 1966, would be March 3, 1966.\n\n3. **Selecting the Correct Option**: We need to find the option that matches the date March 3, 1966.\n\nLet's review the options:\n- (A) 03/04/1966\n- (B) 04/03/1966\n- (C) 03/03/1965\n- (D) 03/03/2021\n- (E) 03/02/1966\n- (F) 03/03/1966\n\nThe correct date, March 3, 1966, matches option (F).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (F) 03/03/1966"
