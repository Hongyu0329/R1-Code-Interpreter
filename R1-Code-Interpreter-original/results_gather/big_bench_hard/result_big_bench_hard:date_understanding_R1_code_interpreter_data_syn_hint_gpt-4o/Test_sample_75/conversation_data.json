    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the last day of the first quarter of 2008 and then calculate the date one week from that day.\n\n1. **Identify the last day of the first quarter of 2008:**\n   - The first quarter of the year includes January, February, and March.\n   - Therefore, the last day of the first quarter is March 31, 2008.\n\n2. **Calculate the date one week from March 31, 2008:**\n   - One week from March 31, 2008, is 7 days later.\n   - We need to add 7 days to March 31, 2008.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the last day of the first quarter of 2008\nlast_day_first_quarter = datetime(2008, 3, 31)\n\n# Calculate the date one week from this day\none_week_later = last_day_first_quarter + timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_later.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the date one week from March 31, 2008, formatted in MM/DD/YYYY.",
    "The code execution result shows that one week from March 31, 2008, is April 7, 2008. This matches one of the options provided.\n\nLet's verify the options:\n\n- (A) 04/15/2008\n- (B) 10/07/2008\n- (C) 09/07/2008\n- (D) 03/24/2008\n- (E) 04/07/2008\n- (F) 04/06/2008\n\nThe correct date, 04/07/2008, corresponds to option (E).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) 04/07/2008 <<<answer>>>"
