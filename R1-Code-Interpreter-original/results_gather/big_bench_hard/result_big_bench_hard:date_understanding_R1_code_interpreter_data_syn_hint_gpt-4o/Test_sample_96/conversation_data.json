    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs and then calculate the date 10 days before that.\n\n1. **Determine the date Jane ran out of eggs:**\n   - Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.\n   - She ate one egg per day.\n   - Therefore, she would run out of eggs 40 days after May 9th, 2017.\n\n2. **Calculate the date 40 days after May 9th, 2017:**\n   - May has 31 days. From May 9th to May 31st, there are 22 days.\n   - Therefore, 40 - 22 = 18 days into June.\n\n3. **Determine the date 18 days into June:**\n   - Starting from June 1st, 18 days later is June 18th, 2017.\n\n4. **Calculate the date 10 days before June 18th, 2017:**\n   - 10 days before June 18th is June 8th, 2017.\n\nNow, let's check the options to find the correct answer.\n\nThe date 10 days before June 18th, 2017, is June 8th, 2017, which matches option (E).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) 06/08/2017"
