    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 10 days before Jane's 16th birthday. \n\n1. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001. Since 2001 is not a leap year, the last day of February is February 28, 2001.\n2. Jane's 16th birthday would be 16 years after February 28, 2001, which is February 28, 2017.\n3. We need to find the date 10 days before February 28, 2017.\n\nLet's calculate this by subtracting 10 days from February 28, 2017.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Jane's 16th birthday\nbirthday_16 = datetime(2017, 2, 28)\n\n# Calculate the date 10 days before\ndate_10_days_before = birthday_16 - timedelta(days=10)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = date_10_days_before.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the date 10 days before February 28, 2017.",
    "The code execution result shows that the date 10 days before February 28, 2017, is February 18, 2017. This matches one of the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> (B) 02/18/2017"
