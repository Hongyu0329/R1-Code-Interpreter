    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the date format and calculate the next day. The given date is 02/01/1987 in the UK format, which means the 2nd of January, 1987. \n\nTo find the date tomorrow, we need to add one day to this date. January has 31 days, so adding one day to January 2nd will result in January 3rd, 1987.\n\nNow, we need to convert this date into the MM/DD/YYYY format, which is commonly used in the United States. In this format, the month comes first, followed by the day, and then the year.\n\nTherefore, January 3rd, 1987, in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/03/1987.\n\nLet's check the options:\n- (A) 12/06/1986\n- (B) 01/03/1987\n- (C) 01/04/1987\n- (D) 01/09/1987\n- (E) 01/03/2035\n- (F) 02/03/1986\n\nThe correct option is (B) 01/03/1987.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) 01/03/1987"
