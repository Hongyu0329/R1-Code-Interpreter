    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one year ago from today, which is April 10, 1985.\n\n1. **Identify today's date**: April 10, 1985.\n2. **Calculate one year ago from today**: Subtract one year from the current year, 1985, which gives us 1984.\n3. **Determine the date one year ago**: The month and day remain the same, so the date one year ago is April 10, 1984.\n\nNow, let's match this date with the given options:\n\n- (A) 03/10/1986: This is March 10, 1986, which is not correct.\n- (B) 04/07/1985: This is April 7, 1985, which is not correct.\n- (C) 05/13/1985: This is May 13, 1985, which is not correct.\n- (D) 04/10/1984: This is April 10, 1984, which matches our calculated date.\n- (E) 04/12/1986: This is April 12, 1986, which is not correct.\n- (F) 04/10/1985: This is April 10, 1985, which is not correct.\n\nThe correct option is (D) 04/10/1984.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
