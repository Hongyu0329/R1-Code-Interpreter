    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 24 hours after January 31, 2012. \n\n1. **Understanding the Date Transition**: \n   - January 31, 2012, is the last day of January.\n   - Adding 24 hours to this date means moving to the next day, which is February 1, 2012.\n\n2. **Leap Year Consideration**: \n   - 2012 is a leap year, but this does not affect the transition from January to February since January always has 31 days.\n\n3. **Matching with Options**:\n   - We need to find which option corresponds to February 1, 2012.\n\nLet's review the options:\n- (A) 01/31/2012: This is the same day, not 24 hours later.\n- (B) 02/01/2016: This is February 1, but in the wrong year.\n- (C) 02/01/2079: This is February 1, but in the wrong year.\n- (D) 11/10/2011: This is a completely different date.\n- (E) 01/04/2012: This is a date in January, not February.\n- (F) 02/01/2012: This is the correct date, February 1, 2012.\n\nThe correct answer is option (F) 02/01/2012.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
