    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one year before Jane's 16th birthday. \n\n1. **Determine Jane's Birth Date:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000. Since 2000 is a leap year, the last day of February is February 29, 2000.\n\n2. **Determine Jane's 16th Birthday:**\n   - If Jane was born on February 29, 2000, her 16th birthday would be on February 29, 2016. However, 2016 is also a leap year, so February 29 exists.\n\n3. **Calculate the Date One Year Ago:**\n   - One year before February 29, 2016, is February 28, 2015, because 2015 is not a leap year, and February 28 is the last day of February in non-leap years.\n\nNow, let's check the options provided:\n\n- (A) 02/28/2015\n- (B) 03/10/2015\n- (C) 03/08/2015\n- (D) 04/28/2015\n- (E) 02/21/2015\n- (F) 03/28/2015\n\nThe correct answer is option (A) 02/28/2015.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
