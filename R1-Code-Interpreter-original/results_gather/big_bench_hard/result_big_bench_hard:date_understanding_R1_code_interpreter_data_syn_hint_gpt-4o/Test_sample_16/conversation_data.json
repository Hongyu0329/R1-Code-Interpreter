    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current date based on the information given. Jane feels that May 6, 1992, is like yesterday, but it is actually ten years ago. This means that the current date is ten years after May 6, 1992.\n\nLet's calculate the date ten years after May 6, 1992:\n\n- Start date: May 6, 1992\n- Add 10 years: May 6, 2002\n\nNow, we need to find the option that matches this date.\n\nThe correct date is May 6, 2002, which corresponds to option (E) 05/06/2002.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) 05/06/2002"
