    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs and then add 24 hours to that date.\n\n1. Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.\n2. She ate one egg per day.\n3. Therefore, she would have run out of eggs after 40 days.\n\nLet's calculate the date 40 days after May 9th, 2017.\n\n- May has 31 days. From May 9th to May 31st, there are 31 - 9 + 1 = 23 days.\n- After May 31st, she needs 40 - 23 = 17 more days to finish the eggs.\n- 17 days into June would be June 17th, 2017.\n\nTherefore, Jane ran out of eggs on June 17th, 2017. Adding 24 hours (1 day) to this date gives us June 18th, 2017.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) 06/19/2017\n(B) 07/17/2017\n(C) 06/20/2017\n(D) 06/18/2017\n(E) 06/15/2017\n(F) 07/10/2017\n\nThe correct answer is (D) 06/18/2017.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
