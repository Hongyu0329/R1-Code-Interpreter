    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs. Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and ate one egg per day. Therefore, she would have run out of eggs 40 days after May 9th, 2017.\n\nLet's calculate the date 40 days after May 9th, 2017. We can do this by adding 40 days to May 9th, 2017.\n\n1. Start from May 9th, 2017.\n2. May has 31 days, so from May 9th to May 31st, there are 22 days.\n3. Subtract these 22 days from 40 days, leaving 18 days to be added in June.\n4. Add 18 days to June 1st, 2017, which results in June 19th, 2017.\n\nSince Jane ran out of eggs on June 19th, 2017, the date yesterday would be June 18th, 2017.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) 07/18/2017\n(B) 06/17/2017\n(C) 06/17/2111\n(D) 07/13/2017\n(E) 06/26/2017\n(F) 06/25/2017\n\nThe correct date, June 18th, 2017, is not listed in the options. However, the closest date before June 19th, 2017, is June 17th, 2017, which is option (B).\n\nTherefore, the answer is option (B) 06/17/2017.\n\n<<<B>>>"
