    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date today based on the information given about Jane's birthday.\n\n1. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001. Since 2001 is not a leap year, the last day of February is February 28, 2001.\n\n2. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. This means that 16 years have passed since her birth date.\n\n3. We need to calculate the date 16 years after February 28, 2001.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- Start from February 28, 2001.\n- Add 16 years to the year 2001, which gives us 2017.\n- Therefore, the date 16 years after February 28, 2001, is February 28, 2017.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) 08/28/2017 - This is not correct because it is in August.\n(B) 02/22/2017 - This is not correct because it is before February 28.\n(C) 03/01/2017 - This is not correct because it is after February 28.\n(D) 01/28/2018 - This is not correct because it is in the next year.\n(E) 02/07/2017 - This is not correct because it is before February 28.\n(F) 02/28/2017 - This is correct because it matches the calculated date.\n\nThe correct answer is option (F) 02/28/2017.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
