    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 24 hours after July 29, 2002. \n\n1. Start with the given date: July 29, 2002.\n2. Add 24 hours to this date. Since 24 hours is equivalent to one day, we simply need to add one day to the given date.\n3. Adding one day to July 29, 2002, results in July 30, 2002.\n\nNow, let's match this result with the options provided:\n\n- (A) 07/29/2001: This is incorrect because the year is 2001, not 2002.\n- (B) 04/24/2002: This is incorrect because both the month and day are different.\n- (C) 07/30/2002: This is correct as it matches the calculated date.\n- (D) 07/28/2002: This is incorrect because it is one day before the given date.\n- (E) 07/29/2002: This is incorrect because it is the same as the given date.\n- (F) 07/29/1947: This is incorrect because the year is 1947, not 2002.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C) 07/30/2002.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
