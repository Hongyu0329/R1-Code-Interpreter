    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week ago from today, given that 176 days have passed since Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020.\n\n1. **Calculate the date 176 days after March 20, 2020:**\n   - Start from March 20, 2020.\n   - Add 176 days to this date to find the current date.\n\n2. **Determine the date one week ago from the current date:**\n   - Subtract 7 days from the current date to find the date one week ago.\n\n3. **Compare the calculated date with the given options to find the correct answer.**\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020\nstart_date = datetime(2020, 3, 20)\n\n# 176 days have passed since then\ncurrent_date = start_date + timedelta(days=176)\n\n# Calculate the date one week ago from the current date\none_week_ago = current_date - timedelta(weeks=1)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = one_week_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the date one week ago from today.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the date one week ago from today is 09/05/2020. Now, let's compare this result with the given options:\n\n(A) 02/05/2021  \n(B) 09/05/2020  \n(C) 08/15/2020  \n(D) 09/06/2020  \n(E) 09/04/2020  \n\nThe calculated date, 09/05/2020, matches option (B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) 09/05/2020 <<<answer>>>"
