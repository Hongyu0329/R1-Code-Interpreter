    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 10 days before Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary marks 50 years of marriage. Since they married on January 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary would be on January 2, 2008.\n\nNow, we need to find the date 10 days before January 2, 2008. We can calculate this by subtracting 10 days from January 2, 2008.\n\nLet's perform the calculation:\n\n1. Start from January 2, 2008.\n2. Subtract 10 days to find the date 10 days earlier.\n\nWe can use Python to perform this date calculation efficiently.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the date of the golden wedding anniversary\nanniversary_date = datetime(2008, 1, 2)\n\n# Calculate the date 10 days before the anniversary\ndate_10_days_ago = anniversary_date - timedelta(days=10)\n\n# Format the date in MM/DD/YYYY\nformatted_date = date_10_days_ago.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the date 10 days before their golden wedding anniversary.",
    "The code execution result shows that the date 10 days before January 2, 2008, is December 23, 2007. This matches one of the options provided in the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) 12/23/2007 <<<answer>>>"
