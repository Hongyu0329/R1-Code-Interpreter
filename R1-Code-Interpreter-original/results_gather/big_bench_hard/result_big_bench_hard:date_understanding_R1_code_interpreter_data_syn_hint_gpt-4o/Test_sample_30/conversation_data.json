    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs and then calculate the date one week from that day.\n\n1. **Determine the date Jane ran out of eggs:**\n   - Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.\n   - She ate one egg per day.\n   - Therefore, she ran out of eggs 40 days after May 9th, 2017.\n\n2. **Calculate the date 40 days after May 9th, 2017:**\n   - May has 31 days. From May 9th to May 31st, there are 22 days.\n   - Therefore, 40 days after May 9th is 18 days into June (40 - 22 = 18).\n   - So, Jane ran out of eggs on June 18th, 2017.\n\n3. **Calculate the date one week from June 18th, 2017:**\n   - One week (7 days) after June 18th, 2017, is June 25th, 2017.\n\nNow, let's match this date with the given options:\n\n- (A) 06/25/1964\n- (B) 05/25/2018\n- (C) 06/24/2017\n- (D) 06/25/2063\n- (E) 06/25/2017\n- (F) 07/25/2017\n\nThe correct option is (E) 06/25/2017.\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) 06/25/2017 <<<answer>>>"
