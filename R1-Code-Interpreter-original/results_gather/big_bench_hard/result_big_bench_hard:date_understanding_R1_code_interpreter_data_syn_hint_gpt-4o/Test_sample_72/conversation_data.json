    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2001 and then calculate the date exactly one month before that.\n\n1. **Determine Thanksgiving Date in 2001:**\n   - Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November.\n   - In 2001, November 1st was a Thursday. Therefore, the Thursdays in November 2001 were on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th.\n   - The fourth Thursday was on November 22, 2001.\n\n2. **Calculate the Date One Month Before:**\n   - One month before November 22, 2001, is October 22, 2001.\n\nNow, let's check the options to find the correct answer:\n\n- (A) 11/22/2001: This is the date of Thanksgiving, not one month before.\n- (B) 10/21/2002: This is in the wrong year.\n- (C) 07/21/2002: This is in the wrong year and month.\n- (D) 10/22/1923: This is in the wrong year.\n- (E) 10/15/2002: This is in the wrong year and day.\n- (F) 10/22/2002: This is in the wrong year.\n\nThe correct date one month before Thanksgiving 2001 is not listed in the options. However, based on the calculation, the date should be 10/22/2001.\n\nSince none of the options match the correct date, it seems there might be an error in the options provided. However, based on the calculation, the correct date is October 22, 2001.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
