    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 0 \\times 0 \\times -1) - (7 + -1 + -3 \\times -2))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses**:\n   - The first part is \\((-8 + 0 \\times 0 \\times -1)\\). Here, \\(0 \\times 0 \\times -1 = 0\\), so the expression simplifies to \\(-8 + 0 = -8\\).\n   - The second part is \\((7 + -1 + -3 \\times -2)\\). Here, \\(-3 \\times -2 = 6\\), so the expression simplifies to \\(7 + -1 + 6\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part is already simplified to \\(-8\\).\n   - The second part becomes \\(7 + -1 + 6 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parts**:\n   - Now, we have \\((-8) - (12)\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (-8 + 0 * 0 * -1) - (7 + -1 + -3 * -2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
