    "To solve the expression \\((6 + 1 - 4 - 3) - (-4 \\times -6 \\times -3 + 1)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\(6 + 1 - 4 - 3\\).\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\(-4 \\times -6 \\times -3 + 1\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Within the second set of parentheses, perform the multiplication first.\n   - \\(-4 \\times -6 \\times -3\\).\n\n3. **Addition/Subtraction**: After solving the multiplication, perform the addition or subtraction within each set of parentheses.\n\n4. **Final Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the second set of parentheses from the result of the first set.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the first set of parentheses\nfirst_part = 6 + 1 - 4 - 3\n\n# Calculate the second set of parentheses\nsecond_part = (-4 * -6 * -3) + 1\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    ((6 + 1 - 4 - 3) - (-4 * -6 * -3 + 1)) =\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
