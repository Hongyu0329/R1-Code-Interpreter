    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 \\times -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 \\times -3 \\times 1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-9 \\times -5\\)\n   - \\(-6 \\times -3 \\times 1\\)\n\n2. **Simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n   - Calculate the results of the multiplications.\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction inside each set of parentheses.\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses expressions.**\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Evaluate the multiplications\npart1 = -9 * -5\npart2 = -6 * -3 * 1\n\n# Step 2: Simplify the expressions inside the parentheses\nexpr1 = part1 - 6 + -2\nexpr2 = -8 - part2\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the results of the two expressions\nresult = expr1 - expr2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
