    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 - 2 + 9 \\times -1) \\times (7 - 5 + 9 \\times -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\((-5 - 2 + 9 \\times -1)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(9 \\times -1 = -9\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\((-5 - 2 - 9)\\)\n     - Perform the operations from left to right: \\(-5 - 2 = -7\\), then \\(-7 - 9 = -16\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**:\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\((7 - 5 + 9 \\times -7)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(9 \\times -7 = -63\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\((7 - 5 - 63)\\)\n     - Perform the operations from left to right: \\(7 - 5 = 2\\), then \\(2 - 63 = -61\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\((-16) \\times (-61)\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the final multiplication using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = (-16) * (-61)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(((-5 - 2 + 9 \\times -1) \\times (7 - 5 + 9 \\times -7))\\) results in 976. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<976>>>"
