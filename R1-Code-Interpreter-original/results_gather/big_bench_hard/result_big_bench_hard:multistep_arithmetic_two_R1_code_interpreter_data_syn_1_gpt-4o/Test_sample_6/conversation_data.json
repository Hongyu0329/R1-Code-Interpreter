    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((1 - 0 + 1 - 4) - (-3 \\times 1 - -6 \\times -8))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\(1 - 0 + 1 - 4\\)\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\(-3 \\times 1 - -6 \\times -8\\)\n\n2. **Calculate each part**:\n   - For \\(1 - 0 + 1 - 4\\):\n     - \\(1 - 0 = 1\\)\n     - \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n     - \\(2 - 4 = -2\\)\n\n   - For \\(-3 \\times 1 - -6 \\times -8\\):\n     - \\(-3 \\times 1 = -3\\)\n     - \\(-6 \\times -8 = 48\\)\n     - \\(-3 - 48 = -51\\)\n\n3. **Substitute back into the main expression**:\n   - \\((-2) - (-51)\\)\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**:\n   - \\(-2 + 51 = 49\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = 1 - 0 + 1 - 4\npart2 = (-3 * 1) - (-6 * -8)\nresult = part1 - part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression is indeed 49. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<49>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
