    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 - 6 \\times 5 + -9) + (1 + -4 - -2 \\times 6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - In the first part: \\(-6 \\times 5 = -30\\)\n   - In the second part: \\(-2 \\times 6 = -12\\)\n\n2. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes: \\(((-5 - 30 + -9) + (1 + -4 - -12))\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate the expressions inside each set of parentheses:**\n   - First part: \\(-5 - 30 + -9 = -44\\)\n   - Second part: \\(1 + -4 - -12 = 1 - 4 + 12 = 9\\)\n\n4. **Add the results of the two parts together:**\n   - \\(-44 + 9 = -35\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -5 - 6 * 5 + -9\nsecond_part = 1 + -4 - -2 * 6\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression \\(((-5 - 6 \\times 5 + -9) + (1 + -4 - -2 \\times 6))\\) is \\(-35\\).\n\n<<<-35>>>"
