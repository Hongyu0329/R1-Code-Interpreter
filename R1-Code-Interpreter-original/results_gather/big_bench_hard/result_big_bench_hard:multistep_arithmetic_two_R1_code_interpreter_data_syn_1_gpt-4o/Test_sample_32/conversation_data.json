    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 + -2 \\times 1 - 6) + (3 + 9 \\times 7 + -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\(-7 + -2 \\times 1 - 6\\)\n     - Perform the multiplication: \\(-2 \\times 1 = -2\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(-7 + -2 - 6\\)\n     - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \n       - \\(-7 + -2 = -9\\)\n       - \\(-9 - 6 = -15\\)\n\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\(3 + 9 \\times 7 + -7\\)\n     - Perform the multiplication: \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(3 + 63 + -7\\)\n     - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n       - \\(3 + 63 = 66\\)\n       - \\(66 + -7 = 59\\)\n\n2. **Combine the results from both parentheses**:\n   - \\((-15) + (59)\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-15 + 59 = 44\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression using Python\nresult = ((-7 + -2 * 1 - 6) + (3 + 9 * 7 + -7))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result.",
