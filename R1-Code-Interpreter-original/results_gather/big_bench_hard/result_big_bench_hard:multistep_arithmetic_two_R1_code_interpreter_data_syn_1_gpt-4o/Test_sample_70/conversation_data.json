    "To solve the expression \\((0 \\times 9 + -8 \\times 7) - (7 - 9 + 1 + 0)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n   - For the first part: \\(0 \\times 9 + -8 \\times 7\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 9 = 0\\)\n     - \\(-8 \\times 7 = -56\\)\n     - So, \\(0 + (-56) = -56\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(7 - 9 + 1 + 0\\)\n     - \\(7 - 9 = -2\\)\n     - \\(-2 + 1 = -1\\)\n     - \\(-1 + 0 = -1\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parts:**\n   - \\(-56 - (-1)\\)\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive, so \\(-56 + 1 = -55\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (0 * 9 + -8 * 7) - (7 - 9 + 1 + 0)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
