    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nThe expression is:\n\n((-2 - 5 * -5 - 6) + (-5 * -4 + 2 + -2))\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: (-2 - 5 * -5 - 6)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: 5 * -5 = -25\n     - Substitute back into the expression: (-2 - (-25) - 6)\n     - Simplify: -2 + 25 - 6 = 17\n   - For the second set of parentheses: (-5 * -4 + 2 + -2)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: -5 * -4 = 20\n     - Substitute back into the expression: (20 + 2 - 2)\n     - Simplify: 20 + 2 - 2 = 20\n\n2. **Add the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - (17) + (20) = 37\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -2 - 5 * -5 - 6\nsecond_part = -5 * -4 + 2 + -2\nresult = first_part + second_part\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression is indeed 37. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<37>>>"
