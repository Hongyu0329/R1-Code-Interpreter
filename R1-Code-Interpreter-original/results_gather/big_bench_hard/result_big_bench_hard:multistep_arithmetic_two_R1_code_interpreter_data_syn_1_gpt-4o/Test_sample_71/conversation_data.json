    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8) + (6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8\\)\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3\\)\n\n2. **Perform multiplication and division first**:\n   - In the first set: \\(9 \\times 4 = 36\\)\n   - In the second set: \\(-4 \\times 3 = -12\\)\n\n3. **Substitute back into the expressions**:\n   - First set: \\(36 - 6 - -8\\)\n   - Second set: \\(6 - 8 - -12\\)\n\n4. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**:\n   - First set: \\(36 - 6 = 30\\), then \\(30 - -8 = 30 + 8 = 38\\)\n   - Second set: \\(6 - 8 = -2\\), then \\(-2 - -12 = -2 + 12 = 10\\)\n\n5. **Add the results of the two sets**:\n   - \\(38 + 10 = 48\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = 9 * 4 - 6 - -8\nsecond_part = 6 - 8 - -4 * 3\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the calculated result of the expression is correct. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8) + (6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3))\\) is:\n\n<<<48>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
