    "To solve the expression \\((5 \\times 1 \\times 3 - 9) \\times (-7 + 4 - -7 \\times -3)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part is \\(5 \\times 1 \\times 3 - 9\\).\n   - The second part is \\(-7 + 4 - -7 \\times -3\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the first part**:\n   - \\(5 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n   - \\(15 - 9 = 6\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the second part**:\n   - \\(-7 + 4 = -3\\).\n   - \\(-7 \\times -3 = 21\\).\n   - \\(-3 - 21 = -24\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\(6 \\times -24\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\npart1 = 5 * 1 * 3 - 9\npart2 = -7 + 4 - (-7 * -3)\nresult = part1 * part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
