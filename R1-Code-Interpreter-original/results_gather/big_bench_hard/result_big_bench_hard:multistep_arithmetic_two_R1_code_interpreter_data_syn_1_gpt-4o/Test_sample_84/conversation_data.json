    "To solve the expression \\((8 + 3 \\times -8 - -8) - (2 + 2 \\times -9 - 6)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(8 + 3 \\times -8 - -8\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(3 \\times -8 = -24\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(8 + (-24) - -8\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(8 - 24 + 8\\)\n     - Calculate: \\(8 - 24 = -16\\)\n     - Then: \\(-16 + 8 = -8\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(2 + 2 \\times -9 - 6\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(2 \\times -9 = -18\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(2 + (-18) - 6\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(2 - 18 - 6\\)\n     - Calculate: \\(2 - 18 = -16\\)\n     - Then: \\(-16 - 6 = -22\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - \\((-8) - (-22)\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(-8 + 22\\)\n   - Calculate: \\(22 - 8 = 14\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = 8 + 3 * -8 - -8\nsecond_part = 2 + 2 * -9 - 6\nresult = first_part - second_part\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The calculation has been verified, and the result of the expression \\((8 + 3 \\times -8 - -8) - (2 + 2 \\times -9 - 6)\\) is indeed 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
