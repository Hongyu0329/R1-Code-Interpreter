    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 + 8 - -4 * 2) - (1 - 9 + -6 * 3))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\((-9 + 8 - -4 * 2)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-4 * 2 = -8\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(-9 + 8 - (-8)\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(-9 + 8 + 8 = 7\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\((1 - 9 + -6 * 3)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-6 * 3 = -18\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(1 - 9 - 18\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(1 - 9 - 18 = -26\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - \\(7 - (-26)\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(7 + 26 = 33\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -9 + 8 - (-4 * 2)\nsecond_part = 1 - 9 + (-6 * 3)\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the calculated result of the expression \\(((-9 + 8 - -4 * 2) - (1 - 9 + -6 * 3))\\) is indeed correct.\n\n<<<33>>>"
