    "To solve the expression \\(((7 - 4 + -3 * 4) - (5 + -8 - 6 + -5))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   - \\(7 - 4 + (-3) \\times 4\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\((-3) \\times 4 = -12\\)\n   - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(7 - 4 - 12\\)\n   - \\(7 - 4 = 3\\)\n   - \\(3 - 12 = -9\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   - \\(5 + (-8) - 6 + (-5)\\)\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   - \\(5 - 8 = -3\\)\n   - \\(-3 - 6 = -9\\)\n   - \\(-9 - 5 = -14\\)\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses:**\n   - \\((-9) - (-14)\\)\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive: \\(-9 + 14 = 5\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = ((7 - 4 + (-3) * 4) - (5 + (-8) - 6 + (-5)))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
