    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate each part of the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-6 \\times -1 - 2 + -2) + (9 - 4 + -1 - 7))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate the first part**: \\((-6 \\times -1 - 2 + -2)\\)\n   - \\(-6 \\times -1 = 6\\)\n   - \\(6 - 2 = 4\\)\n   - \\(4 + -2 = 2\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part**: \\((9 - 4 + -1 - 7)\\)\n   - \\(9 - 4 = 5\\)\n   - \\(5 + -1 = 4\\)\n   - \\(4 - 7 = -3\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results**: \\((2) + (-3)\\)\n   - \\(2 + (-3) = -1\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = (-6 * -1 - 2 + -2)\nsecond_part = (9 - 4 + -1 - 7)\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<-1>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches our manual calculation. Therefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
