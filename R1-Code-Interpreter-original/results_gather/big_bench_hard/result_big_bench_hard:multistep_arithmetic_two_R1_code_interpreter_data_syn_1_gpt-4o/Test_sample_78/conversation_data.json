    "To solve the given expression, we need to carefully evaluate each part of the expression step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve expressions inside parentheses first.\n2. **Exponents**: Evaluate powers and roots.\n3. **Multiplication and Division**: From left to right.\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: From left to right.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((5 - -2 \\times -9 + 8) - (3 - 4 \\times -3 - -6))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Inner Parentheses**:\n   - First part: \\(5 - -2 \\times -9 + 8\\)\n   - Second part: \\(3 - 4 \\times -3 - -6\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate Multiplication**:\n   - In the first part: \\(-2 \\times -9 = 18\\)\n   - In the second part: \\(4 \\times -3 = -12\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Part**:\n   - First part: \\(5 - 18 + 8\\)\n   - Second part: \\(3 - (-12) - (-6)\\)\n\n4. **Simplify Each Part**:\n   - First part: \\(5 - 18 + 8 = -5\\)\n   - Second part: \\(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\\)\n\n5. **Final Subtraction**:\n   - \\((-5) - (21) = -26\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the expression\nresult = ((5 - (-2) * (-9) + 8) - (3 - 4 * (-3) - (-6)))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
