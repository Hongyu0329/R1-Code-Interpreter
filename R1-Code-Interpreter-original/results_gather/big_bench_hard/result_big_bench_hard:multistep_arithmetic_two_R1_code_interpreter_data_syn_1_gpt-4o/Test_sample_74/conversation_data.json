    "To solve the given expression, we need to break it down into smaller parts and evaluate each part step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-3 - -6 - -7 + 3) + (5 \\times 5 \\times 1 - -3))\n\\]\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n\n1. **Evaluate the first part: \\((-3 - -6 - -7 + 3)\\)**\n   - \\(-3 - -6\\) is equivalent to \\(-3 + 6 = 3\\)\n   - \\(3 - -7\\) is equivalent to \\(3 + 7 = 10\\)\n   - \\(10 + 3 = 13\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part: \\((5 \\times 5 \\times 1 - -3)\\)**\n   - \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n   - \\(25 \\times 1 = 25\\)\n   - \\(25 - -3\\) is equivalent to \\(25 + 3 = 28\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parts:**\n   - \\(13 + 28 = 41\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (-3 + 6 + 7 + 3)\npart2 = (5 * 5 * 1 + 3)\nresult = part1 + part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
