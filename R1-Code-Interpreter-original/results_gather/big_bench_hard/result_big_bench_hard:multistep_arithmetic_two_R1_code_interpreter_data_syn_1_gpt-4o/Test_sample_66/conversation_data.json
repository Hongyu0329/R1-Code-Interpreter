    "To solve the expression \\((4 + 5 \\times -9 \\times -8) - (-9 + -7 - -6 - -9)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(5 \\times -9 = -45\\)\n   - \\(-45 \\times -8 = 360\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the first part of the expression:**\n   - \\(4 + 360 = 364\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate the second part of the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-9 + -7 = -16\\)\n   - \\(-16 - -6 = -16 + 6 = -10\\)\n   - \\(-10 - -9 = -10 + 9 = -1\\)\n\n4. **Subtract the second part from the first part:**\n   - \\(364 - (-1) = 364 + 1 = 365\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = 4 + 5 * -9 * -8\nsecond_part = -9 + -7 - -6 - -9\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
