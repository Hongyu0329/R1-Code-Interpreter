    "To solve the given expression, we need to carefully evaluate each part of the expression step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-6 - -1 - -5 \\times -5) + (8 + -5 - 9 \\times -7))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost operations:**\n   - \\(-5 \\times -5\\) and \\(9 \\times -7\\).\n\n2. **Substitute these results back into the expression:**\n   - Replace \\(-5 \\times -5\\) with its result.\n   - Replace \\(9 \\times -7\\) with its result.\n\n3. **Evaluate the remaining operations inside the parentheses.**\n\n4. **Finally, add the results of the two main parts of the expression.**\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -6 - (-1) - (-5 * -5)\npart2 = 8 + (-5) - (9 * -7)\n\n# Final result\nresult = part1 + part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is 36. \n\nLet's break down the steps to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(-5 \\times -5\\):** \n   - This results in \\(-25\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(9 \\times -7\\):** \n   - This results in \\(-63\\).\n\n3. **Substitute these results back into the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes \\((-6 - (-1) - (-25)) + (8 + (-5) - (-63))\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the first part:**\n   - \\(-6 - (-1) = -6 + 1 = -5\\).\n   - \\(-5 - (-25) = -5 + 25 = 20\\).\n\n5. **Evaluate the second part:**\n   - \\(8 + (-5) = 8 - 5 = 3\\).\n   - \\(3 - (-63) = 3 + 63 = 66\\).\n\n6. **Add the results of the two parts:**\n   - \\(20 + 66 = 86\\).\n\nIt seems there was a mistake in the initial reasoning, and the correct result should be 86, not 36. \n\n<<<86>>>"
