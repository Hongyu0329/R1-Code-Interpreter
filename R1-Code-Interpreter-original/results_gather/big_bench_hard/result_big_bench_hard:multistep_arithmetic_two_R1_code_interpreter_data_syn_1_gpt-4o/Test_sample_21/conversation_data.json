    "To solve the expression \\((8 \\times -6 + 6 \\times 1) - (-3 \\times 7 \\times 0 - 7)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(8 \\times -6 = -48\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n   - \\(-3 \\times 7 \\times 0 = 0\\) (since any number multiplied by zero is zero)\n\n2. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\((-3 \\times 7 \\times 0 - 7) = (0 - 7) = -7\\)\n\n3. **Substitute back into the main expression:**\n   - \\((-48 + 6) - (-7)\\)\n\n4. **Perform the addition and subtraction:**\n   - \\(-48 + 6 = -42\\)\n   - \\(-42 - (-7) = -42 + 7 = -35\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = (8 * -6 + 6 * 1) - (-3 * 7 * 0 - 7)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
