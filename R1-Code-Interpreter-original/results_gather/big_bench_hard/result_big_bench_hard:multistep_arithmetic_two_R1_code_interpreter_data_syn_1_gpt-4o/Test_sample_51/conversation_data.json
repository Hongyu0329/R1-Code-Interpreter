    "To solve the expression \\(((-3 - 8 \\times 5 + 5) - (-1 \\times -3 - -2 - 6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n   - \\(-1 \\times -3 = 3\\)\n\n2. **Substitute these values back into the expression:**\n   - \\((-3 - 40 + 5) - (3 - -2 - 6)\\)\n\n3. **Simplify inside the parentheses:**\n   - First part: \\(-3 - 40 + 5 = -38\\)\n   - Second part: \\(3 - -2 - 6 = 3 + 2 - 6 = -1\\)\n\n4. **Substitute these simplified values back into the expression:**\n   - \\(-38 - (-1)\\)\n\n5. **Simplify the final expression:**\n   - \\(-38 + 1 = -37\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the expression\nresult = ((-3 - 8 * 5 + 5) - (-1 * -3 - -2 - 6))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
