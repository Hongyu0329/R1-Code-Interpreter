    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 - -7 + 5 * -3) + (2 - 8 + 5 * -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(-2 - -7 + 5 * -3\\)\n     - \\(-2 - -7\\) is equivalent to \\(-2 + 7\\), which equals 5.\n     - \\(5 * -3\\) equals \\(-15\\).\n     - So, the first part simplifies to \\(5 - 15\\), which equals \\(-10\\).\n\n   - The second part: \\(2 - 8 + 5 * -7\\)\n     - \\(5 * -7\\) equals \\(-35\\).\n     - \\(2 - 8\\) equals \\(-6\\).\n     - So, the second part simplifies to \\(-6 - 35\\), which equals \\(-41\\).\n\n2. **Combine the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\((-10) + (-41)\\) equals \\(-51\\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (-2 - -7 + 5 * -3)\npart2 = (2 - 8 + 5 * -7)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final answer.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The expression evaluates to \\(-51\\).\n\n<<<-51>>>"
