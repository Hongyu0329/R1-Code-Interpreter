    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n   - The expression inside the first parentheses is: \\(0 - -1 + -1 + -3\\)\n   - The expression inside the second parentheses is: \\(-3 * 0 * 8 + 6\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the first parentheses**: \n   - \\(0 - -1\\) is equivalent to \\(0 + 1 = 1\\)\n   - \\(1 + -1 = 0\\)\n   - \\(0 + -3 = -3\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate the second parentheses**:\n   - \\(-3 * 0 = 0\\)\n   - \\(0 * 8 = 0\\)\n   - \\(0 + 6 = 6\\)\n\n4. **Substitute the evaluated parentheses back into the expression**:\n   - The expression becomes: \\((-3) - (6)\\)\n\n5. **Final calculation**:\n   - \\(-3 - 6 = -9\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_parentheses = 0 - -1 + -1 + -3\nsecond_parentheses = -3 * 0 * 8 + 6\nresult = (first_parentheses) - (second_parentheses)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression is \\(-9\\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-9>>>"
