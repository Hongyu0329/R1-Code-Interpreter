    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate each part of the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-9 - -7 + 2 + 2) + (-7 + -9 - -1 - 0))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Evaluate the first part: \\((-9 - -7 + 2 + 2)\\)\n   - \\(-9 - -7\\) is equivalent to \\(-9 + 7\\), which equals \\(-2\\).\n   - Adding 2: \\(-2 + 2 = 0\\).\n   - Adding another 2: \\(0 + 2 = 2\\).\n\n2. Evaluate the second part: \\((-7 + -9 - -1 - 0)\\)\n   - \\(-7 + -9\\) is \\(-16\\).\n   - \\(-16 - -1\\) is equivalent to \\(-16 + 1\\), which equals \\(-15\\).\n   - Subtracting 0: \\(-15 - 0 = -15\\).\n\n3. Combine the results from both parts: \\(2 + (-15)\\)\n   - This equals \\(-13\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (-9 - -7 + 2 + 2)\npart2 = (-7 + -9 - -1 - 0)\nresult = part1 + part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of the expression \\(((-9 - -7 + 2 + 2) + (-7 + -9 - -1 - 0))\\) is \\(-13\\).\n\n<<<-13>>>"
