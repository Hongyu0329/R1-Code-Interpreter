    "To solve the expression \\((5 - 6 - 7 + 6) - (-1 - 1 \\times -7 + 9)\\), we need to evaluate each part of the expression step by step.\n\n1. Evaluate the first part: \\(5 - 6 - 7 + 6\\).\n2. Evaluate the second part: \\(-1 - 1 \\times -7 + 9\\).\n3. Subtract the result of the second part from the result of the first part.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- For the first part: \\(5 - 6 - 7 + 6\\)\n  - \\(5 - 6 = -1\\)\n  - \\(-1 - 7 = -8\\)\n  - \\(-8 + 6 = -2\\)\n\n- For the second part: \\(-1 - 1 \\times -7 + 9\\)\n  - \\(1 \\times -7 = -7\\)\n  - \\(-1 - (-7) = -1 + 7 = 6\\)\n  - \\(6 + 9 = 15\\)\n\nNow, subtract the second part from the first part:\n- \\((-2) - 15 = -17\\)\n\nLet's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nfirst_part = 5 - 6 - 7 + 6\nsecond_part = -1 - 1 * -7 + 9\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
