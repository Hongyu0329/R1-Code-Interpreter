    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.\n2. **Exponents**: Evaluate exponents (not applicable here).\n3. **Multiplication and Division**: Evaluate from left to right.\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Evaluate from left to right.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-6 - -4 + 9 + 0) + (1 + -4 - -9 \\times 6))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **First Parentheses**: \\((-6 - -4 + 9 + 0)\\)\n   - \\(-6 - -4\\) is equivalent to \\(-6 + 4 = -2\\)\n   - \\(-2 + 9 = 7\\)\n   - \\(7 + 0 = 7\\)\n\n2. **Second Parentheses**: \\((1 + -4 - -9 \\times 6)\\)\n   - \\(-9 \\times 6 = -54\\)\n   - \\(-4 - -54\\) is equivalent to \\(-4 + 54 = 50\\)\n   - \\(1 + 50 = 51\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results**: \\(7 + 51 = 58\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = (-6 - -4 + 9 + 0)\nsecond_part = (1 + -4 - -9 * 6)\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    ((-6 - -4 + 9 + 0) + (1 + -4 - -9 * 6)) =\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
