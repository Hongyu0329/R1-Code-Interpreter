    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 5 - 0 - 6) * (-5 * -4 - 6 + -3))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\(-8 + 5 - 0 - 6\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\(-5 * -4 - 6 + -3\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two evaluated expressions.**\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **First Parentheses:**\n   \\(-8 + 5 - 0 - 6\\)\n   - Calculate \\(-8 + 5 = -3\\)\n   - Then \\(-3 - 0 = -3\\)\n   - Finally \\(-3 - 6 = -9\\)\n\n2. **Second Parentheses:**\n   \\(-5 * -4 - 6 + -3\\)\n   - Calculate \\(-5 * -4 = 20\\)\n   - Then \\(20 - 6 = 14\\)\n   - Finally \\(14 + -3 = 11\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results:**\n   \\(-9 * 11\\)\n\nNow, let's compute the final multiplication using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_parentheses = -8 + 5 - 0 - 6\nsecond_parentheses = (-5 * -4) - 6 + -3\nresult = first_parentheses * second_parentheses\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
