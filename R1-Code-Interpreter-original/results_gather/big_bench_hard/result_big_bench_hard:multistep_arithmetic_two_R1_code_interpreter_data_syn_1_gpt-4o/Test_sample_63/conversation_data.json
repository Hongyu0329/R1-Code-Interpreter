    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. **Parentheses/Brackets**: Solve expressions inside parentheses first.\n2. **Exponents/Orders**: Not applicable here.\n3. **Multiplication and Division**: From left to right.\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: From left to right.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. Evaluate the multiplication inside the first set of parentheses: \\(-6 * -1\\).\n2. Add the results of the operations inside each set of parentheses.\n3. Finally, add the results of the two sets of parentheses together.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Evaluate the expression step by step\npart1 = -5 + 6 + (-6 * -1)\npart2 = -5 + -5 + 9 + -2\nresult = part1 + part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is 4. \n\nLet's summarize the steps:\n\n1. **First Parentheses**: \n   - \\(-6 * -1 = 6\\)\n   - \\(-5 + 6 + 6 = 7\\)\n\n2. **Second Parentheses**:\n   - \\(-5 + -5 + 9 + -2 = -3\\)\n\n3. **Final Addition**:\n   - \\(7 + (-3) = 4\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
