    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 6 \\times -2 + 4) \\times (-4 \\times 5 + 2 - 8))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\(-8 + 6 \\times -2 + 4\\)\n     - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(6 \\times -2 = -12\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(-8 - 12 + 4\\)\n     - \\(-8 - 12 = -20\\)\n     - \\(-20 + 4 = -16\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(-4 \\times 5 + 2 - 8\\)\n     - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(-4 \\times 5 = -20\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(-20 + 2 - 8\\)\n     - \\(-20 + 2 = -18\\)\n     - \\(-18 - 8 = -26\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two evaluated parts**:\n   - \\((-16) \\times (-26)\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the final multiplication using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final multiplication\nresult = (-16) * (-26)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
