    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 \\times -9 + 8 \\times -3) \\times (5 + -7 - 4 \\times -5))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\((-7 \\times -9 + 8 \\times -3)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-7 \\times -9\\)\n     - Calculate \\(8 \\times -3\\)\n     - Add the results of the two calculations.\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\((5 + -7 - 4 \\times -5)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-4 \\times -5\\)\n     - Add and subtract the results with 5 and -7.\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**.\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the first part of the expression\npart1 = (-7 * -9) + (8 * -3)\n\n# Calculate the second part of the expression\npart2 = 5 + (-7) - (4 * -5)\n\n# Multiply the results of the two parts\nresult = part1 * part2\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
