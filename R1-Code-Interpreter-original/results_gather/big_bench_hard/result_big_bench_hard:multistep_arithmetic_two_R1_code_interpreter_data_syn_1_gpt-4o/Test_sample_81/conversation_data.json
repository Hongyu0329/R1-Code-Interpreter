    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: We need to solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n   - The first part is \\((-8 + -4 \\times -9 \\times 0)\\).\n   - The second part is \\((2 \\times -9 + 3 \\times -3)\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Within each set of parentheses, perform the multiplication first.\n   - For \\((-8 + -4 \\times -9 \\times 0)\\):\n     - \\(-4 \\times -9 \\times 0 = 0\\) (since any number multiplied by 0 is 0).\n   - For \\((2 \\times -9 + 3 \\times -3)\\):\n     - \\(2 \\times -9 = -18\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times -3 = -9\\)\n\n3. **Addition/Subtraction**: After handling multiplication, perform addition and subtraction.\n   - For \\((-8 + 0)\\):\n     - \\(-8 + 0 = -8\\)\n   - For \\((-18 + -9)\\):\n     - \\(-18 + -9 = -27\\)\n\n4. **Final Addition**: Combine the results from the two parts.\n   - \\((-8) + (-27) = -35\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -8 + (-4 * -9 * 0)\npart2 = (2 * -9) + (3 * -3)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the final result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the calculated result of the expression is correct. Therefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((-8 + -4 \\times -9 \\times 0) + (2 \\times -9 + 3 \\times -3))\\) is:\n\n<<<-35>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
