    "To solve the given expression, we need to break it down into smaller parts and evaluate each part step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(3 \\times 9 - 3 \\times 2) + (-1 \\times -7 - 1 - -9)\n\\]\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n\n1. **First Part: \\(3 \\times 9 - 3 \\times 2\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 9\\)\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 2\\)\n   - Subtract the second result from the first\n\n2. **Second Part: \\(-1 \\times -7 - 1 - -9\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(-1 \\times -7\\)\n   - Subtract 1 from the result\n   - Subtract \\(-9\\) (which is equivalent to adding 9)\n\nFinally, add the results of the first and second parts together.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# First part\nfirst_part = (3 * 9) - (3 * 2)\n\n# Second part\nsecond_part = (-1 * -7) - 1 - (-9)\n\n# Final result\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 36. This means the evaluated expression results in 36.\n\nThe breakdown of the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. **First Part: \\(3 \\times 9 - 3 \\times 2\\)**\n   - \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n   - \\(27 - 6 = 21\\)\n\n2. **Second Part: \\(-1 \\times -7 - 1 - -9\\)**\n   - \\(-1 \\times -7 = 7\\)\n   - \\(7 - 1 = 6\\)\n   - \\(6 - (-9) = 6 + 9 = 15\\)\n\n3. **Final Result:**\n   - \\(21 + 15 = 36\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<36>>>"
