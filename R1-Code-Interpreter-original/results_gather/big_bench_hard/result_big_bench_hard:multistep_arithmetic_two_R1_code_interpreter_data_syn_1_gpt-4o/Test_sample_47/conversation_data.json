    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 - -3 \\times 1 - -3) \\times (-9 - 5 - -2 \\times -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(-9 - (-3 \\times 1) - (-3)\\)\n   - The second part: \\(-9 - 5 - (-2 \\times -7)\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(-3 \\times 1 = -3\\)\n   - \\(-2 \\times -7 = 14\\)\n\n3. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - First part: \\(-9 - (-3) - (-3)\\)\n   - Second part: \\(-9 - 5 - 14\\)\n\n4. **Simplify further**:\n   - First part: \\(-9 + 3 + 3 = -3\\)\n   - Second part: \\(-9 - 5 - 14 = -28\\)\n\n5. **Multiply the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\((-3) \\times (-28)\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the final multiplication to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final result\nfirst_part = -9 + 3 + 3\nsecond_part = -9 - 5 - 14\nresult = first_part * second_part\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the result of the expression \\(((-9 - -3 \\times 1 - -3) \\times (-9 - 5 - -2 \\times -7))\\) is 84. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<84>>>"
