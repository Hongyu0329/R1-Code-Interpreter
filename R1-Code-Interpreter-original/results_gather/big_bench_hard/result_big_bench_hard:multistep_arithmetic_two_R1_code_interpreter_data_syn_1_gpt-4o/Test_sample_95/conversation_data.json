    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 2) \\times (-9 - 1 \\times -9 \\times 3))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\((-8 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 2)\\)\n     - \\(-8 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n     - So, the expression becomes \\(0 + 4 = 4\\).\n\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\((-9 - 1 \\times -9 \\times 3)\\)\n     - \\(-1 \\times -9 = 9\\)\n     - \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n     - So, the expression becomes \\(-9 - 27 = -36\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Now multiply the results of the two parentheses.\n   - \\(4 \\times -36 = -144\\)\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = (-8 * 0 + 2 * 2)\nsecond_part = (-9 - 1 * -9 * 3)\nresult = first_part * second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "It seems there was an error in my manual calculation. Let's go through the steps again to identify the mistake:\n\n1. **First Part**: \\((-8 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 2)\\)\n   - \\(-8 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n   - So, the first part is \\(0 + 4 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Second Part**: \\((-9 - 1 \\times -9 \\times 3)\\)\n   - \\(-1 \\times -9 = 9\\)\n   - \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n   - So, the second part is \\(-9 - 27 = -36\\).\n\n3. **Multiplication**: \\(4 \\times -36 = -144\\)\n\nHowever, the code output is 72, which indicates a mistake in my manual calculation. Let's re-evaluate the second part:\n\n- The correct calculation for the second part should be:\n  - \\(-1 \\times -9 = 9\\)\n  - \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n  - \\(-9 - 27 = -36\\) is incorrect. It should be \\(-9 + 27 = 18\\).\n\nThus, the correct multiplication is:\n- \\(4 \\times 18 = 72\\)\n\nThe code output is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<72>>>"
