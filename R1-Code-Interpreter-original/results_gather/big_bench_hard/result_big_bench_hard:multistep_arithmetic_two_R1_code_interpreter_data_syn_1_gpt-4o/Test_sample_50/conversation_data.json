    "To solve the expression \\((4 - 3 \\times -1 \\times 3) \\times (3 + 8 + 1 - 7)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(4 - 3 \\times -1 \\times 3\\)\n     - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(-1 \\times 3 = -3\\)\n     - Then, calculate the next multiplication: \\(3 \\times -3 = -9\\)\n     - Finally, perform the subtraction: \\(4 - (-9) = 4 + 9 = 13\\)\n\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(3 + 8 + 1 - 7\\)\n     - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \n       - \\(3 + 8 = 11\\)\n       - \\(11 + 1 = 12\\)\n       - \\(12 - 7 = 5\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\(13 \\times 5\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (4 - 3 * -1 * 3) * (3 + 8 + 1 - 7)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\((4 - 3 \\times -1 \\times 3) \\times (3 + 8 + 1 - 7)\\) results in 65. \n\nThe steps were as follows:\n- The first part of the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to 13.\n- The second part of the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to 5.\n- Multiplying these results gives \\(13 \\times 5 = 65\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<65>>>"
