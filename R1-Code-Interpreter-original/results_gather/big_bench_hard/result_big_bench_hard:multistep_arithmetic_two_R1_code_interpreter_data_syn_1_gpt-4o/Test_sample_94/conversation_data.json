    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 + 5 \\times -6 \\times -6) \\times (7 \\times -5 + -6 - 7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expressions first:**\n   - Calculate \\(5 \\times -6 \\times -6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(7 \\times -5\\).\n\n2. **Substitute these results back into the expression:**\n   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n3. **Evaluate the entire expression:**\n   - Multiply the results of the simplified expressions.\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the innermost expressions\ninner1 = 5 * -6 * -6\ninner2 = 7 * -5\n\n# Step 2: Substitute these results back into the expression\npart1 = -7 + inner1\npart2 = inner2 + -6 - 7\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the entire expression\nresult = part1 * part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
