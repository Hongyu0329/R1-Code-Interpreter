    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 + -2 * 3 * 0) + (3 + -4 - 7 - -4))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: We have two sets of parentheses in the expression. We will evaluate each separately.\n\n2. **Multiplication inside the first parentheses**: \n   - \\(-2 * 3 * 0\\) results in \\(0\\) because any number multiplied by zero is zero.\n   - So, the first part becomes \\(-6 + 0\\).\n\n3. **Addition inside the first parentheses**:\n   - \\(-6 + 0 = -6\\).\n\n4. **Second set of parentheses**:\n   - \\(3 + -4 - 7 - -4\\).\n   - We will evaluate this from left to right.\n\n5. **Addition and Subtraction inside the second parentheses**:\n   - \\(3 + -4 = -1\\).\n   - \\(-1 - 7 = -8\\).\n   - \\(-8 - -4 = -8 + 4 = -4\\).\n\n6. **Combine the results of both parentheses**:\n   - \\((-6) + (-4)\\).\n\n7. **Final Addition**:\n   - \\(-6 + -4 = -10\\).\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = (-6 + (-2 * 3 * 0)) + (3 + -4 - 7 - -4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
