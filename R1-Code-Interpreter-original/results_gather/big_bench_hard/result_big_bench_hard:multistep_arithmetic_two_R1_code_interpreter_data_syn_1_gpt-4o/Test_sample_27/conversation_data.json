    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\( (9 - 3 + 2 + -1) \\)\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\( (5 - -1 - -6 * -4) \\)\n\n2. **Inside the first parentheses**: \n   - \\( 9 - 3 = 6 \\)\n   - \\( 6 + 2 = 8 \\)\n   - \\( 8 + -1 = 7 \\)\n\n3. **Inside the second parentheses**:\n   - Handle the multiplication first: \\( -6 * -4 = 24 \\)\n   - Then, \\( 5 - -1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \\)\n   - Finally, \\( 6 - 24 = -18 \\)\n\n4. **Substitute the results back into the main expression**:\n   - \\( (7) - (-18) \\)\n\n5. **Final calculation**:\n   - \\( 7 - (-18) = 7 + 18 = 25 \\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_parentheses = (9 - 3 + 2 + -1)\nsecond_parentheses = (5 - -1 - -6 * -4)\n\n# Final expression calculation\nresult = first_parentheses - second_parentheses\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the calculated result of the expression is correct. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) - (5 - -1 - -6 * -4)\\) is:\n\n<<<25>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
