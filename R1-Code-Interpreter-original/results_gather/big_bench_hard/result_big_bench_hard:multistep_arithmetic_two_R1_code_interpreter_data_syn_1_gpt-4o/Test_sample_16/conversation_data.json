    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((8 + 9 - 4 - -9) + (8 + 7 - 6 \\times 1))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first set: \\(8 + 9 - 4 - -9\\)\n     - \\(8 + 9 = 17\\)\n     - \\(17 - 4 = 13\\)\n     - \\(13 - -9 = 13 + 9 = 22\\)\n\n   - For the second set: \\(8 + 7 - 6 \\times 1\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n     - \\(8 + 7 = 15\\)\n     - \\(15 - 6 = 9\\)\n\n2. **Add the results of the two sets:**\n\n   - \\(22 + 9 = 31\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = 8 + 9 - 4 - (-9)\nsecond_part = 8 + 7 - 6 * 1\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
