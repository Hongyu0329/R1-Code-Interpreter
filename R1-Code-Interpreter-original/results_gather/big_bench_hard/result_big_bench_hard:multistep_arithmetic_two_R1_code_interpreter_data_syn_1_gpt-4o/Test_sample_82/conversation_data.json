    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 6 - 8 \\times -9) - (9 - 9 \\times -2 + -1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\(-8 + 6 - 8 \\times -9\\)\n   - For the second part: \\(9 - 9 \\times -2 + -1\\)\n\n2. **Perform multiplication**:\n   - In the first part: \\(-8 \\times -9 = 72\\)\n   - In the second part: \\(9 \\times -2 = -18\\)\n\n3. **Substitute the results back into the expressions**:\n   - First part becomes: \\(-8 + 6 + 72\\)\n   - Second part becomes: \\(9 + 18 - 1\\)\n\n4. **Perform addition and subtraction**:\n   - First part: \\(-8 + 6 + 72 = 70\\)\n   - Second part: \\(9 + 18 - 1 = 26\\)\n\n5. **Subtract the second part from the first part**:\n   - \\(70 - 26\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -8 + 6 - 8 * -9\nsecond_part = 9 - 9 * -2 + -1\nresult = first_part - second_part\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
