    "To solve the expression \\(((-1 + -6 - -4 + -6) - (-2 * -5 - -1 * 1))\\), we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. Simplify the terms inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-1 + -6 - -4 + -6)\\).\n2. Simplify the terms inside the second set of parentheses: \\((-2 * -5 - -1 * 1)\\).\n3. Subtract the result of the second set of parentheses from the result of the first set.\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code for accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Simplify the first set of parentheses\nfirst_part = (-1 + -6 - -4 + -6)\n\n# Step 2: Simplify the second set of parentheses\nsecond_part = (-2 * -5 - -1 * 1)\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the second part from the first part\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
