    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: We first solve the expressions within the parentheses.\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\(1 + 3 - -5 - 4\\)\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\(-3 - -3 + 6 * 9\\)\n\n2. **Solve the first set of parentheses**: \n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(4 - -5 = 4 + 5 = 9\\)\n   - \\(9 - 4 = 5\\)\n\n3. **Solve the second set of parentheses**:\n   - \\(-3 - -3 = -3 + 3 = 0\\)\n   - \\(0 + 6 * 9\\)\n   - According to PEMDAS, we perform multiplication before addition:\n   - \\(6 * 9 = 54\\)\n   - \\(0 + 54 = 54\\)\n\n4. **Combine the results of the parentheses**:\n   - \\(5 + 54 = 59\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = 1 + 3 - (-5) - 4\nsecond_part = (-3) - (-3) + 6 * 9\nresult = first_part + second_part\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression is correct. Therefore, the final answer to the expression \\((1 + 3 - -5 - 4) + (-3 - -3 + 6 * 9)\\) is:\n\n<<<59>>>"
