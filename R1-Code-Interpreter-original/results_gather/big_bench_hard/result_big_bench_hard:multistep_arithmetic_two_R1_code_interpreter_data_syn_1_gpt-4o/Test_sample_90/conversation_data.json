    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 - 2 \\times 2 + 0) - (7 - 6 - -7 - -1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\(-2 - 2 \\times 2 + 0\\)\n   - The multiplication \\(2 \\times 2\\) results in 4.\n   - So, the expression becomes \\(-2 - 4 + 0\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the subtraction and addition inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   - \\(-2 - 4\\) results in \\(-6\\).\n   - \\(-6 + 0\\) results in \\(-6\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the operations inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\(7 - 6 - -7 - -1\\)\n   - The expression can be rewritten as \\(7 - 6 + 7 + 1\\) because subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding.\n   - \\(7 - 6\\) results in 1.\n   - \\(1 + 7\\) results in 8.\n   - \\(8 + 1\\) results in 9.\n\n4. **Subtract the results of the two sets of parentheses:**\n   \\((-6) - (9)\\)\n   - This results in \\(-6 - 9\\), which is \\(-15\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = ((-2 - 2 * 2 + 0) - (7 - 6 - -7 - -1))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of the expression \\(((-2 - 2 \\times 2 + 0) - (7 - 6 - -7 - -1))\\) is \\(-15\\).\n\n<<<-15>>>"
