    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expressions inside the parentheses.\n2. **Exponents**: There are no exponents in this expression.\n3. **Multiplication and Division**: From left to right.\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: From left to right.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. Evaluate the first set of parentheses: \\((-8 + -6 * 9 - 7)\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-6 * 9 = -54\\)\n   - Substitute back: \\((-8 + -54 - 7)\\)\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(-8 + -54 = -62\\), then \\(-62 - 7 = -69\\)\n\n2. Evaluate the second set of parentheses: \\((8 + 2 * -9 * -7)\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(2 * -9 = -18\\), then \\(-18 * -7 = 126\\)\n   - Substitute back: \\((8 + 126)\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(8 + 126 = 134\\)\n\n3. Combine the results of the two parentheses: \\((-69) + (134)\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-69 + 134 = 65\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -8 + (-6 * 9) - 7\nsecond_part = 8 + (2 * -9 * -7)\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of the expression \\(((-8 + -6 * 9 - 7) + (8 + 2 * -9 * -7))\\) is 65.\n\n<<<65>>>"
