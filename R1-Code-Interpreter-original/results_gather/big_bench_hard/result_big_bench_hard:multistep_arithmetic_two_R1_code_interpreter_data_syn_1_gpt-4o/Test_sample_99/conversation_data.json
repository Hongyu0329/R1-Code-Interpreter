    "To solve the given expression, we need to break it down into smaller parts and evaluate each part step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-6 \\times -4 + -1 + 1) + (-9 \\times -6 + 7 + 9))\n\\]\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n\n1. **First Part: \\((-6 \\times -4 + -1 + 1)\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(-6 \\times -4\\)\n   - Add \\(-1\\)\n   - Add \\(1\\)\n\n2. **Second Part: \\((-9 \\times -6 + 7 + 9)\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(-9 \\times -6\\)\n   - Add \\(7\\)\n   - Add \\(9\\)\n\nFinally, add the results of the first and second parts together.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# First part calculation\nfirst_part = (-6 * -4) + (-1) + 1\n\n# Second part calculation\nsecond_part = (-9 * -6) + 7 + 9\n\n# Total result\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
