    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((6 \\times -6 \\times 8 \\times 1) \\times (-1 \\times 7 \\times -6 + -2))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times -6 \\times 8 \\times 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -1 \\times 7 \\times -6 + -2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses.**\n\nLet's compute these step by step using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Evaluate the first set of parentheses\nfirst_part = 6 * -6 * 8 * 1\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate the second set of parentheses\nsecond_part = (-1 * 7 * -6) + (-2)\n\n# Step 3: Multiply the results of the two parts\nresult = first_part * second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
