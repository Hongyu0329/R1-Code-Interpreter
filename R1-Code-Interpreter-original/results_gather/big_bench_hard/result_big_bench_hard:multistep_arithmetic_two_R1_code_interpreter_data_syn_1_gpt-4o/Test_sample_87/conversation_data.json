    "To solve the expression \\(((-3 \\times 6 - 0 \\times 6) - (-6 \\times -6 \\times 7 + -8))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part is \\((-3 \\times 6 - 0 \\times 6)\\).\n   - The second part is \\((-6 \\times -6 \\times 7 + -8)\\).\n\n2. **Calculate each part separately**:\n   - For \\((-3 \\times 6 - 0 \\times 6)\\):\n     - \\(-3 \\times 6 = -18\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 6 = 0\\)\n     - So, \\(-18 - 0 = -18\\).\n\n   - For \\((-6 \\times -6 \\times 7 + -8)\\):\n     - \\(-6 \\times -6 = 36\\)\n     - \\(36 \\times 7 = 252\\)\n     - So, \\(252 + (-8) = 252 - 8 = 244\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - Now, substitute back into the main expression: \\((-18) - (244)\\).\n\n4. **Final calculation**:\n   - \\(-18 - 244 = -262\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (-3 * 6 - 0 * 6)\npart2 = (-6 * -6 * 7 + -8)\nresult = part1 - part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
