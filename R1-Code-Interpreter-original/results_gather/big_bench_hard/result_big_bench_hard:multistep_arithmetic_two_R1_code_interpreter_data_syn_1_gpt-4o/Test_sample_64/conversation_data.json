    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve expressions inside parentheses first.\n2. **Exponents**: Evaluate any exponents (not present in this expression).\n3. **Multiplication and Division**: From left to right.\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: From left to right.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. Evaluate the first set of parentheses: \\( (4 + -1 + -7 + 2) \\)\n2. Evaluate the second set of parentheses: \\( (-7 + -9 \\times -6 + -3) \\)\n\nAfter evaluating the parentheses, we will subtract the result of the second set from the first set.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Evaluate the first set of parentheses\nfirst_set = 4 + -1 + -7 + 2\n\n# Evaluate the second set of parentheses\nsecond_set = -7 + (-9 * -6) + -3\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = first_set - second_set\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
