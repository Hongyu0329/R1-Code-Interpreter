    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 + -9 - -2 * 2) - (6 * 1 * -2 * -1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-2 * 2 = -4\\)\n   - \\(6 * 1 * -2 * -1 = 12\\)\n\n2. **Substitute these values back into the expression:**\n   - \\((-2 + -9 - -4) - 12\\)\n\n3. **Simplify inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   - \\(-2 + -9 = -11\\)\n   - \\(-11 - -4 = -11 + 4 = -7\\)\n\n4. **Substitute back into the expression:**\n   - \\(-7 - 12\\)\n\n5. **Perform the final subtraction:**\n   - \\(-7 - 12 = -19\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the expression\nresult = ((-2 + -9 - -2 * 2) - (6 * 1 * -2 * -1))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression \\(((-2 + -9 - -2 * 2) - (6 * 1 * -2 * -1))\\) is \\(-19\\).\n\n<<<-19>>>"
