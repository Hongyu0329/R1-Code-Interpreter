    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate each part of the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((3 - 3 - -3 + -2) + (8 - 2 + -8 - -6))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Evaluate the first part: \\(3 - 3 - -3 + -2\\)\n   - \\(3 - 3 = 0\\)\n   - \\(0 - -3 = 0 + 3 = 3\\)\n   - \\(3 + -2 = 3 - 2 = 1\\)\n\n2. Evaluate the second part: \\(8 - 2 + -8 - -6\\)\n   - \\(8 - 2 = 6\\)\n   - \\(6 + -8 = 6 - 8 = -2\\)\n   - \\(-2 - -6 = -2 + 6 = 4\\)\n\n3. Add the results of the two parts: \\(1 + 4\\)\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = 3 - 3 - (-3) + (-2)\npart2 = 8 - 2 + (-8) - (-6)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression is 5. Therefore, the final answer to the given expression is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
