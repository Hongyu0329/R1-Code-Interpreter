    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 - -6 * 7 * 0) * (0 + -5 * -8 - 0))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(-8 - (-6 * 7 * 0)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-6 * 7 * 0 = 0\\)\n     - So, \\(-8 - 0 = -8\\)\n\n   - The second part: \\(0 + (-5 * -8) - 0\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-5 * -8 = 40\\)\n     - So, \\(0 + 40 - 0 = 40\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the parentheses**:\n   - \\((-8) * (40) = -320\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -8 - (-6 * 7 * 0)\npart2 = 0 + (-5 * -8) - 0\nresult = part1 * part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result of the expression.",
