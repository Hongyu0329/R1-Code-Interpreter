    "To solve the expression \\(((-1 + -7 + -2 - 7) * (6 - 1 - -1 * 5))\\), we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression**: \\((-1 + -7 + -2 - 7)\\)\n   - Combine the numbers: \\(-1 - 7 - 2 - 7\\)\n   - Calculate the sum: \\(-1 - 7 = -8\\), \\(-8 - 2 = -10\\), \\(-10 - 7 = -17\\)\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression**: \\((6 - 1 - -1 * 5)\\)\n   - First, calculate \\(-1 * 5 = -5\\)\n   - Substitute back: \\(6 - 1 - (-5)\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(6 - 1 + 5\\)\n   - Calculate the sum: \\(6 - 1 = 5\\), \\(5 + 5 = 10\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parts**: \\((-17) * (10)\\)\n   - Calculate the product: \\(-17 * 10 = -170\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -1 + -7 + -2 - 7\npart2 = 6 - 1 - (-1 * 5)\nresult = part1 * part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
