    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n   - The first part is: \\(8 \\times 9 \\times 0 - -1\\)\n   - The second part is: \\(-9 - -7 + -4 - 8\\)\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division**: Within the parentheses, perform multiplication first.\n   - \\(8 \\times 9 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**: Now, solve the remaining operations inside the parentheses.\n   - For the first part: \\(0 - -1 = 0 + 1 = 1\\)\n   - For the second part: \\(-9 - -7 + -4 - 8\\)\n     - \\(-9 - -7 = -9 + 7 = -2\\)\n     - \\(-2 + -4 = -6\\)\n     - \\(-6 - 8 = -14\\)\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: Now, substitute the results back into the main expression.\n   - \\((1) - (-14)\\)\n   - \\(1 + 14 = 15\\)\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = 8 * 9 * 0 - -1\npart2 = -9 - -7 + -4 - 8\nresult = part1 - part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
