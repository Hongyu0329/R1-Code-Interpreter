    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - 6 + 7 - 7) - (5 + 3 - 9 \\times -8))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\((-6 - 6 + 7 - 7)\\)\n     - \\(-6 - 6 = -12\\)\n     - \\(-12 + 7 = -5\\)\n     - \\(-5 - 7 = -12\\)\n\n   - The second part: \\((5 + 3 - 9 \\times -8)\\)\n     - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(-9 \\times -8 = 72\\)\n     - Then, evaluate the addition and subtraction: \n       - \\(5 + 3 = 8\\)\n       - \\(8 + 72 = 80\\)\n\n2. **Combine the results from the parentheses**:\n   - \\((-12) - (80)\\)\n\n3. **Perform the final subtraction**:\n   - \\(-12 - 80 = -92\\)\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (-6 - 6 + 7 - 7)\npart2 = (5 + 3 - 9 * -8)\nresult = part1 - part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
