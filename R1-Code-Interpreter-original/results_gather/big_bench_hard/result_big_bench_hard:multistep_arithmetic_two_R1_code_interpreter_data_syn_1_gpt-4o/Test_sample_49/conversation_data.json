    "To solve the given expression, we need to break it down into smaller parts and evaluate each part step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-7 \\times 9 - -9 + 7) + (9 \\times -6 \\times -4 \\times -6))\n\\]\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n\n1. **First Part: \\((-7 \\times 9 - -9 + 7)\\)**\n\n   - Calculate \\(-7 \\times 9\\)\n   - Subtract \\(-9\\) (which is equivalent to adding 9)\n   - Add 7\n\n2. **Second Part: \\((9 \\times -6 \\times -4 \\times -6)\\)**\n\n   - Calculate \\(9 \\times -6\\)\n   - Multiply the result by \\(-4\\)\n   - Multiply the result by \\(-6\\)\n\nFinally, add the results of the first and second parts together.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# First part calculation\nfirst_part = (-7 * 9) - (-9) + 7\n\n# Second part calculation\nsecond_part = 9 * -6 * -4 * -6\n\n# Total result\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
