    "To solve the expression \\((4 + 7 \\times 4 - -5) - (-4 - 1 - -4 - 4)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve expressions inside parentheses first.\n2. **Multiplication**: Perform multiplication operations.\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Inside the first parentheses**: \n   - \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)\n   - \\(4 + 28 - -5\\) becomes \\(4 + 28 + 5\\) because subtracting a negative is the same as adding.\n   - \\(4 + 28 + 5 = 37\\)\n\n2. **Inside the second parentheses**:\n   - \\(-4 - 1 - -4 - 4\\) becomes \\(-4 - 1 + 4 - 4\\) because subtracting a negative is the same as adding.\n   - \\(-4 - 1 + 4 - 4 = -5\\)\n\n3. **Final subtraction**:\n   - \\(37 - (-5)\\) becomes \\(37 + 5\\) because subtracting a negative is the same as adding.\n   - \\(37 + 5 = 42\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = (4 + 7 * 4 - -5) - (-4 - 1 - -4 - 4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of the expression \\((4 + 7 \\times 4 - -5) - (-4 - 1 - -4 - 4)\\) is indeed 42.\n\n<<<42>>>"
