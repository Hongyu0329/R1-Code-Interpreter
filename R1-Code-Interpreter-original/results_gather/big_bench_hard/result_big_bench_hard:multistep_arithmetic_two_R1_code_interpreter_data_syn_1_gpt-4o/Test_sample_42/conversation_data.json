    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 + 1 - 2 - -3) * (-9 * 3 + 9 + -1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n1. **Simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\(-5 + 1 - 2 - -3\\)\n\n   - \\(-5 + 1 = -4\\)\n   - \\(-4 - 2 = -6\\)\n   - \\(-6 - -3 = -6 + 3 = -3\\)\n\n   So, the first part simplifies to \\(-3\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\(-9 * 3 + 9 + -1\\)\n\n   - \\(-9 * 3 = -27\\)\n   - \\(-27 + 9 = -18\\)\n   - \\(-18 + -1 = -19\\)\n\n   So, the second part simplifies to \\(-19\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two simplified expressions:**\n   \\(-3 * -19\\)\n\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive, so \\(-3 * -19 = 57\\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -5 + 1 - 2 - -3\npart2 = -9 * 3 + 9 + -1\nresult = part1 * part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression \\(((-5 + 1 - 2 - -3) * (-9 * 3 + 9 + -1))\\) is indeed 57.\n\n<<<57>>>"
