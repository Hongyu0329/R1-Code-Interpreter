    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 - -4 * 2 - 9) * (9 - 6 - 1 + -4))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\(-7 - -4 * 2 - 9\\)\n     - First, calculate \\(-4 * 2 = -8\\).\n     - Then, substitute back: \\(-7 - (-8) - 9\\).\n     - Simplify: \\(-7 + 8 - 9\\).\n     - Calculate: \\(1 - 9 = -8\\).\n\n   - For the second part: \\(9 - 6 - 1 + -4\\)\n     - Calculate: \\(9 - 6 = 3\\).\n     - Then: \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\n     - Finally: \\(2 + (-4) = -2\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the evaluated parentheses**:\n   - \\((-8) * (-2)\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -7 - (-4 * 2) - 9\nsecond_part = 9 - 6 - 1 + (-4)\nresult = first_part * second_part\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
