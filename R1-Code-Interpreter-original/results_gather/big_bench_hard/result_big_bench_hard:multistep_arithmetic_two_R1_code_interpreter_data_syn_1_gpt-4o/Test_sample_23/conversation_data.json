    "To solve the expression \\((1 - 7 - -8 \\times 3) + (-7 - -2 + -3 \\times 6)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication operations**:\n   - \\(-8 \\times 3\\)\n   - \\(-3 \\times 6\\)\n\n2. **Substitute the results back into the expression** and simplify:\n   - Calculate the results of the multiplications.\n   - Substitute these results back into the expression.\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Evaluate the multiplication operations\nmultiplication1 = -8 * 3\nmultiplication2 = -3 * 6\n\n# Step 2: Substitute and simplify the expression\nresult = (1 - 7 - multiplication1) + (-7 - -2 + multiplication2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
