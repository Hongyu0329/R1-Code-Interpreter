    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - 4 \\times 2 - 6) + (1 + -2 \\times 1 \\times 7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\((-6 - 4 \\times 2 - 6)\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)\n     - Then, substitute back into the expression: \\(-6 - 8 - 6\\)\n     - Perform the subtraction from left to right: \\(-6 - 8 = -14\\), then \\(-14 - 6 = -20\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\((1 + -2 \\times 1 \\times 7)\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-2 \\times 1 = -2\\), then \\(-2 \\times 7 = -14\\)\n     - Then, substitute back into the expression: \\(1 + (-14)\\)\n     - Perform the addition: \\(1 - 14 = -13\\)\n\n2. **Combine the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\((-20) + (-13)\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-20 - 13 = -33\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -6 - 4 * 2 - 6\npart2 = 1 + -2 * 1 * 7\nresult = part1 + part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression \\(((-6 - 4 \\times 2 - 6) + (1 + -2 \\times 1 \\times 7))\\) is \\(-33\\).\n\n<<<-33>>>"
