    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((1 + 7 \\times -9 + -5) + (3 + -5 \\times 2 - 6))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(1 + 7 \\times -9 + -5\\)\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(3 + -5 \\times 2 - 6\\)\n\n2. Within each set of parentheses, perform multiplication first, then addition and subtraction.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = 1 + 7 * -9 + -5\nsecond_part = 3 + -5 * 2 - 6\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression. The expression evaluates to \\(-80\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-80>>>"
