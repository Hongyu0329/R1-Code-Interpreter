    "To solve the expression \\(((3 \\times -3 \\times 6 + -5) - (-2 + -7 - 7 - -7))\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the multiplication and addition in the first part:**\n   - \\(3 \\times -3 \\times 6\\)\n   - Add \\(-5\\) to the result of the multiplication.\n\n2. **Calculate the addition and subtraction in the second part:**\n   - \\(-2 + -7 - 7 - -7\\)\n\n3. **Subtract the result of the second part from the result of the first part.**\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# First part calculation\nfirst_part = (3 * -3 * 6) + -5\n\n# Second part calculation\nsecond_part = -2 + -7 - 7 - -7\n\n# Final result\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
