    "To solve the given expression \\((1 - 6 \\times 0 - -7) \\times (6 \\times 0 + 6 - -3)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(1 - 6 \\times 0 - -7\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n     - So, the expression becomes \\(1 - 0 - -7\\)\n     - Simplifying further: \\(1 + 7 = 8\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(6 \\times 0 + 6 - -3\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n     - So, the expression becomes \\(0 + 6 - -3\\)\n     - Simplifying further: \\(6 + 3 = 9\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = 1 - 6 * 0 - -7\npart2 = 6 * 0 + 6 - -3\nresult = part1 * part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The result of the expression \\((1 - 6 \\times 0 - -7) \\times (6 \\times 0 + 6 - -3)\\) is indeed 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"
