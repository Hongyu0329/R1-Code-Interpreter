    "To solve the given expression, we need to carefully evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. **Parentheses/Brackets**: Solve expressions inside parentheses first.\n2. **Exponents/Orders**: Evaluate powers and roots.\n3. **Multiplication and Division**: From left to right.\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: From left to right.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-1 - -9 \\times 8 - -9) + (-9 - 2 \\times -6 + -6))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(-9 \\times 8 = -72\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times -6 = -12\\)\n\n2. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - \\((-1 - (-72) - -9) + (-9 - (-12) + -6)\\)\n\n3. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(-1 + 72 + 9\\) for the first set of parentheses.\n   - \\(-9 + 12 - 6\\) for the second set of parentheses.\n\n4. **Calculate the results of the simplified expressions**:\n   - First set: \\(-1 + 72 + 9 = 80\\)\n   - Second set: \\(-9 + 12 - 6 = -3\\)\n\n5. **Add the results of the two sets**:\n   - \\(80 + (-3) = 77\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the expression\nresult = ((-1 - (-9 * 8) - (-9)) + (-9 - (2 * -6) + (-6)))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final result.",
