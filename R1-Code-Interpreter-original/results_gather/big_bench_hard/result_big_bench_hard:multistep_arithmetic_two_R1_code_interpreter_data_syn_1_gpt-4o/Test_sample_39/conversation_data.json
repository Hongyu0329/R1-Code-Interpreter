    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. Exponents (not present here)\n3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-3 \\times 0 \\times 4 - -7) + (-9 \\times -6 - -8 + 1))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Evaluate the multiplication inside the first set of parentheses:\n   - \\(-3 \\times 0 \\times 4 = 0\\)\n   - So, the expression becomes \\((0 - -7)\\).\n\n2. Simplify the subtraction:\n   - \\(0 - -7 = 0 + 7 = 7\\)\n\n3. Evaluate the multiplication inside the second set of parentheses:\n   - \\(-9 \\times -6 = 54\\)\n   - So, the expression becomes \\((54 - -8 + 1)\\).\n\n4. Simplify the subtraction and addition:\n   - \\(54 - -8 = 54 + 8 = 62\\)\n   - \\(62 + 1 = 63\\)\n\n5. Combine the results from both sets of parentheses:\n   - \\(7 + 63 = 70\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = ((-3 * 0 * 4 - -7) + (-9 * -6 - -8 + 1))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression is indeed 70. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<70>>>"
