    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((7 + 1 + 9 \\times 1) + (7 - -3 + 3 \\times 1))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(7 + 1 + 9 \\times 1\\)\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(7 - -3 + 3 \\times 1\\)\n\n2. Within each set of parentheses, perform multiplication first, then addition and subtraction.\n\nLet's calculate these step by step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# First set of parentheses\nfirst_part = 7 + 1 + 9 * 1\n\n# Second set of parentheses\nsecond_part = 7 - -3 + 3 * 1\n\n# Total expression\ntotal = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is 30. \n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1. **First set of parentheses**: \n   - \\(7 + 1 + 9 \\times 1 = 7 + 1 + 9 = 17\\)\n\n2. **Second set of parentheses**: \n   - \\(7 - -3 + 3 \\times 1 = 7 + 3 + 3 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Total expression**: \n   - \\(17 + 13 = 30\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<30>>>"
