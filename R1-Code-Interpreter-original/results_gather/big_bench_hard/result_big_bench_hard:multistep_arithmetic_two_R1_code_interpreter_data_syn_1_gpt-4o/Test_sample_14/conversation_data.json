    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 - 4 \\times -8 + 8) \\times (4 + 3 - 9 \\times 7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(-5 - 4 \\times -8 + 8\\)\n     - First, handle the multiplication: \\(4 \\times -8 = -32\\)\n     - Then, substitute back: \\(-5 - (-32) + 8\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(-5 + 32 + 8\\)\n     - Result: \\(35\\)\n\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(4 + 3 - 9 \\times 7\\)\n     - First, handle the multiplication: \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\)\n     - Then, substitute back: \\(4 + 3 - 63\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(7 - 63\\)\n     - Result: \\(-56\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\(35 \\times -56\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_parentheses = -5 - 4 * -8 + 8\nsecond_parentheses = 4 + 3 - 9 * 7\nresult = first_parentheses * second_parentheses\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
