    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 + -3 + 6 - 8) - (-7 * -2 * -6 + -6))\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expressions first:**\n   - Calculate the sum and difference inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-9 + -3 + 6 - 8)\\).\n   - Calculate the product and sum inside the second set of parentheses: \\((-7 * -2 * -6 + -6)\\).\n\n2. **Combine the results:**\n   - Subtract the result of the second expression from the result of the first expression.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the first part: (-9 + -3 + 6 - 8)\npart1 = (-9 + -3 + 6 - 8)\n\n# Calculate the second part: (-7 * -2 * -6 + -6)\npart2 = (-7 * -2 * -6 + -6)\n\n# Calculate the final result: (part1 - part2)\nresult = (part1 - part2)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
