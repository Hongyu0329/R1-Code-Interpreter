    "To solve the expression \\(((-1 - 9 + -9 * -9) - (1 + -3 - 5 - 5))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part is \\((-1 - 9 + -9 * -9)\\).\n   - The second part is \\((1 + -3 - 5 - 5)\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the first parentheses**:\n   - \\(-9 * -9 = 81\\).\n\n3. **Substitute back into the first parentheses**:\n   - \\((-1 - 9 + 81)\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the first parentheses**:\n   - \\(-1 - 9 = -10\\).\n   - \\(-10 + 81 = 71\\).\n\n5. **Evaluate the second parentheses**:\n   - \\(1 + -3 = -2\\).\n   - \\(-2 - 5 = -7\\).\n   - \\(-7 - 5 = -12\\).\n\n6. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\(71 - (-12)\\).\n\n7. **Simplify the subtraction**:\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive.\n   - \\(71 + 12 = 83\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = ((-1 - 9 + -9 * -9) - (1 + -3 - 5 - 5))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
