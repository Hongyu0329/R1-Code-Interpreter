    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - 8 - -7 * -2) - (-9 - 5 + 7 + 1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-7 * -2 = 14\\)\n\n2. **Substitute back into the expression:**\n   - \\((-6 - 8 - 14) - (-9 - 5 + 7 + 1)\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate the expressions inside each set of parentheses:**\n   - First set: \\(-6 - 8 - 14 = -28\\)\n   - Second set: \\(-9 - 5 + 7 + 1 = -6\\)\n\n4. **Substitute back into the expression:**\n   - \\((-28) - (-6)\\)\n\n5. **Evaluate the final expression:**\n   - \\(-28 + 6 = -22\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = ((-6 - 8 - (-7 * -2)) - (-9 - 5 + 7 + 1))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
