    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\(1 + 1 \\times 3 - 2\\)\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\(-8 - -2 - 9 + -9\\)\n\n2. **Inside the first parentheses**: \n   - According to PEMDAS, we first perform multiplication: \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n   - Then, perform addition and subtraction from left to right: \n     - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n     - \\(4 - 2 = 2\\)\n\n3. **Inside the second parentheses**:\n   - Simplify the expression: \n     - \\(-8 - (-2) = -8 + 2 = -6\\)\n     - \\(-6 - 9 = -15\\)\n     - \\(-15 + (-9) = -15 - 9 = -24\\)\n\n4. **Combine the results**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two parentheses: \\(2 \\times (-24)\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_parentheses = 1 + 1 * 3 - 2\nsecond_parentheses = -8 - -2 - 9 + -9\nresult = first_parentheses * second_parentheses\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
