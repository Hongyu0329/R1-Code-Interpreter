    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 - -9 + 0 + -3) + (-2 - -1 - 1 + 2))\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and evaluate each part step by step.\n\n1. Evaluate the first part: \\((-9 - -9 + 0 + -3)\\)\n   - \\(-9 - -9\\) simplifies to \\(0\\) because subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive.\n   - So, the expression becomes \\(0 + 0 + -3\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(-3\\).\n\n2. Evaluate the second part: \\((-2 - -1 - 1 + 2)\\)\n   - \\(-2 - -1\\) simplifies to \\(-2 + 1\\), which is \\(-1\\).\n   - \\(-1 - 1\\) is \\(-2\\).\n   - \\(-2 + 2\\) is \\(0\\).\n\n3. Combine the results of the two parts:\n   - The first part evaluated to \\(-3\\).\n   - The second part evaluated to \\(0\\).\n   - Adding these results: \\(-3 + 0 = -3\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (-9 - -9 + 0 + -3)\npart2 = (-2 - -1 - 1 + 2)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final answer.",
