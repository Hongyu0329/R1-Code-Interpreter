    "To solve the given expression, we need to break it down into its components and evaluate it step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-4 + -5 \\times 7 + 7) + (3 \\times -3 - -4 + 4))\n\\]\n\nLet's evaluate each part separately:\n\n1. **First Part: \\((-4 + -5 \\times 7 + 7)\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(-5 \\times 7\\)\n   - Add \\(-4\\) to the result\n   - Add \\(7\\) to the result\n\n2. **Second Part: \\((3 \\times -3 - -4 + 4)\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times -3\\)\n   - Subtract \\(-4\\) (which is equivalent to adding 4)\n   - Add \\(4\\) to the result\n\nFinally, add the results of the first and second parts together.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# First part of the expression\nfirst_part = -4 + (-5 * 7) + 7\n\n# Second part of the expression\nsecond_part = (3 * -3) - (-4) + 4\n\n# Total result\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
