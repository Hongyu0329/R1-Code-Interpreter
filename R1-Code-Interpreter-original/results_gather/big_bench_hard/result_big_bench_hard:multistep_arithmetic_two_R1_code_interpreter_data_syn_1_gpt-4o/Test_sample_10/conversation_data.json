    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\(6 - 0 \\times 5 + (-3)\\)\n     - Multiplication first: \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n     - Then, \\(6 - 0 + (-3) = 6 - 3 = 3\\)\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\(6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7)\\)\n     - Simplify the negative signs: \\(6 + 7 - 2 + 7\\)\n     - Then, \\(6 + 7 = 13\\), \\(13 - 2 = 11\\), \\(11 + 7 = 18\\)\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Multiply the results of the two parentheses.\n   - \\(3 \\times 18\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_parentheses = 6 - 0 * 5 + (-3)\nsecond_parentheses = 6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7)\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = first_parentheses * second_parentheses\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
