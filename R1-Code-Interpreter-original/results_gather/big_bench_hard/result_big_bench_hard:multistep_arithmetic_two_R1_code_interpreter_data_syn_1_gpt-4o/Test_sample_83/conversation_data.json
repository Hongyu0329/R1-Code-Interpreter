    "To solve the expression \\((9 - -6 \\times 9 \\times 4) - (6 - 4 \\times -8 \\times -7)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\(9 - (-6 \\times 9 \\times 4)\\)\n   - For the second part: \\(6 - (4 \\times -8 \\times -7)\\)\n\n2. **Perform the multiplications inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(-6 \\times 9 \\times 4\\)\n   - \\(4 \\times -8 \\times -7\\)\n\n3. **Subtract the results from the initial numbers inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(9 - \\text{result of the first multiplication}\\)\n   - \\(6 - \\text{result of the second multiplication}\\)\n\n4. **Subtract the second result from the first result**.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = 9 - (-6 * 9 * 4)\nsecond_part = 6 - (4 * -8 * -7)\n\n# Final result\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
