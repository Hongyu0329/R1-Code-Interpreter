    "To solve the expression \\((2 - -2 + -7 * 8) * (-7 * -8 * 3 - -2)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(2 - -2 + -7 * 8\\)\n     - \\(2 - -2\\) becomes \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\n     - \\(-7 * 8 = -56\\)\n     - So, \\(4 + (-56) = 4 - 56 = -52\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(-7 * -8 * 3 - -2\\)\n     - \\(-7 * -8 = 56\\)\n     - \\(56 * 3 = 168\\)\n     - \\(- -2\\) becomes \\(+2\\)\n     - So, \\(168 + 2 = 170\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the simplified expressions:**\n\n   - \\((-52) * (170)\\)\n\nNow, let's compute the final multiplication using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (-52) * (170)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final answer.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully. The result of the expression \\((2 - -2 + -7 * 8) * (-7 * -8 * 3 - -2)\\) is \\(-8840\\).\n\n<<<-8840>>>"
