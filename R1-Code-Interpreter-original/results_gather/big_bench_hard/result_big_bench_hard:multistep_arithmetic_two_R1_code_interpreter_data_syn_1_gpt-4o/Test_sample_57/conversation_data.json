    "To solve the expression \\((5 + 6 \\times 4 \\times 9) + (-9 - 0 \\times 3 - 1)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.\n2. **Multiplication**: Perform multiplication operations.\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses: \\(6 \\times 4 \\times 9\\).\n2. Add the result to 5.\n3. Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\(-9 - 0 \\times 3 - 1\\).\n4. Add the results of the two main parts.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = 5 + (6 * 4 * 9)\npart2 = (-9 - 0 * 3 - 1)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((5 + 6 \\times 4 \\times 9) + (-9 - 0 \\times 3 - 1)\\) is 211. \n\nThe steps were as follows:\n- Calculate \\(6 \\times 4 \\times 9 = 216\\).\n- Add 5 to 216, resulting in 221.\n- Evaluate \\(-9 - 0 \\times 3 - 1 = -9 - 0 - 1 = -10\\).\n- Add 221 and -10 to get 211.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<211>>>"
