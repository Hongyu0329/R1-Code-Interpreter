    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n((-6 + -9 - -6 + -4) * (-1 - -6 + -4 - 3))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\((-6 + -9 - -6 + -4)\\)\n     - \\(-6 + -9 = -15\\)\n     - \\(-15 - -6 = -15 + 6 = -9\\)\n     - \\(-9 + -4 = -13\\)\n\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\((-1 - -6 + -4 - 3)\\)\n     - \\(-1 - -6 = -1 + 6 = 5\\)\n     - \\(5 + -4 = 1\\)\n     - \\(1 - 3 = -2\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the parentheses:**\n\n   - \\((-13) * (-2) = 26\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_parentheses = (-6 + -9 - -6 + -4)\nsecond_parentheses = (-1 - -6 + -4 - 3)\nresult = first_parentheses * second_parentheses\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression is indeed 26. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<26>>>"
