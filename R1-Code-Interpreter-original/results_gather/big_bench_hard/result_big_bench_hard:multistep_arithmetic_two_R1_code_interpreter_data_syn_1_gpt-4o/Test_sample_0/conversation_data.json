    "To solve the expression \\(((-1 + 2 + 9 \\times 5) - (-2 + -4 + -4 \\times -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\((-1 + 2 + 9 \\times 5)\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(9 \\times 5 = 45\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition/subtraction: \\(-1 + 2 + 45\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\((-2 + -4 + -4 \\times -7)\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-4 \\times -7 = 28\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition/subtraction: \\(-2 + -4 + 28\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parts.**\n\nLet's calculate these using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the first part\nfirst_part = -1 + 2 + 9 * 5\n\n# Calculate the second part\nsecond_part = -2 + -4 + (-4 * -7)\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
