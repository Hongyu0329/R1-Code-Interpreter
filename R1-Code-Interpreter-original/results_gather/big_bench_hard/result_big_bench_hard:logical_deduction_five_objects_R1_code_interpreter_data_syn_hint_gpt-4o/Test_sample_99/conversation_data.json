    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The cardinal is the rightmost.\n2. The raven is to the left of the owl.\n3. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n4. The hummingbird is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the hummingbird is the third from the left, the positions are as follows: \n  1. [unknown]\n  2. [unknown]\n  3. Hummingbird\n  4. [unknown]\n  5. [unknown]\n\n- The cardinal is the rightmost, so it must be in the 5th position:\n  1. [unknown]\n  2. [unknown]\n  3. Hummingbird\n  4. [unknown]\n  5. Cardinal\n\n- The robin is to the right of the hummingbird, so the robin must be in the 4th position:\n  1. [unknown]\n  2. [unknown]\n  3. Hummingbird\n  4. Robin\n  5. Cardinal\n\n- The raven is to the left of the owl. The only positions left for the raven and the owl are the 1st and 2nd positions. Therefore, the raven must be in the 1st position and the owl in the 2nd position:\n  1. Raven\n  2. Owl\n  3. Hummingbird\n  4. Robin\n  5. Cardinal\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The raven is the leftmost - This is correct based on our arrangement.\n(B) The owl is the leftmost - Incorrect, the owl is in the second position.\n(C) The cardinal is the leftmost - Incorrect, the cardinal is the rightmost.\n(D) The hummingbird is the leftmost - Incorrect, the hummingbird is third from the left.\n(E) The robin is the leftmost - Incorrect, the robin is in the fourth position.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
