    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Rob finished below Dan.\n2. Joe finished below Ana.\n3. Joe finished above Amy.\n4. Dan finished below Amy.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- From condition 1, we know: Dan > Rob\n- From condition 2, we know: Ana > Joe\n- From condition 3, we know: Joe > Amy\n- From condition 4, we know: Amy > Dan\n\nNow, let's try to arrange them in order:\n\n1. Ana > Joe (from condition 2)\n2. Joe > Amy (from condition 3)\n3. Amy > Dan (from condition 4)\n4. Dan > Rob (from condition 1)\n\nThis gives us the order: Ana > Joe > Amy > Dan > Rob\n\nFrom this order, we can see that Rob finished last.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Rob finished last"
