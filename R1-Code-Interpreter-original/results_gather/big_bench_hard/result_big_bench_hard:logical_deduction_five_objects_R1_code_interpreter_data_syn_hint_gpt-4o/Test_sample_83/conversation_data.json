    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Joe finished second.\n2. Joe finished below Amy.\n3. Mel finished second-to-last.\n4. Ada finished last.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since Joe finished second, this directly matches option (D).\n- Joe finished below Amy, which means Amy must have finished first.\n- Mel finished second-to-last, which means Mel finished fourth.\n- Ada finished last, which means Ada finished fifth.\n\nBased on these deductions, the order of finish is:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Rob (since Rob is the only one left)\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) Joe finished second.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
