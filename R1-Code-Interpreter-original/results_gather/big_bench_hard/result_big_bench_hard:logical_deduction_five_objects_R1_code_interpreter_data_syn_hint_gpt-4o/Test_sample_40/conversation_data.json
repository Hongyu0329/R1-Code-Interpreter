    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The tractor is newer than the hatchback.\n2. The limousine is the second-newest.\n3. The truck is older than the hatchback.\n4. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it cannot be the oldest. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.\n- The limousine is the second-newest, so it cannot be the oldest. Therefore, option (E) is incorrect.\n- The tractor is newer than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the newest. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n- The truck is older than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the oldest. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible order:\n\n- The convertible is the second-oldest, so it must be in the second position from the left.\n- The limousine is the second-newest, so it must be in the second position from the right.\n- The truck is older than the hatchback, so the truck must be in the first position (oldest) because the convertible is already in the second position.\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Truck\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Limousine\n5. Tractor\n\nTherefore, the truck is the oldest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
