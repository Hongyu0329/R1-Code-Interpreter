    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. \"The owl is the second from the right.\" - This means the owl is in the fourth position from the left.\n\n2. \"The robin is the second from the left.\" - This means the robin is in the second position from the left.\n\n3. \"The robin is to the right of the blue jay.\" - This means the blue jay must be in the first position because the robin is already in the second position.\n\n4. \"The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\" - This means the hawk must be in the third position, and the hummingbird must be in the fifth position.\n\nNow, let's arrange the birds based on these clues:\n\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Owl\n5. Hummingbird\n\nWith this arrangement, we can see that the owl is indeed the second from the right, which matches option (A).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
