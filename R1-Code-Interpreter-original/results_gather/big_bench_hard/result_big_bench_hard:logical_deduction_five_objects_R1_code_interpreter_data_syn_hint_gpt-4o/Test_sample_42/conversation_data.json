    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the owl.\n2. The hummingbird is to the right of the cardinal.\n3. The crow is to the left of the robin.\n4. The owl is to the left of the crow.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- From condition 1, we know: Hummingbird (H) is to the left of Owl (O).\n- From condition 2, we know: Cardinal (C) is to the left of Hummingbird (H).\n- From condition 3, we know: Crow (Cr) is to the left of Robin (R).\n- From condition 4, we know: Owl (O) is to the left of Crow (Cr).\n\nNow, let's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Since C is to the left of H, and H is to the left of O, the order must be: C, H, O.\n2. Since O is to the left of Cr, and Cr is to the left of R, the order must be: O, Cr, R.\n\nCombining these, we get the order: C, H, O, Cr, R.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The owl is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the owl is not the rightmost.\n(B) The cardinal is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the cardinal is not the rightmost.\n(C) The robin is the rightmost - Correct, as the robin is the rightmost.\n(D) The hummingbird is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the hummingbird is not the rightmost.\n(E) The crow is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the crow is not the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
