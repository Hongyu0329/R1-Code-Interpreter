    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n2. The green book is the second from the right.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the white book.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 2, the green book is the second from the right, so it must be in the fourth position.\n- From condition 1, the gray book is to the right of the orange book, so the gray book cannot be in the first, second, or third positions.\n- From condition 3, the brown book is to the right of the white book, so the white book cannot be in the fourth or fifth positions.\n- From condition 4, the brown book is to the left of the orange book, so the brown book cannot be in the fourth or fifth positions.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n1. The green book is in the fourth position.\n2. The gray book must be in the fifth position (since it is to the right of the orange book).\n3. The orange book must be in the third position (since it is to the left of the gray book).\n4. The brown book must be in the second position (since it is to the left of the orange book).\n5. The white book must be in the first position (since it is to the left of the brown book).\n\nThe order of the books is: White, Brown, Orange, Green, Gray.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The white book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it is first.\n(B) The green book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it is fourth.\n(C) The brown book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it is second.\n(D) The gray book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it is fifth.\n(E) The orange book is the third from the left - Correct, it is third.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
