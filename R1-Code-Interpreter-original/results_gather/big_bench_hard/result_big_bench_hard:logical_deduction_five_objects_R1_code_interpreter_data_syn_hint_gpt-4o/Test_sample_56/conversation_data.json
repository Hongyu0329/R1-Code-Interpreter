    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Mya finished first.\n2. Dan finished last.\n3. Amy finished above Mel.\n4. Amy finished below Eli.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since Mya finished first, the order starts with Mya.\n- Dan finished last, so the order ends with Dan.\n- Amy finished above Mel, meaning Amy's position is better than Mel's.\n- Amy finished below Eli, meaning Eli's position is better than Amy's.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n1. Mya\n2. Eli\n3. Amy\n4. Mel\n5. Dan\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions:\n- Mya is first.\n- Dan is last.\n- Amy is above Mel.\n- Amy is below Eli.\n\nNow, we need to determine who finished third. In the order we derived, Amy is in the third position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
