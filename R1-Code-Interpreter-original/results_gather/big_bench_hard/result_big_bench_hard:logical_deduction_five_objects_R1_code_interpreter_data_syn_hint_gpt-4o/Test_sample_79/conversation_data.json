    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. The quail is the leftmost bird.\n2. The robin is the second from the left.\n3. The hawk is the third from the left.\n4. The blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the birds in order:\n\n- The quail is the first bird.\n- The robin is the second bird.\n- The hawk is the third bird.\n\nNow, we have the first three positions filled: Quail, Robin, Hawk.\n\nNext, we need to place the blue jay and the hummingbird. The blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird. Since the first three positions are already filled, the only positions left are the fourth and fifth. Therefore, the blue jay must be fourth, and the hummingbird must be fifth.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Quail\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) The quail is the third from the left - Incorrect, the quail is first.\n(B) The hummingbird is the third from the left - Incorrect, the hummingbird is fifth.\n(C) The blue jay is the third from the left - Incorrect, the blue jay is fourth.\n(D) The hawk is the third from the left - Correct, the hawk is indeed third.\n(E) The robin is the third from the left - Incorrect, the robin is second.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
