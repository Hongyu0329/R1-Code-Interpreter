    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is the rightmost.\n2. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n4. The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the green book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be in the 1st position.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. The green book is in the 5th position.\n2. The gray book must be to the right of the orange book and to the left of the purple book. Therefore, the gray book can be in the 3rd position, the orange book in the 2nd position, and the purple book in the 4th position.\n3. The yellow book must be to the right of the purple book, so it can be in the 4th position.\n\nLet's verify this order:\n- Orange book (2nd position), Gray book (3rd position), Purple book (4th position), Yellow book (4th position), Green book (5th position).\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions:\n- The green book is the rightmost.\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: Orange, Gray, Purple, Yellow, Green.\n\nThe second from the right is the Yellow book.\n\nThus, the correct option is (D) The yellow book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
