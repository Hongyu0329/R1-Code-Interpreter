    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Mel finished first.\n2. Amy finished below Dan.\n3. Joe finished above Dan.\n4. Eve finished last.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know Mel is in the 1st position.\n- From statement 4, we know Eve is in the 5th position.\n- Since Joe finished above Dan and Amy finished below Dan, Dan cannot be in the 2nd position. Therefore, Joe must be in the 2nd position.\n- Since Amy finished below Dan, Dan must be in the 3rd position, and Amy must be in the 4th position.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Mel\n2. Joe\n3. Dan\n4. Amy\n5. Eve\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) Mel finished first - This is correct based on our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
