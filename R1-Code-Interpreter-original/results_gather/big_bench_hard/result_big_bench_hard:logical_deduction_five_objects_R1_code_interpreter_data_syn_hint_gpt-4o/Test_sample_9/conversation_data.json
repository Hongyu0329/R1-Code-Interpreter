    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The tractor is newer than the minivan.\n2. The tractor is older than the limousine.\n3. The convertible is older than the sedan.\n4. The convertible is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 4, we know the convertible is the second-newest. This means there is only one vehicle newer than the convertible.\n- From statement 1, the tractor is newer than the minivan, so the minivan cannot be the newest.\n- From statement 2, the tractor is older than the limousine, so the limousine is newer than the tractor.\n- From statement 3, the convertible is older than the sedan, so the sedan is newer than the convertible.\n\nGiven that the convertible is the second-newest, the only vehicle that can be newer than the convertible is the sedan. Therefore, the order from newest to oldest is:\n\n1. Sedan (newest)\n2. Convertible (second-newest)\n3. Limousine\n4. Tractor\n5. Minivan (oldest)\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the second-oldest. From the order above, the second-oldest vehicle is the tractor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) The tractor is the second-oldest"
