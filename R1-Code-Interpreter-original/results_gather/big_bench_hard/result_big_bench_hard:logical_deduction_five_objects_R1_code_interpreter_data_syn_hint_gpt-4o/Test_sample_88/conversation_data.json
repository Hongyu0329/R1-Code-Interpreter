    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Oranges are more expensive than mangoes.\n3. Apples are the third-most expensive.\n4. Pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since apples are the third-most expensive, there are two fruits more expensive than apples.\n- From statement 1, apples are more expensive than oranges, so oranges cannot be in the top two positions.\n- From statement 2, oranges are more expensive than mangoes, so mangoes cannot be in the top three positions.\n- From statement 4, pears are more expensive than watermelons, so watermelons cannot be in the top two positions.\n\nGiven that apples are the third-most expensive, we can deduce the following order from most expensive to least expensive:\n\n1. Pears (since they are more expensive than watermelons and must be in the top two)\n2. Oranges (since they are more expensive than mangoes and cannot be in the top position)\n3. Apples (as given)\n4. Watermelons (since they are less expensive than pears)\n5. Mangoes (since they are less expensive than oranges)\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The apples are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, apples are third.\n(B) The oranges are the second-most expensive - Correct, as per our order.\n(C) The watermelons are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, watermelons are fourth.\n(D) The pears are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, pears are first.\n(E) The mangoes are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, mangoes are fifth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
