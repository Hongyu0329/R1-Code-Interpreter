    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Eli.\n2. Amy finished below Mel.\n3. Ada finished second.\n4. Mel finished below Eli.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Ada finished second, we can place her in the second position.\n- Ada finished above Eli, so Eli cannot be in the first position. Therefore, Eli must be in the third, fourth, or fifth position.\n- Mel finished below Eli, so Mel cannot be in the third position if Eli is in the fourth or fifth position. Therefore, Mel must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- Amy finished below Mel, so Amy must be in the fifth position if Mel is in the fourth position.\n\nNow, let's try to place the golfers:\n\n1. Ada is in the second position.\n2. Eli cannot be first, so Eli must be third.\n3. Mel must be below Eli, so Mel is fourth.\n4. Amy is below Mel, so Amy is fifth.\n5. Joe is the only one left, so Joe must be first.\n\nThe order is: Joe, Ada, Eli, Mel, Amy.\n\nTherefore, Eli finished third.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Eli finished third.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
