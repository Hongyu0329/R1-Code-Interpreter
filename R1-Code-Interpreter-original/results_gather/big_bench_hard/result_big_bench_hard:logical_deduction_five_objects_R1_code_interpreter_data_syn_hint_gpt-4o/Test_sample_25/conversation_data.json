A fruit stand sells five fruits: watermelons, loquats, pears, plums, and apples. The pears are the second-cheapest. The loquats are more expensive than the pears. The plums are the second-most expensive. The watermelons are the most expensive.\nOptions:\n(A) The watermelons are the third-most expensive\n(B) The loquats are the third-most expensive\n(C) The pears are the third-most expensive\n(D) The plums are the third-most expensive\n(E) The apples are the third-most expensive\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints in the paragraph.\n\n1. **Watermelons** are the most expensive.\n2. **Plums** are the second-most expensive.\n3. **Pears** are the second-cheapest.\n4. **Loquats** are more expensive than pears.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can deduce the following order from most expensive to least expensive:\n\n- 1st: Watermelons (most expensive)\n- 2nd: Plums\n- 3rd: Loquats (since they are more expensive than pears and not the most or second-most expensive)\n- 4th: Pears (second-cheapest)\n- 5th: Apples (cheapest, by elimination)\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the third-most expensive. Based on the order above, the third-most expensive fruit is the **Loquats**.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The loquats are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
