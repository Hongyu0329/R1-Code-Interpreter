    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Eve finished last.\n2. Rob finished above Mel.\n3. Amy finished above Rob.\n4. Mya finished third.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since Mya finished third, we can immediately eliminate options (A), (B), (C), and (E) because they all suggest someone other than Mya finished third.\n- Therefore, the only option that matches the given information is (D) Mya finished third.\n\nNow, let's determine the complete order:\n\n- Eve is last (5th place).\n- Mya is third.\n- Rob finished above Mel, so Rob is either 1st or 2nd, and Mel is either 2nd or 4th.\n- Amy finished above Rob, so Amy must be 1st, and Rob must be 2nd.\n- This leaves Mel in 4th place.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Rob\n3. Mya\n4. Mel\n5. Eve\n\nThus, the correct answer is option (D) Mya finished third.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
