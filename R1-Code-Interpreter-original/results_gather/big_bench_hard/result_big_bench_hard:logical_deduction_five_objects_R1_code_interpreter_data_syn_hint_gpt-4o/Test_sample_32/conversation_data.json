    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Rob finished above Mel.\n2. Mel finished second.\n3. Ana finished above Eli.\n4. Dan finished last.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since Mel finished second, the only possible position for Rob, who finished above Mel, is first.\n- Dan finished last, which is the fifth position.\n- Ana finished above Eli, so Ana cannot be fourth if Eli is third. Therefore, Ana must be third, and Eli must be fourth.\n\nNow, let's list the positions:\n\n1. Rob\n2. Mel\n3. Ana\n4. Eli\n5. Dan\n\nFrom this order, we can see that Eli finished second-to-last, which is the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> D"
