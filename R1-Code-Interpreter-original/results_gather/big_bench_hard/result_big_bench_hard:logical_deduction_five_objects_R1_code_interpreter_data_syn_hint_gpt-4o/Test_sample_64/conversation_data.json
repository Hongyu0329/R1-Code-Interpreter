    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and then identify which book is the rightmost.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The red book is to the right of the gray book.\n2. The black book is to the left of the blue book.\n3. The blue book is to the left of the gray book.\n4. The purple book is the second from the right.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know the purple book is the second from the right, so the order from the rightmost to the leftmost is:\n\n- Rightmost: ?\n- Second from the right: Purple\n- Third from the right: ?\n- Fourth from the right: ?\n- Leftmost: ?\n\nNow, let's use the other conditions to fill in the gaps:\n\n- Condition 3 tells us the blue book is to the left of the gray book. This means the gray book cannot be the rightmost.\n- Condition 1 tells us the red book is to the right of the gray book. This means the red book cannot be the rightmost if the gray book is not the rightmost.\n- Condition 2 tells us the black book is to the left of the blue book. This means the black book cannot be the rightmost.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only book that can be the rightmost is the red book, as it is the only one that can be to the right of all the others based on the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is:\n- Black\n- Blue\n- Gray\n- Purple\n- Red\n\nThus, the rightmost book is the red book.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) The red book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
