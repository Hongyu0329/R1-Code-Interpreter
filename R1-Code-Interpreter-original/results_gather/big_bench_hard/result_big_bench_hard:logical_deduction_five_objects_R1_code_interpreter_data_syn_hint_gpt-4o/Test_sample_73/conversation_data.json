The limousine is the newest.\n3. The bus is the second-newest.\n4. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the limousine is the newest, it must be in the last position.\n- The bus is the second-newest, so it must be just before the limousine.\n- The convertible is the second-oldest, so it must be in the second position.\n- The sedan is newer than the station wagon, which means the station wagon must be the oldest.\n\nArranging these vehicles from oldest to newest based on the above deductions, we get:\n\n1. Station wagon (oldest)\n2. Convertible (second-oldest)\n3. Sedan\n4. Bus (second-newest)\n5.
