    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the brown book.\n2. The gray book is to the left of the blue book.\n3. The green book is to the right of the blue book.\n4. The red book is the leftmost.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the red book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The green book is to the right of the blue book, so the blue book must be to the left of the green book.\n- The gray book is to the left of the blue book, so the gray book must be to the left of both the blue and green books.\n- The green book is to the left of the brown book, so the brown book must be to the right of the green book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the order of the books from left to right is:\n\n1. Red book\n2. Gray book\n3. Blue book\n4. Green book\n5. Brown book\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) The green book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's fourth.\n(B) The blue book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's third.\n(C) The brown book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's fifth.\n(D) The gray book is the second from the left - Correct, it is indeed second.\n(E) The red book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's first.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
