    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The yellow book is the rightmost.\n2. The black book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The orange book is to the left of the purple book.\n4. The black book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The black book is the second from the left, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n- The black book is to the left of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position. It must be in the 3rd or 4th position.\n- The orange book is to the left of the purple book, so the purple book cannot be in the 3rd position if the orange book is in the 3rd position. Therefore, the orange book must be in the 3rd position, and the purple book must be in the 4th position.\n\nNow, let's place the books in order:\n\n1. Red book (since it's the only one left for the 1st position)\n2. Black book\n3. Orange book\n4. Purple book\n5. Yellow book\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The black book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it's second from the left.\n(B) The purple book is the second from the right - Correct, as it is in the 4th position.\n(C) The yellow book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it's the rightmost.\n(D) The orange book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it's in the 3rd position.\n(E) The red book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it's in the 1st position.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The purple book is the second from the right"
