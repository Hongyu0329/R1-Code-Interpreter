    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Oranges are more expensive than mangoes.\n3. Apples are the third-most expensive.\n4. Pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 3, we know that apples are the third-most expensive. This means there are two fruits more expensive than apples and two fruits less expensive than apples.\n- From statement 1, apples are more expensive than oranges, so oranges cannot be one of the two fruits more expensive than apples.\n- From statement 2, oranges are more expensive than mangoes, so mangoes are less expensive than oranges.\n- From statement 4, pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nGiven that apples are the third-most expensive, we can deduce the following order from most expensive to least expensive:\n\n1. Pears (since they are more expensive than watermelons and must be one of the two fruits more expensive than apples)\n2. Oranges (since they are more expensive than mangoes and less expensive than apples)\n3. Apples\n4. Watermelons (since they are less expensive than pears)\n5. Mangoes (since they are less expensive than oranges)\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The apples are the most expensive - Incorrect, apples are third.\n- (B) The oranges are the most expensive - Incorrect, oranges are second.\n- (C) The watermelons are the most expensive - Incorrect, watermelons are fourth.\n- (D) The pears are the most expensive - Correct, pears are first.\n- (E) The mangoes are the most expensive - Incorrect, mangoes are fifth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
