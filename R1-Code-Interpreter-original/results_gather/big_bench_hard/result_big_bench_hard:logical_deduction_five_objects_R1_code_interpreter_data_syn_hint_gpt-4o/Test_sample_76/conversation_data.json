    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given clues:\n\n1. The owl is the second from the right.\n2. The robin is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the right of the blue jay.\n4. The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n\nLet's analyze these clues step by step:\n\n- Since the owl is the second from the right, the possible positions for the owl are 4th or 2nd from the left. However, since the robin is the second from the left, the owl must be 4th from the left.\n\n- The robin is the second from the left, so its position is fixed as 2nd.\n\n- The robin is to the right of the blue jay, so the blue jay must be in the 1st position.\n\n- The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk. Since the owl is in the 4th position, the only positions left for the hawk and the hummingbird are 3rd and 5th. Therefore, the hawk must be in the 3rd position, and the hummingbird must be in the 5th position.\n\nNow, let's list the positions of the birds from left to right:\n\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Owl\n5. Hummingbird\n\nFrom this arrangement, we can see that the hawk is the third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(D) The hawk is the third from the left\n\n<<<answer>>>"
