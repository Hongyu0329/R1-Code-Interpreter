    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The orange book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The green book is the rightmost.\n3. The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n4. The orange book is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the orange book is the third from the left, the order of the books from left to right starts with two books, then the orange book, and then two more books.\n- The green book is the rightmost, so it must be the fifth book.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the blue book, so the blue book must be to the left of the yellow book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the books:\n\n1. The orange book is third from the left.\n2. The green book is the fifth book.\n3. The yellow book must be to the right of the blue book.\n\nLet's place the books:\n\n- Position 1: Blue book (since yellow must be to the right of blue)\n- Position 2: Yellow book\n- Position 3: Orange book\n- Position 4: Brown book (since green is the rightmost)\n- Position 5: Green book\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The green book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the rightmost.\n(B) The orange book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's third from the left.\n(C) The brown book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's fourth.\n(D) The yellow book is the second from the left - Correct, as per our arrangement.\n(E) The blue book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's first.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
