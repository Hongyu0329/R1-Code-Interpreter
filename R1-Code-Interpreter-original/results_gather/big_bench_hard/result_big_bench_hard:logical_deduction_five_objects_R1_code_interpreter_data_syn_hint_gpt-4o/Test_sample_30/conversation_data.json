    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The robin is the second from the left.\n2. The quail is the leftmost.\n3. The blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.\n4. The hawk is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the quail is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n- The robin is the second from the left, so it occupies the second position.\n- The hawk is the third from the left, so it occupies the third position.\n\nNow, we have the following partial order:\n1. Quail\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. ?\n5. ?\n\nThe blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird. Therefore, the blue jay cannot be in the fifth position. The only positions left for the blue jay and the hummingbird are the fourth and fifth positions. Since the blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird, the blue jay must be in the fourth position, and the hummingbird must be in the fifth position.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Quail\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n(A) The quail is the rightmost - Incorrect, the quail is the leftmost.\n(B) The hummingbird is the rightmost - Correct, the hummingbird is in the fifth position.\n(C) The blue jay is the rightmost - Incorrect, the blue jay is in the fourth position.\n(D) The hawk is the rightmost - Incorrect, the hawk is in the third position.\n(E) The robin is the rightmost - Incorrect, the robin is in the second position.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
