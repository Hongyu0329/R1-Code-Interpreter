    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the owl.\n2. The hummingbird is to the right of the cardinal.\n3. The crow is to the left of the robin.\n4. The owl is to the left of the crow.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- From condition 1, we know: Hummingbird (H) is to the left of Owl (O).\n- From condition 2, we know: Cardinal (C) is to the left of Hummingbird (H).\n- From condition 3, we know: Crow (Cr) is to the left of Robin (R).\n- From condition 4, we know: Owl (O) is to the left of Crow (Cr).\n\nNow, let's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Start with the cardinal (C) since it is to the left of the hummingbird (H).\n2. Place the hummingbird (H) next, as it is to the right of the cardinal (C).\n3. The owl (O) must be to the right of the hummingbird (H) but to the left of the crow (Cr).\n4. The crow (Cr) must be to the right of the owl (O) but to the left of the robin (R).\n\nThe only arrangement that satisfies all these conditions is:\n- Cardinal (C)\n- Hummingbird (H)\n- Owl (O)\n- Crow (Cr)\n- Robin (R)\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is second from the left:\n- The order is: C, H, O, Cr, R\n- The second bird from the left is the Hummingbird (H).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The hummingbird is the second from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
