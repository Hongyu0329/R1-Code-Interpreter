    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and then identify which book is third from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The white book is to the left of the yellow book.\n3. The blue book is the second from the right.\n4. The purple book is the second from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the blue book is second from the right, the possible positions for the blue book are 4th.\n- The purple book is second from the left, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n- The white book is to the left of the yellow book, so it must be in one of the first three positions.\n- The blue book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book must be in one of the first three positions.\n- The only position left for the yellow book, considering the blue book is 4th, is the 3rd position.\n- The white book must be in the 1st position because it is to the left of the yellow book.\n- The only position left for the green book is the 5th position.\n\nSo, the order from left to right is: White, Purple, Yellow, Blue, Green.\n\nNow, let's identify which book is third from the left:\n\n- 1st: White\n- 2nd: Purple\n- 3rd: Yellow\n- 4th: Blue\n- 5th: Green\n\nThe yellow book is third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(E) The yellow book is the third from the left\n\n<<<answer>>>"
