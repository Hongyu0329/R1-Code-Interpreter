    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the third from the left.\n2. The yellow book is to the left of the black book.\n3. The green book is to the left of the purple book.\n4. The blue book is to the left of the green book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the purple book is the third from the left, the order of the books can be represented as: [_, _, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The green book is to the left of the purple book, so it must be in one of the first two positions: [Green, _, Purple, _, _] or [_, Green, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The blue book is to the left of the green book, so it must be in the first position: [Blue, Green, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The yellow book is to the left of the black book, so the remaining two positions (4th and 5th) must be occupied by the yellow and black books, with yellow coming before black: [Blue, Green, Purple, Yellow, Black].\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The blue book is the leftmost - This is consistent with our arrangement.\n(B) The purple book is the leftmost - This is not consistent.\n(C) The yellow book is the leftmost - This is not consistent.\n(D) The black book is the leftmost - This is not consistent.\n(E) The green book is the leftmost - This is not consistent.\n\nThe only option that matches our arrangement is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
