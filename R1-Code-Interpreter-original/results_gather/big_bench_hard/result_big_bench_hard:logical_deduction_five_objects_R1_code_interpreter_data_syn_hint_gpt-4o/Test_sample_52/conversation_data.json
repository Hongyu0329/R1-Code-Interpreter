    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given statements:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than loquats.\n2. Watermelons are less expensive than kiwis.\n3. Loquats are more expensive than apples.\n4. Cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that cantaloupes are the cheapest. This eliminates options (A), (B), (D), and (E) because they all suggest a different fruit as the cheapest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the remaining statements to confirm the order:\n\n- Since cantaloupes are the cheapest, they are at the bottom of the price list.\n- From statement 3, loquats are more expensive than apples, so apples are cheaper than loquats.\n- From statement 1, watermelons are more expensive than loquats, so loquats are cheaper than watermelons.\n- From statement 2, watermelons are less expensive than kiwis, so watermelons are cheaper than kiwis.\n\nPutting this all together, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Apples\n3. Loquats\n4. Watermelons\n5. Kiwis\n\nThis confirms that cantaloupes are indeed the cheapest, which matches option (C).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) The cantaloupes are the cheapest"
