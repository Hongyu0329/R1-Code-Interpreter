    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The raven is to the right of the owl.\n2. The raven is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the left of the crow.\n4. The robin is the second from the right.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 2, the raven is the second from the left. This means the raven is in position 2.\n- From condition 4, the robin is the second from the right. This means the robin is in position 4.\n- From condition 1, the raven is to the right of the owl. Since the raven is in position 2, the owl must be in position 1.\n- From condition 3, the robin is to the left of the crow. Since the robin is in position 4, the crow must be in position 5.\n\nNow, we have the following positions:\n1. Owl\n2. Raven\n3. ?\n4. Robin\n5. Crow\n\nThe only bird left is the cardinal, which must be in position 3.\n\nThus, the order of the birds from left to right is:\n1. Owl\n2. Raven\n3. Cardinal\n4. Robin\n5. Crow\n\nNow, we can determine which bird is the leftmost:\n- The owl is the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The owl is the leftmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
