    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Mel.\n2. Mel finished above Dan.\n3. Joe finished below Dan.\n4. Ada finished second.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Ada finished second, there is one golfer who finished above her. Let's denote this golfer as X.\n- Mel must be below Ada but above Dan, so Mel can be third or fourth.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe must be fifth.\n- Dan must be fourth because Joe is below him and Mel is above him.\n\nNow, let's arrange the golfers based on these deductions:\n\n1. X (unknown golfer)\n2. Ada\n3. Mel\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nSince Rob is the only golfer not mentioned in the conditions, he must be the one who finished first.\n\nThus, the order is:\n1. Rob\n2. Ada\n3. Mel\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nTherefore, Mel finished third.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E) Mel finished third.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
