    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. Mangoes are more expensive than loquats.\n2. Cantaloupes are more expensive than mangoes.\n3. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n4. Pears are the cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Since pears are the cheapest, they must be in the last position.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, which are more expensive than mangoes, which are more expensive than loquats. This gives us a partial order: Watermelons > Cantaloupes > Mangoes > Loquats.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Pears (cheapest)\n2. Loquats\n3. Mangoes\n4. Cantaloupes\n5. Watermelons (most expensive)\n\nFrom this order, we can see that the mangoes are the third-most expensive fruit.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
