    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is the leftmost.\n2. The red book is the third from the left.\n3. The white book is to the right of the gray book.\n4. The red book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the blue book is the leftmost, it is in the first position.\n- The red book is the third from the left, so it is in the third position.\n- The red book is to the left of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be in the second position. It must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The white book is to the right of the gray book, so the white book must be in the fifth position if the gray book is in the fourth position.\n\nNow, let's place the books:\n\n1. Blue book\n2. (Unknown)\n3. Red book\n4. Gray book\n5. White book\n\nThe only book left is the purple book, which must be in the second position.\n\nThe final order of the books is:\n1. Blue book\n2. Purple book\n3. Red book\n4. Gray book\n5. White book\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which book is the second from the right:\n\n- The second from the right is the gray book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The gray book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>> (D) The gray book is the second from the right"
