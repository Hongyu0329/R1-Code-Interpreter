    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The hawk is to the left of the owl.\n2. The raven is the second from the right.\n3. The robin is to the left of the raven.\n4. The owl is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the owl is the second from the left, the possible positions for the owl are 2nd.\n- The hawk must be to the left of the owl, so the hawk must be in the 1st position.\n- The raven is the second from the right, which means the raven is in the 4th position.\n- The robin is to the left of the raven, so the robin must be in the 3rd position.\n- The only remaining position is the 5th position, which must be occupied by the crow.\n\nThus, the order of the birds from left to right is: Hawk, Owl, Robin, Raven, Crow.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The owl is the rightmost - Incorrect, the owl is second from the left.\n(B) The hawk is the rightmost - Incorrect, the hawk is the leftmost.\n(C) The robin is the rightmost - Incorrect, the robin is in the middle.\n(D) The crow is the rightmost - Correct, the crow is in the 5th position.\n(E) The raven is the rightmost - Incorrect, the raven is second from the right.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The crow is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
