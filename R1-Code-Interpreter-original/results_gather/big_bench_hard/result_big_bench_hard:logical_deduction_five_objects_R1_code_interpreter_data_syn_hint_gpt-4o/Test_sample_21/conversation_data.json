    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The convertible is newer than the truck.\n2. The station wagon is newer than the hatchback.\n3. The convertible is older than the hatchback.\n4. The station wagon is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know: Convertible > Truck\n- From statement 2, we know: Station Wagon > Hatchback\n- From statement 3, we know: Hatchback > Convertible\n- From statement 4, we know: Station Wagon is the second-newest.\n\nCombining statements 1 and 3, we get: Hatchback > Convertible > Truck.\n\nSince the station wagon is the second-newest, it must be newer than the convertible and the truck, but older than the newest vehicle. Therefore, the order from oldest to newest must be:\n\n1. Truck\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Station Wagon\n5. Newest vehicle\n\nThe only vehicle not mentioned in the order so far is the motorcycle. Therefore, the motorcycle must be the newest.\n\nThus, the order is: Truck, Convertible, Hatchback, Station Wagon, Motorcycle.\n\nThe motorcycle is the newest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C) The motorcycle is the newest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
