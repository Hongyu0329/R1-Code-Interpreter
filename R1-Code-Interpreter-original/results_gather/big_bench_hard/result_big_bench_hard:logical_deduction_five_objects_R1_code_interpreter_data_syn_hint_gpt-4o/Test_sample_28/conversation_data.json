    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Joe finished second.\n2. Joe finished below Amy.\n3. Mel finished second-to-last.\n4. Ada finished last.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since Joe finished second, he cannot be first, third, fourth, or fifth.\n- Joe finished below Amy, so Amy must be first.\n- Mel finished second-to-last, which means Mel is fourth.\n- Ada finished last, which means Ada is fifth.\n\nGiven these positions:\n- Amy must be first because Joe is second and he finished below Amy.\n- Joe is second.\n- Rob must be third because Mel is fourth and Ada is fifth.\n\nThus, the order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Rob\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nTherefore, Amy finished first.\n\nThe correct option is (A) Amy finished first.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
