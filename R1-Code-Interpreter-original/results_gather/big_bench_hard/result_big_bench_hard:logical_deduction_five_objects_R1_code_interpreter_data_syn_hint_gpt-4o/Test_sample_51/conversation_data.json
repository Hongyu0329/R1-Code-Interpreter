    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the third from the left.\n2. The yellow book is to the left of the black book.\n3. The green book is to the left of the purple book.\n4. The blue book is to the left of the green book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the purple book is the third from the left, the order of the books can be represented as: [_, _, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The green book must be to the left of the purple book, so it can be in the first or second position: [Green, _, Purple, _, _] or [_, Green, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The blue book is to the left of the green book, so it must be in the first position if the green book is in the second position: [Blue, Green, Purple, _, _].\n\n- The yellow book is to the left of the black book. Since the first three positions are occupied by Blue, Green, and Purple, the yellow and black books must be in the fourth and fifth positions. The yellow book must be in the fourth position, and the black book in the fifth position: [Blue, Green, Purple, Yellow, Black].\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The blue book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the first.\n(B) The purple book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the third.\n(C) The yellow book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the fourth.\n(D) The black book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's the fifth.\n(E) The green book is the second from the left - Correct, as per our arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
