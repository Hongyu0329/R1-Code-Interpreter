    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The cardinal is the leftmost.\n2. The blue jay is the third from the left.\n3. The raven is to the right of the blue jay.\n4. The robin is to the right of the raven.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the cardinal is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The blue jay is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The raven is to the right of the blue jay, so it must be in either the fourth or fifth position.\n- The robin is to the right of the raven, so the robin must be in the fifth position if the raven is in the fourth position.\n\nLet's place the birds in order based on these deductions:\n\n1. Cardinal\n2. Quail (since the blue jay is third and the raven and robin are fourth and fifth, the quail must be second)\n3. Blue Jay\n4. Raven\n5. Robin\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is the rightmost. From the order above, the robin is in the fifth position, making it the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The robin is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
