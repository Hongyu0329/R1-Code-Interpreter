    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. Peaches are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches.\n3. Kiwis are the third-most expensive.\n4. Loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know: Oranges < Peaches\n- From statement 2, we know: Peaches < Cantaloupes\n- From statement 3, we know: Kiwis are the third-most expensive.\n- From statement 4, we know: Loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nGiven that there are five fruits, let's denote their prices in increasing order as F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, where F1 is the cheapest and F5 is the most expensive.\n\nFrom statement 4, Loquats are the second-cheapest, so:\n- F2 = Loquats\n\nFrom statement 3, Kiwis are the third-most expensive, so:\n- F3 = Kiwis\n\nNow, we need to place Oranges, Peaches, and Cantaloupes in the remaining positions (F1, F4, F5) while respecting the order:\n- Oranges < Peaches < Cantaloupes\n\nThe only way to satisfy all conditions is:\n- F1 = Oranges\n- F4 = Peaches\n- F5 = Cantaloupes\n\nThus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Oranges\n2. Loquats\n3. Kiwis\n4. Peaches\n5. Cantaloupes\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n(A) The oranges are the most expensive - Incorrect\n(B) The cantaloupes are the most expensive - Correct\n(C) The peaches are the most expensive - Incorrect\n(D) The loquats are the most expensive - Incorrect\n(E) The kiwis are the most expensive - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
