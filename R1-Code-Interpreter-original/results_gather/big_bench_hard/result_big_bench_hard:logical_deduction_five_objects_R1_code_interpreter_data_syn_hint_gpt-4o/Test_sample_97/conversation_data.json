    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The peaches are more expensive than the oranges.\n2. The cantaloupes are more expensive than the peaches.\n3. The kiwis are the third-most expensive.\n4. The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that oranges are cheaper than peaches.\n- From statement 2, we know that peaches are cheaper than cantaloupes.\n- From statement 3, kiwis are the third-most expensive, which means there are two fruits cheaper than kiwis and two fruits more expensive than kiwis.\n- From statement 4, loquats are the second-cheapest, which means there is only one fruit cheaper than loquats.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. The cheapest fruit\n2. Loquats (second-cheapest)\n3. Kiwis (third-most expensive)\n4. Peaches or Cantaloupes\n5. Cantaloupes or Peaches\n\nSince loquats are the second-cheapest, the only fruit that can be cheaper than loquats is the oranges. Therefore, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n\n1. Oranges\n2. Loquats\n3. Kiwis\n4. Peaches\n5. Cantaloupes\n\nThus, the oranges are the cheapest fruit.\n\nThe correct option is (A) The oranges are the cheapest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
