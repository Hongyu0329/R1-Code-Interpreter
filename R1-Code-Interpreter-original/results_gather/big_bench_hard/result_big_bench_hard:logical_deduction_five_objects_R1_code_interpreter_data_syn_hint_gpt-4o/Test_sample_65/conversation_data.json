    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and then identify which book is second from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the gray book.\n2. The brown book is the third from the left.\n3. The gray book is the second from the right.\n4. The yellow book is to the left of the green book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's arrange the books:\n\n- Since the gray book is the second from the right, the order from the right is: [_, Gray, _].\n- The brown book is the third from the left, so the order from the left is: [_, _, Brown, _].\n- The green book is to the left of the gray book, so it must be in one of the first three positions.\n- The yellow book is to the left of the green book, so it must be in one of the first two positions.\n\nLet's fill in the positions:\n\n1. The gray book is second from the right, so the fourth position is Gray.\n2. The brown book is third from the left, so the third position is Brown.\n3. The green book must be to the left of the gray book, so it can be in the first or second position.\n4. The yellow book must be to the left of the green book, so it must be in the first position if the green book is in the second position.\n\nLet's try to fill in the positions:\n\n- Position 1: Yellow\n- Position 2: Green\n- Position 3: Brown\n- Position 4: Gray\n- Position 5: Orange (since it's the only one left)\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The green book is to the left of the gray book: True (Position 2 is left of Position 4).\n- The brown book is the third from the left: True (Position 3).\n- The gray book is the second from the right: True (Position 4).\n- The yellow book is to the left of the green book: True (Position 1 is left of Position 2).\n\nThe order is: Yellow, Green, Brown, Gray, Orange.\n\nThe book that is second from the right is the Gray book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The gray book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) The gray book is the second from the right."
