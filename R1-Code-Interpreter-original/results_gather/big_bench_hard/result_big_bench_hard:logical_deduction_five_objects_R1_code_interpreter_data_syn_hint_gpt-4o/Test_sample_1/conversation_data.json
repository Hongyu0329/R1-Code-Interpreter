    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The tractor is older than the bus.\n2. The minivan is newer than the bus.\n3. The hatchback is the second-newest.\n4. The minivan is older than the convertible.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know: Tractor > Bus\n- From statement 2, we know: Minivan > Bus\n- From statement 3, we know: Hatchback is the second-newest, so there is only one vehicle newer than the hatchback.\n- From statement 4, we know: Minivan > Convertible\n\nNow, let's try to arrange these vehicles:\n\n1. Since the hatchback is the second-newest, it means there is one vehicle newer than it. The only vehicle that can be newer than the hatchback is the convertible because the minivan is older than the convertible. So, the convertible is the newest.\n\n2. The order from newest to oldest is: Convertible, Hatchback, Minivan, Bus, Tractor.\n\n3. Therefore, the second-oldest vehicle is the bus.\n\nThus, the correct option is (B) The bus is the second-oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The bus is the second-oldest"
