    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the sedan.\n2. The tractor is older than the hatchback.\n3. The minivan is the third-newest.\n4. The station wagon is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the minivan is the third-newest, there are two vehicles newer than it. According to condition 4, the station wagon is the second-newest, which means there is one vehicle newer than the station wagon. Therefore, the order from newest to oldest for these three vehicles is: [Newest, Station Wagon, Minivan].\n\n- The minivan is older than the sedan, so the sedan must be one of the two newest vehicles. Since the station wagon is the second-newest, the sedan must be the newest. Therefore, the order from newest to oldest is: [Sedan, Station Wagon, Minivan].\n\n- Now, we need to place the tractor and the hatchback. According to condition 2, the tractor is older than the hatchback. Therefore, the hatchback must be the fourth-newest, and the tractor must be the oldest.\n\nThe final order from oldest to newest is: [Tractor, Hatchback, Minivan, Station Wagon, Sedan].\n\nNow, we can determine which vehicle is the second-oldest. According to the order, the second-oldest vehicle is the hatchback.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) The hatchback is the second-oldest"
