    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The oranges are more expensive than the mangoes.\n2. The plums are the cheapest.\n3. The apples are less expensive than the mangoes.\n4. The pears are more expensive than the oranges.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 2, we know that plums are the cheapest, so they are in the first position.\n- From statement 3, apples are less expensive than mangoes, so apples are cheaper than mangoes.\n- From statement 1, oranges are more expensive than mangoes, so oranges are more expensive than both apples and mangoes.\n- From statement 4, pears are more expensive than oranges, so pears are the most expensive.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Plums (cheapest)\n2. Apples (since they are cheaper than mangoes)\n3. Mangoes (since they are more expensive than apples but cheaper than oranges)\n4. Oranges (since they are more expensive than mangoes but cheaper than pears)\n5. Pears (most expensive)\n\nBased on this order, the second-cheapest fruit is apples.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The apples are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
