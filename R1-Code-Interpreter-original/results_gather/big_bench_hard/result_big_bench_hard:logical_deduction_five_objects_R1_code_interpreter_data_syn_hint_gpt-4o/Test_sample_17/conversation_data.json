    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The owl is the leftmost.\n2. The robin is to the left of the raven.\n3. The quail is the rightmost.\n4. The raven is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- Since the owl is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The raven is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The quail is the rightmost, so it must be in the fifth position.\n- The robin is to the left of the raven, so it must be in the second position.\n- This leaves the falcon to be in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the order of the birds from left to right is: Owl, Robin, Raven, Falcon, Quail.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The quail is the second from the right - This is true because the quail is in the fifth position, which is the rightmost, and the second from the right is the fourth position, which is occupied by the falcon.\n\n(B) The owl is the second from the right - This is false because the owl is the leftmost.\n\n(C) The raven is the second from the right - This is false because the raven is in the third position.\n\n(D) The falcon is the second from the right - This is true because the falcon is in the fourth position.\n\n(E) The robin is the second from the right - This is false because the robin is in the second position.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The falcon is the second from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>> (D) The falcon is the second from the right."
