    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The orange book is to the right of the red book.\n3. The blue book is the rightmost.\n4. The gray book is to the left of the red book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the blue book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the left of the red book, so the red book cannot be in the 1st position.\n- The orange book is to the right of the red book, so the orange book cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. The yellow book must be to the left of the gray book, so it could be in the 1st or 2nd position.\n2. The gray book must be to the left of the red book, so it could be in the 2nd or 3rd position.\n3. The red book must be to the left of the orange book, so it could be in the 3rd or 4th position.\n4. The blue book is in the 5th position.\n\nLet's try to place them:\n\n- If the yellow book is in the 1st position, the gray book can be in the 2nd position, the red book in the 3rd position, and the orange book in the 4th position. This satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, the order is: Yellow, Gray, Red, Orange, Blue.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The gray book is the second from the left - This is true based on our arrangement.\n(B) The red book is the second from the left - This is false.\n(C) The yellow book is the second from the left - This is false.\n(D) The blue book is the second from the left - This is false.\n(E) The orange book is the second from the left - This is false.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The gray book is the second from the left"
