    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Mel finished first.\n2. Eve finished last.\n3. Amy finished below Dan.\n4. Joe finished above Dan.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's analyze the possible positions for each golfer:\n\n- Since Mel finished first, the order starts with Mel.\n- Eve finished last, so the order ends with Eve.\n- Joe finished above Dan, so Joe must be in a position before Dan.\n- Amy finished below Dan, so Amy must be in a position after Dan.\n\nLet's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n1. Mel\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. ?\n5. Eve\n\nSince Joe must be above Dan, and Amy must be below Dan, the only possible order for the remaining golfers is:\n\n1. Mel\n2. Joe\n3. Dan\n4. Amy\n5. Eve\n\nNow, we can see that Joe finished second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (D) Joe finished second"
