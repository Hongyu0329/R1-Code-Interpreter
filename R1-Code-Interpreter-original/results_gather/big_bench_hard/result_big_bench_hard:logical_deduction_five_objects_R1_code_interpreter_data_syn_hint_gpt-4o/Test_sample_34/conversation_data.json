    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Eve finished first.\n2. Rob finished above Mya.\n3. Joe finished above Eli.\n4. Joe finished below Mya.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since Eve finished first, the order starts with Eve.\n- Rob finished above Mya, so Rob must be placed before Mya in the order.\n- Joe finished above Eli, so Joe must be placed before Eli in the order.\n- Joe finished below Mya, so Mya must be placed before Joe in the order.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to construct the order:\n\n1. Eve\n2. Rob\n3. Mya\n4. Joe\n5. Eli\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions with this order:\n\n- Eve is first, which satisfies condition 1.\n- Rob is above Mya, which satisfies condition 2.\n- Joe is above Eli, which satisfies condition 3.\n- Joe is below Mya, which satisfies condition 4.\n\nThe order satisfies all the conditions. Now, we need to determine who finished second-to-last, which is the fourth position in the order.\n\nIn the order we constructed, Joe is in the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Joe finished second-to-last"
