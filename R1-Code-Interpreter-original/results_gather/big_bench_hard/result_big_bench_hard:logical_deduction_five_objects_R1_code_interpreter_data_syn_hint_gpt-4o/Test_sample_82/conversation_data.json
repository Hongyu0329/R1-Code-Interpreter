    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n2. Mangoes are less expensive than pears.\n3. Apples are the second-cheapest.\n4. Watermelons are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 3, we know that apples are the second-cheapest. This means there is only one fruit cheaper than apples.\n- From statement 1, watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes. This implies cantaloupes are cheaper than watermelons.\n- From statement 4, watermelons are less expensive than mangoes. This implies mangoes are more expensive than watermelons.\n- From statement 2, mangoes are less expensive than pears. This implies pears are more expensive than mangoes.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Cantaloupes (cheapest, since watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes)\n2. Apples (second-cheapest, as given)\n3. Watermelons (since they are more expensive than cantaloupes but less expensive than mangoes)\n4. Mangoes (since they are more expensive than watermelons but less expensive than pears)\n5. Pears (most expensive, since they are more expensive than mangoes)\n\nBased on this order, the third-most expensive fruit is watermelons.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The watermelons are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
