    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the left of the yellow book.\n2. The white book is to the left of the red book.\n3. The black book is to the right of the red book.\n4. The black book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 3, the black book is to the right of the red book, so the red book cannot be the rightmost.\n- From condition 4, the black book is to the left of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be the rightmost.\n- From condition 1, the gray book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book could potentially be the rightmost.\n- From condition 2, the white book is to the left of the red book, so the white book cannot be the rightmost.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the black book is to the right of the red book and to the left of the gray book, the order must be: Red, Black, Gray.\n- The white book is to the left of the red book, so it must be: White, Red, Black, Gray.\n- The gray book is to the left of the yellow book, so the final order is: White, Red, Black, Gray, Yellow.\n\nThus, the yellow book is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The yellow book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
