    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Mel finished first.\n2. Amy finished below Dan.\n3. Joe finished above Dan.\n4. Eve finished last.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Mel finished first, the order starts with Mel.\n- Eve finished last, so the order ends with Eve.\n- Joe finished above Dan, which means Joe cannot be last or second-to-last.\n- Amy finished below Dan, which means Amy cannot be above Dan.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to construct the order:\n\n1. Mel\n2. Joe (since Joe must be above Dan and cannot be last or second-to-last)\n3. Dan (since Amy must be below Dan)\n4. Amy (since Amy is below Dan)\n5. Eve\n\nNow, let's check the options for who finished second-to-last:\n\n- (A) Mel finished second-to-last: Incorrect, Mel finished first.\n- (B) Dan finished second-to-last: Incorrect, Dan finished third.\n- (C) Amy finished second-to-last: Correct, Amy finished fourth.\n- (D) Joe finished second-to-last: Incorrect, Joe finished second.\n- (E) Eve finished second-to-last: Incorrect, Eve finished last.\n\nThe correct answer is that Amy finished second-to-last.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Amy finished second-to-last"
