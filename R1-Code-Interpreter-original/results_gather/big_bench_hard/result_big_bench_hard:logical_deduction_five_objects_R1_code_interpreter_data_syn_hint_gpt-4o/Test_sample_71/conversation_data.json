    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints in the paragraph.\n\n1. **Constraints:**\n   - Loquats are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n   - Cantaloupes are less expensive than apples.\n   - Oranges are the most expensive.\n   - Apples are the third-most expensive.\n\n2. **Order of Prices:**\n   - Since oranges are the most expensive, they are at the top of the list.\n   - Apples are the third-most expensive, so there are two fruits more expensive than apples.\n   - Cantaloupes are less expensive than apples, so they must be fourth or fifth.\n   - Loquats are less expensive than cantaloupes, so they must be fifth.\n\n3. **Arranging the Fruits:**\n   - Oranges (most expensive)\n   - [Unknown]\n   - Apples (third-most expensive)\n   - Cantaloupes\n   - Loquats (least expensive)\n\n4. **Determining the Second-Most Expensive:**\n   - Since oranges are the most expensive and apples are the third-most expensive, the second-most expensive fruit must be the one that is not yet placed, which is peaches.\n\n5. **Determining the Second-Cheapest:**\n   - The order from least to most expensive is: Loquats, Cantaloupes, Apples, Peaches, Oranges.\n   - Therefore, the second-cheapest fruit is cantaloupes.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct option is (D) The cantaloupes are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
