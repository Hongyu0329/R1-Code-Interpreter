    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is the rightmost.\n2. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n4. The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the green book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book must be to the left of the gray book.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book must be to the right of the purple book.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book, so the gray book must be to the left of the purple book.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. The green book is in position 5.\n2. The gray book must be to the left of the purple book, and the purple book must be to the left of the yellow book. Therefore, the order of these three books must be gray, purple, yellow.\n3. The orange book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible order is:\n- Orange book\n- Gray book\n- Purple book\n- Yellow book\n- Green book\n\nThus, the orange book is the leftmost.\n\nThe correct option is (B) The orange book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
