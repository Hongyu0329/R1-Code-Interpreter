    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The cardinal is the leftmost.\n2. The robin is to the right of the raven.\n3. The raven is to the right of the blue jay.\n4. The blue jay is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the cardinal is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The blue jay is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The raven is to the right of the blue jay, so it must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The robin is to the right of the raven, so it must be in the fifth position if the raven is in the fourth position.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible arrangement is:\n1. Cardinal\n2. Quail\n3. Blue Jay\n4. Raven\n5. Robin\n\nNow, let's match this arrangement with the options provided:\n\n(A) The cardinal is the leftmost - This is true based on our arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
