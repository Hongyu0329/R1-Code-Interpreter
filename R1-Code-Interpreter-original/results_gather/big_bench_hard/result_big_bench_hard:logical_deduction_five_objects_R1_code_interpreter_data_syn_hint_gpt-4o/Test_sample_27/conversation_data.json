    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Mya finished first.\n2. Joe finished below Dan.\n3. Dan finished below Rob.\n4. Eve finished above Rob.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Mya finished first, the order starts with Mya.\n- Eve finished above Rob, so Eve cannot be last or second-to-last.\n- Dan finished below Rob, so Dan cannot be second or third.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe must be last.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to construct the order:\n\n1. Mya\n2. Eve (since she must be above Rob and cannot be last or second-to-last)\n3. Rob (since Dan is below Rob)\n4. Dan (since Joe is below Dan)\n5. Joe\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) Joe finished second-to-last - Incorrect, Joe finished last.\n(B) Eve finished second-to-last - Incorrect, Eve finished second.\n(C) Mya finished second-to-last - Incorrect, Mya finished first.\n(D) Rob finished second-to-last - Incorrect, Rob finished third.\n(E) Dan finished second-to-last - Correct, Dan finished fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is (E) Dan finished second-to-last.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
