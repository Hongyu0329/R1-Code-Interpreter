    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Joe finished second.\n2. Joe finished below Amy.\n3. Mel finished second-to-last.\n4. Ada finished last.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since Joe finished second, the order starts with someone else, followed by Joe.\n- Joe finished below Amy, so Amy must be in the first position.\n- Mel finished second-to-last, which means Mel is in the fourth position.\n- Ada finished last, which means Ada is in the fifth position.\n\nGiven these constraints, the order of finish is:\n\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Rob (since Rob is the only one left)\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) Amy finished last - Incorrect, Amy finished first.\n- (B) Mel finished last - Incorrect, Mel finished fourth.\n- (C) Rob finished last - Incorrect, Rob finished third.\n- (D) Joe finished last - Incorrect, Joe finished second.\n- (E) Ada finished last - Correct, Ada finished fifth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
