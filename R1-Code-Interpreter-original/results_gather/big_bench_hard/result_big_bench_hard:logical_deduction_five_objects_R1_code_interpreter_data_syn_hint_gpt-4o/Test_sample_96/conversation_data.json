    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given clues:\n\n1. The cardinal is the second from the right.\n2. The hawk is to the right of the falcon.\n3. The raven is the second from the left.\n4. The crow is the rightmost.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the crow is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The cardinal is the second from the right, so it must be in the 4th position.\n- The raven is the second from the left, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n- The hawk is to the right of the falcon, which means the falcon must be to the left of the hawk.\n\nNow, let's place the birds in order:\n\n1. The raven is in the 2nd position.\n2. The cardinal is in the 4th position.\n3. The crow is in the 5th position.\n\nThis leaves the 1st and 3rd positions for the falcon and the hawk. Since the hawk is to the right of the falcon, the falcon must be in the 1st position and the hawk in the 3rd position.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Falcon\n2. Raven\n3. Hawk\n4. Cardinal\n5. Crow\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The falcon is the leftmost - This is correct because the falcon is in the 1st position.\n\n(B) The raven is the leftmost - Incorrect, the raven is in the 2nd position.\n\n(C) The cardinal is the leftmost - Incorrect, the cardinal is in the 4th position.\n\n(D) The hawk is the leftmost - Incorrect, the hawk is in the 3rd position.\n\n(E) The crow is the leftmost - Incorrect, the crow is in the 5th position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
