    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the gray book.\n2. The brown book is the third from the left.\n3. The gray book is the second from the right.\n4. The yellow book is to the left of the green book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the gray book is the second from the right, it must be in the fourth position.\n- The brown book is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The green book must be to the left of the gray book, so it can only be in the first or second position.\n- The yellow book must be to the left of the green book, so it must be in the first position if the green book is in the second position.\n\nLet's place the books based on these deductions:\n\n1. Yellow book\n2. Green book\n3. Brown book\n4. Gray book\n5. Orange book\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The green book is to the left of the gray book: True (position 2 is left of position 4).\n- The brown book is the third from the left: True (position 3).\n- The gray book is the second from the right: True (position 4).\n- The yellow book is to the left of the green book: True (position 1 is left of position 2).\n\nThe orange book is in the fifth position, which is the rightmost position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) The orange book is the rightmost"
