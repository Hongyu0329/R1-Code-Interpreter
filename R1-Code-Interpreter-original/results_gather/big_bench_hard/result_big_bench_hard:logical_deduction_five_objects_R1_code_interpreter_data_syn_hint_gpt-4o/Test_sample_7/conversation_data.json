    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Mel.\n2. Mel finished above Dan.\n3. Joe finished below Dan.\n4. Ada finished second.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Ada finished second, there is one golfer who finished above her. This means Ada is not first.\n- Mel must be below Ada but above Dan. Therefore, Mel cannot be first or second.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe cannot be first, second, or third.\n- Since Ada is second, and Mel is below Ada, Mel can be third or fourth.\n- Dan must be below Mel, so Dan can be fourth or fifth.\n- Joe is below Dan, so Joe must be fifth.\n\nNow, let's try to place the golfers:\n\n- Ada is second.\n- Joe is last (fifth).\n- Mel is above Dan, so Mel can be third, and Dan can be fourth.\n\nThis leaves Rob as the only golfer who can be first, as Ada is second, Mel is third, Dan is fourth, and Joe is fifth.\n\nThe order is:\n1. Rob\n2. Ada\n3. Mel\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Joe finished last.\n\n<<<answer>>> D"
