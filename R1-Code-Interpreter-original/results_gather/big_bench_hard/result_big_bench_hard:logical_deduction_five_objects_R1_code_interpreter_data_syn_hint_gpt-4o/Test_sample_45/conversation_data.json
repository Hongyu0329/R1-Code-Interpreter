    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which bird is the rightmost.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. The robin is to the right of the cardinal.\n2. The cardinal is to the right of the blue jay.\n3. The blue jay is the second from the left.\n4. The crow is the rightmost.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know the blue jay is in the second position from the left. Let's denote the positions as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from left to right.\n\n- Position 2: Blue Jay\n\nFrom statement 2, the cardinal is to the right of the blue jay. Therefore, the cardinal can be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nFrom statement 1, the robin is to the right of the cardinal. Therefore, the robin can be in a position further right than the cardinal.\n\nFrom statement 4, the crow is the rightmost. Therefore, the crow is in position 5.\n\nNow, let's place the birds:\n\n- Position 5: Crow\n\nSince the crow is in position 5, the cardinal and robin must be in positions 3 and 4, respectively, because the robin is to the right of the cardinal.\n\n- Position 3: Cardinal\n- Position 4: Robin\n\nThe only bird left is the falcon, which must be in position 1.\n\n- Position 1: Falcon\n\nSo, the order from left to right is: Falcon, Blue Jay, Cardinal, Robin, Crow.\n\nThe rightmost bird is the crow.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The crow is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
