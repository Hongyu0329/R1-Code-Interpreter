The yellow book is to the right of the purple book.\n2. The black book is to the left of the purple book.\n3. The black book is the third from the left.\n4. The brown book is the leftmost.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's arrange the books:\n\n- The brown book is the leftmost, so it is in the first position.\n- The black book is the third from the left, so it is in the third position.\n- The black book is to the left of the purple book, so the purple book cannot be in the first or third position. It must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the purple book, so it must be in the fifth position if the purple book is in the fourth position.\n\nLet's place the books:\n\n1. Brown book\n2. (Unknown)\n3. Black book\n4. Purple book\n5. Yellow book\n\nThe only book left is the gray book, which must be in the second position.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Brown, Gray, Black, Purple, Yellow.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is second from the left:\n\n- The second book from the left is the Gray book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) The gray book is the second from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
