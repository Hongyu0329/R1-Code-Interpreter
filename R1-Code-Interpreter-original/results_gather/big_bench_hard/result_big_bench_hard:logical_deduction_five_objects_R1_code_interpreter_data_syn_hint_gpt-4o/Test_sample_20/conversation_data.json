    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n2. Mangoes are less expensive than pears.\n3. Apples are the second-cheapest.\n4. Watermelons are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 3, we know that apples are the second-cheapest. This directly gives us the position of apples in the order.\n- From statement 1, watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, so cantaloupes cannot be the most expensive.\n- From statement 4, watermelons are less expensive than mangoes, so mangoes cannot be the cheapest.\n- From statement 2, mangoes are less expensive than pears, so pears cannot be the cheapest.\n\nGiven that apples are the second-cheapest, let's consider the possible order:\n\n- The cheapest fruit must be cantaloupes because watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, and apples are the second-cheapest.\n- Therefore, the order from cheapest to most expensive is: Cantaloupes, Apples, Watermelons, Mangoes, Pears.\n\nNow, let's verify this order with the statements:\n\n- Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes (True).\n- Mangoes are less expensive than pears (True).\n- Apples are the second-cheapest (True).\n- Watermelons are less expensive than mangoes (True).\n\nAll statements are satisfied with this order. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B) The apples are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
