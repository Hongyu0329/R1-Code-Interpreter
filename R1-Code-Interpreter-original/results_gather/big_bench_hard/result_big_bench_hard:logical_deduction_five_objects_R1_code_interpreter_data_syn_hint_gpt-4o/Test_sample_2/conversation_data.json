    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the left of the green book.\n2. The gray book is the second from the right.\n3. The yellow book is to the right of the orange book.\n4. The blue book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the gray book is the second from the right, the possible positions for the gray book are 4th from the left.\n- The blue book is the second from the left, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n- The gray book is to the left of the green book, so the green book must be in the 5th position (rightmost).\n- The yellow book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book must be in the 1st position, and the yellow book must be in the 3rd position.\n\nNow, let's place the books in order:\n\n1. Orange book\n2. Blue book\n3. Yellow book\n4. Gray book\n5. Green book\n\nBased on this arrangement, the orange book is the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The orange book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
