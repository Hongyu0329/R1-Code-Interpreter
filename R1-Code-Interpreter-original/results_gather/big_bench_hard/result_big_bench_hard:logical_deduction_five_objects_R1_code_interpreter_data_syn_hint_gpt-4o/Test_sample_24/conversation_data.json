    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the books.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The yellow book is to the right of the purple book.\n2. The black book is to the left of the purple book.\n3. The black book is the third from the left.\n4. The brown book is the leftmost.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's arrange the books:\n\n- Since the brown book is the leftmost, it is in the first position.\n- The black book is the third from the left, so it is in the third position.\n- The purple book must be to the right of the black book, so it cannot be in the first or third position. It must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the purple book, so it cannot be in the fourth position if the purple book is there. Therefore, the purple book must be in the fourth position, and the yellow book must be in the fifth position.\n- The only position left for the gray book is the second position.\n\nThe order of the books from left to right is:\n1. Brown\n2. Gray\n3. Black\n4. Purple\n5. Yellow\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The yellow book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's fifth.\n(B) The brown book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's first.\n(C) The gray book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's second.\n(D) The black book is the third from the left - Correct.\n(E) The purple book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
