    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the sedan.\n2. The tractor is older than the hatchback.\n3. The minivan is the third-newest.\n4. The station wagon is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the minivan is the third-newest, there are two vehicles newer than it. \n- The station wagon is the second-newest, so it is one of the two vehicles newer than the minivan.\n- Therefore, the only vehicle that can be the newest is the sedan, as it is the only one left that can be newer than the station wagon.\n- The tractor is older than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the oldest.\n- The minivan cannot be the oldest because it is the third-newest.\n- The station wagon cannot be the oldest because it is the second-newest.\n- The sedan cannot be the oldest because it is the newest.\n\nThus, the only vehicle that can be the oldest is the tractor.\n\nTherefore, the order from oldest to newest is: Tractor, Hatchback, Minivan, Station Wagon, Sedan.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) The tractor is the oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
