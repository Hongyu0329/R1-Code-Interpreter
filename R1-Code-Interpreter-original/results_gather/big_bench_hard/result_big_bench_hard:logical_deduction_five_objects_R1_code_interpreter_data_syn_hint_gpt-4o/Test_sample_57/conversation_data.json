    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the birds.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The hawk is to the right of the owl.\n2. The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n3. The crow is the second from the right.\n4. The robin is the second from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the birds:\n\n- Since the crow is the second from the right, the arrangement must be: _ _ _ Crow _.\n- The robin is the second from the left, so the arrangement becomes: _ Robin _ Crow _.\n- The hawk is to the right of the owl, and the hummingbird is to the right of the hawk. Therefore, the only possible arrangement is: Owl Robin Hawk Crow Hummingbird.\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The owl is the second from the left - Incorrect, the owl is the first.\n(B) The hummingbird is the second from the left - Incorrect, the hummingbird is the last.\n(C) The crow is the second from the left - Incorrect, the crow is the fourth.\n(D) The hawk is the second from the left - Incorrect, the hawk is the third.\n(E) The robin is the second from the left - Correct, the robin is indeed the second from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) The robin is the second from the left"
