    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n2. The green book is the second from the right.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the white book.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- From condition 2, we know the green book is the second from the right. So, the possible positions for the green book are 4th position.\n- From condition 1, the gray book is to the right of the orange book. This means the orange book cannot be in the 5th position.\n- From condition 3, the brown book is to the right of the white book. This means the white book cannot be in the 5th position.\n- From condition 4, the brown book is to the left of the orange book. This means the brown book cannot be in the 5th position.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books:\n\n1. The green book is in the 4th position.\n2. The gray book must be in the 5th position because it is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The orange book must be in the 3rd position because it is to the left of the gray book.\n4. The brown book must be in the 2nd position because it is to the left of the orange book.\n5. The white book must be in the 1st position because it is to the left of the brown book.\n\nThe order of the books from left to right is: White, Brown, Orange, Green, Gray.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The white book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(B) The green book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(C) The brown book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(D) The gray book is the rightmost - Correct\n(E) The orange book is the rightmost - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The gray book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
