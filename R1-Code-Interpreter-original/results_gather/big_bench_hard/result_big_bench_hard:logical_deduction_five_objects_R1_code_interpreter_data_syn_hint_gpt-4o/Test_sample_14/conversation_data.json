    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The plums are less expensive than the kiwis.\n2. The plums are more expensive than the watermelons.\n3. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n4. The oranges are the most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 4, we know that oranges are the most expensive.\n- From statement 3, loquats are more expensive than kiwis.\n- From statement 1, kiwis are more expensive than plums.\n- From statement 2, plums are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nWe can now arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Watermelons < Plums < Kiwis < Loquats < Oranges\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The watermelons are the cheapest - This is consistent with our arrangement.\n(B) The oranges are the cheapest - This contradicts the given information that oranges are the most expensive.\n(C) The loquats are the cheapest - This contradicts the given information that loquats are more expensive than kiwis.\n(D) The plums are the cheapest - This contradicts the given information that plums are more expensive than watermelons.\n(E) The kiwis are the cheapest - This contradicts the given information that kiwis are more expensive than plums.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with the arrangement is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
