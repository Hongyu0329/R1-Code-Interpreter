    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is the leftmost.\n2. The red book is the third from the left.\n3. The white book is to the right of the gray book.\n4. The red book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the blue book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The red book is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n- The red book is to the left of the gray book, so the gray book must be in either the fourth or fifth position.\n- The white book is to the right of the gray book, so the white book must be in the fifth position if the gray book is in the fourth position.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the following order:\n\n1. Blue book\n2. (Unknown, but not red, gray, or white)\n3. Red book\n4. Gray book\n5. White book\n\nThe only book not mentioned yet is the purple book, which must be in the second position.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Blue, Purple, Red, Gray, White.\n\nNow, we can determine which book is the rightmost:\n\n- The rightmost book is the White book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The white book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
