    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Eli.\n2. Amy finished below Mel.\n3. Ada finished second.\n4. Mel finished below Eli.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Ada finished second, she cannot be first. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n- Ada finished above Eli, so Eli cannot be first. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.\n- Mel finished below Eli, so Mel cannot be first. Therefore, option (E) is not possible.\n- Amy finished below Mel, so Amy cannot be first. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.\n\nBy elimination, the only remaining option is (D) Joe finished first.\n\nLet's verify this by constructing the order:\n\n- Ada is second.\n- Eli must be below Ada, so Eli is third or lower.\n- Mel is below Eli, so Mel is fourth or fifth.\n- Amy is below Mel, so Amy is fifth.\n- Joe, therefore, must be first.\n\nThe order is: Joe, Ada, Eli, Mel, Amy.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (D) Joe finished first"
