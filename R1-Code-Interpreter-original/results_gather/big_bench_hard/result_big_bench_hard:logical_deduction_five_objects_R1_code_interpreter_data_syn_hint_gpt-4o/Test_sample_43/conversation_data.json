    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The raven is to the right of the owl.\n2. The raven is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the left of the crow.\n4. The robin is the second from the right.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the raven is the second from the left, the order starts with one bird, then the raven.\n- The robin is the second from the right, so there is one bird to the right of the robin.\n- The raven is to the right of the owl, so the owl must be the first bird.\n- The robin is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be the last bird.\n\nGiven these conditions, the order of the birds from left to right is:\n1. Owl\n2. Raven\n3. Cardinal\n4. Robin\n5. Crow\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is third from the left. In this order, the cardinal is third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The cardinal is the third from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
