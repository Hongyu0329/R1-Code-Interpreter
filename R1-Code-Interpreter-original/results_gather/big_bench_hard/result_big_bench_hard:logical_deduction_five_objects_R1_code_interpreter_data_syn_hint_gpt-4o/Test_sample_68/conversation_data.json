The bus is the oldest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 4, we know the bus is the oldest.\n- From statement 1, the sedan is the second-newest, so there is only one vehicle newer than the sedan.\n- From statement 3, the sedan is older than the motorcycle, so the motorcycle must be the newest.\n- From statement 2, the station wagon is newer than the convertible.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the order from oldest to newest:\n\n1. Bus (oldest)\n2. Convertible\n3. Station Wagon\n4. Sedan\n5.
