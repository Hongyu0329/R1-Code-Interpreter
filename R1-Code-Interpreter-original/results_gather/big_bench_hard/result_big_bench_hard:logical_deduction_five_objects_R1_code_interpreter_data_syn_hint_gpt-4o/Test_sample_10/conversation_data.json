    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n2. The pears are more expensive than the peaches.\n3. The apples are more expensive than the loquats.\n4. The apples are less expensive than the peaches.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know: Kiwis < Loquats\n- From statement 2, we know: Peaches < Pears\n- From statement 3, we know: Loquats < Apples\n- From statement 4, we know: Apples < Peaches\n\nCombining these inequalities, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- From statements 1 and 3: Kiwis < Loquats < Apples\n- From statements 4 and 2: Apples < Peaches < Pears\n\nNow, combining all the information, we get:\n\nKiwis < Loquats < Apples < Peaches < Pears\n\nWith this order, we can see that the second-cheapest fruit is the loquats.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(D) The loquats are the second-cheapest\n\n<<<answer>>>"
