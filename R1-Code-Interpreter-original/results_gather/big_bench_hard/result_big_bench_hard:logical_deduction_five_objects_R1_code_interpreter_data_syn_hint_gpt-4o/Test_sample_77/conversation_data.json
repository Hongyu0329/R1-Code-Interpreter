    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The tractor is newer than the minivan.\n2. The tractor is older than the limousine.\n3. The convertible is older than the sedan.\n4. The convertible is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 4, since the convertible is the second-newest, there is only one vehicle newer than the convertible. This means the convertible cannot be the oldest.\n- From statement 1, the minivan is older than the tractor.\n- From statement 2, the tractor is older than the limousine.\n- From statement 3, the convertible is older than the sedan.\n\nGiven that the convertible is the second-newest, the only vehicle that can be newer than the convertible is the limousine, as the tractor is older than the limousine. Therefore, the order from newest to oldest is:\n\n1. Limousine (newest)\n2. Convertible\n3. Sedan\n4. Tractor\n5. Minivan (oldest)\n\nThus, the minivan is the oldest vehicle.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D) The minivan is the oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
