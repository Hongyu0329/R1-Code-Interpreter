    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Amy finished above Eli.\n2. Ana finished above Amy.\n3. Mya finished below Eli.\n4. Dan finished last.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Dan finished last, he is in the 5th position.\n- Mya finished below Eli, so Mya cannot be 3rd or 4th. Since Dan is 5th, Mya must be 4th.\n- Amy finished above Eli, so Amy cannot be 3rd if Eli is 3rd. Therefore, Eli cannot be 3rd.\n- Ana finished above Amy, so Ana cannot be 3rd if Amy is 3rd.\n\nNow, let's determine the possible positions:\n\n- Since Dan is 5th and Mya is 4th, the remaining positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) are for Ana, Amy, and Eli.\n- Ana must be above Amy, so Ana cannot be 3rd.\n- Eli cannot be 3rd because Amy is above Eli.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility left is for Amy to be 3rd.\n\nThus, the order is:\n1. Ana\n2. Eli\n3. Amy\n4. Mya\n5. Dan\n\nAmy finished third.\n\nThe correct option is (E) Amy finished third.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
