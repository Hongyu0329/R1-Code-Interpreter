    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The quail is to the left of the blue jay.\n2. The cardinal is the third from the left.\n3. The quail is the second from the left.\n4. The blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 3, we know that the quail is the second from the left.\n- From statement 2, the cardinal is the third from the left.\n- From statement 1, the quail is to the left of the blue jay, so the blue jay cannot be first or second. Since the quail is second, the blue jay must be fourth or fifth.\n- From statement 4, the blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird, so the blue jay cannot be fifth. Therefore, the blue jay must be fourth.\n- Consequently, the hummingbird must be fifth.\n\nNow, we have the following order:\n1. Unknown\n2. Quail\n3. Cardinal\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n\nThe only bird left is the hawk, which must be first.\n\nThus, the order of the birds is:\n1. Hawk\n2. Quail\n3. Cardinal\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- Option (A): The blue jay is the second from the left. (Incorrect, it's fourth)\n- Option (B): The cardinal is the second from the left. (Incorrect, it's third)\n- Option (C): The hawk is the second from the left. (Incorrect, it's first)\n- Option (D): The hummingbird is the second from the left. (Incorrect, it's fifth)\n- Option (E): The quail is the second from the left. (Correct)\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
