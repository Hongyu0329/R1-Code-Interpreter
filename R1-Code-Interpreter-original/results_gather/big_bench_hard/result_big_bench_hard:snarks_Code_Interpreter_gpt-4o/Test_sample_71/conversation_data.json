    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically to mock or convey contempt. In this case, applying to 200 internships in a week is an unusually high number, so saying \"Wow, you only applied to 200 internships this past week?\" is likely sarcastic, as it implies that 200 is a small number when it is actually quite large.\n\nOn the other hand, applying to 2 internships in a week is a more reasonable number, so the statement \"Wow, you only applied to 2 internships this past week?\" is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Wow, you only applied to 200 internships this past week?"
