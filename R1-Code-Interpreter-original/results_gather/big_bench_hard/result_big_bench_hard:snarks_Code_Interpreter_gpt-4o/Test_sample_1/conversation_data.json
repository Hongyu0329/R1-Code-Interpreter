    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way. In this case:\n\n(A) \"Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore\" - This statement is likely sarcastic because it oversimplifies the complex issue of depression, suggesting that simply being happy is a solution, which is not realistic.\n\n(B) \"Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore\" - This statement seems more straightforward and lacks the ironic tone that would indicate sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
