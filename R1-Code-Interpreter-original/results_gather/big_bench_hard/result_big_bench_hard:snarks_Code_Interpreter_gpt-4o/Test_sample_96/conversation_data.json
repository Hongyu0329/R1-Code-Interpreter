    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically to mock or convey contempt. In this case, the statement that is sarcastic would be the one where the speaker pretends to be shocked by an outcome that is actually expected.\n\nOption (A) \"They're losing to a team with a terrible record. I for one am shocked\" is sarcastic because losing to a team with a terrible record is unexpected, and the speaker is pretending to be shocked by this expected outcome.\n\nOption (B) \"They're losing to a team with a winning record. I for one am shocked\" is not sarcastic because losing to a team with a winning record is expected, and the speaker's shock would be genuine if it were true.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
