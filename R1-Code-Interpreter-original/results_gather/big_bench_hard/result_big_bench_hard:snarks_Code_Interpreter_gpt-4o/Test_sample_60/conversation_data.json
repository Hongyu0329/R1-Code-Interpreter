    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this context, the statement that is sarcastic is likely the one that presents a contradiction or an ironic twist.\n\nOption (A) suggests that corporate restriction equals free speech, which is contradictory because restrictions typically limit speech rather than promote it.
