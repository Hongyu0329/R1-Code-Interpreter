    "\nassistant > Sarcasm is often used to mock or convey contempt, typically by saying the opposite of what is meant. In this case, option (A) \"Have you tried not being poor? It is much easier\" is sarcastic because it implies that being poor is a choice and that it's easy to not be poor, which is a simplification and mockery of the complex socio-economic issues related to poverty. \n\nOption (B) \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier\" is more straightforward and not sarcastic, as it suggests a behavioral change that is within a person's control.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
