    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically for humorous or emphatic effect. In this case, waiting two minutes is generally not considered a long time, so expressing that it's \"too long\" is likely sarcastic. On the other hand, waiting two hours is indeed a long time, so that statement is more likely to be sincere.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
