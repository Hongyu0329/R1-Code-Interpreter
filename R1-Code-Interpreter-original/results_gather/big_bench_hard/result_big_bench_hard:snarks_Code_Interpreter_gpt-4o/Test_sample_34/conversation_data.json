    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically for humorous or emphatic effect. In this case, the statement that is sarcastic is the one that exaggerates the situation to an absurd degree, suggesting the opposite of what is logically true.\n\nOption (B) \"Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe\" is sarcastic because a wheel wobbling several feet would clearly indicate that the bike is unsafe, yet the statement suggests otherwise.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe"
