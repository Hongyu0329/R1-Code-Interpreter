    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, the statement that is sarcastic is the one that pretends to praise someone for being \"rational\" while actually expressing disbelief or disagreement.\n\nOption (A) is sarcastic because it uses the phrase \"Have my up vote for being rational\" in a context where the speaker clearly disagrees with the idea of liking the system, as indicated by the phrase \"ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ???\"\n\nOption (B) is not sarcastic because it aligns the disbelief (\"ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ???\") with the action of giving a down vote, which is consistent with disagreement.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
