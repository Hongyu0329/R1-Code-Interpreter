    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this context, the statement that is sarcastic is the one that presents a negative trait as if it were a positive qualification for running a country, which is an ironic and mocking way to highlight the absurdity of the situation.\n\nOption (B) \"He's just demented. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!\" is sarcastic because it uses the term \"demented\" (a negative trait) and then ironically suggests that this is acceptable for running a country.\n\nOption (A) \"He's just kindhearted. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!\" is not sarcastic because being kindhearted is generally considered a positive trait, and the statement does not carry the same ironic or mocking tone.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B)"
