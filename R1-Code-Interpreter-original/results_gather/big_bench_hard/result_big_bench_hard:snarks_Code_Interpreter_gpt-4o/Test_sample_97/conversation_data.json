    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically to mock or convey contempt. In this context:\n\n- Statement (A) \"Just like Hitler. A True warrior\" could be sarcastic because calling Hitler a \"True warrior\" might be intended to mock or criticize him, given the negative historical connotations associated with his actions.\n\n- Statement (B) \"Just like Hitler.
