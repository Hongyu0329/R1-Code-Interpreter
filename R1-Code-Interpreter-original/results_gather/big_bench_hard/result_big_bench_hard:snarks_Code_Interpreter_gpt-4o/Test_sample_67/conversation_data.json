    "\nassistant > Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they really mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. In this case:\n\n- Option (A) \"A wave of hypothermia and drownings will be a great way to start the year\" is sarcastic because it uses the word \"great\" to describe something that is clearly negative and undesirable.\n- Option (B) \"A wave of hypothermia and drownings will be a terrible way to start the year\" is straightforward and not sarcastic, as it directly states the negative nature of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
