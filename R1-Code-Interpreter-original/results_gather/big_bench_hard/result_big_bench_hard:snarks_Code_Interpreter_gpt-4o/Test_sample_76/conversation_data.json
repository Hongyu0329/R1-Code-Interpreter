    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a humorous or mocking way. In this context:\n\n- Statement (A) \"Never had as much fun in my life as when the cops found my backpack of weed in my car trunk\" is likely sarcastic. The situation described is generally not fun, so claiming it was the most fun is likely meant sarcastically.\n- Statement (B) \"Never had as much anxiety in my life when the cops found my backpack of weed in my car trunk\" is likely sincere, as the situation would indeed be anxiety-inducing.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
