    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, the statement about \"feeding the trolls\" being a \"woefully endangered species\" is sarcastic. Trolls, in the context of internet culture, are not actually endangered, nor are they a species that one would typically want to preserve or feed. The statement is mocking the idea of trolls being something valuable or worth preserving.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species"
