    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this context:\n\n- Option (A) \"don't forget there are people in Antarctica\" is a straightforward statement, likely meant to remind someone of the presence of people in a remote location.\n- Option (B) \"don't forget there are people in suffering\" could be sarcastic if used in a context where someone is being reminded of something obvious or if the speaker is implying that the listener is ignoring an important issue.\n\nGiven these interpretations, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic, especially if used in a context where the speaker is highlighting the listener's neglect or indifference to suffering.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) don't forget there are people in suffering"
