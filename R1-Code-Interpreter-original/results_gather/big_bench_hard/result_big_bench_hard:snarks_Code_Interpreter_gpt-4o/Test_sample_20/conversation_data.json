    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually for humorous or emphatic effect. In this context, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is the one that suggests an exaggerated level of difficulty for something that is generally considered simple.\n\n(A) \"Working the printer is too complex for me\" could be sarcastic because using a printer is generally not considered highly complex, and the speaker might be implying that it should be easy.\n\n(B) \"Working the microprocessor is too complex for me\" is less likely to be sarcastic because working with microprocessors can indeed be complex, and the statement could be taken literally.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
