    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically to mock or convey contempt. In this case, the sarcastic statement would be the one that implies the opposite of what is expected when someone prepares for things ahead of time.\n\nOption (A) suggests that having a person who prepares ahead of time in office would be good, which is generally a positive statement. However, the use of \"God, to think of how good it could have been\" implies that the reality is not good, suggesting sarcasm.\n\nOption (B) suggests that having a person who prepares ahead of time in office would be bad, which is contrary to the usual expectation that preparation is beneficial. This statement is not sarcastic because it does not imply the opposite of what is expected.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
