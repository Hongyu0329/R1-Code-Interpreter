    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically to mock or convey contempt. In this case, the statement that is sarcastic is the one that pretends to express sympathy for someone who received a substantial reward, implying that the reward is insufficient when it is actually quite significant.\n\nOption (A) is sarcastic because receiving a $50,000 scholarship is generally considered a significant achievement, and the phrase \"What a poor guy\" is used ironically.\n\nOption (B) is not sarcastic because receiving a $50 scholarship after years of work could genuinely be seen as insufficient.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
