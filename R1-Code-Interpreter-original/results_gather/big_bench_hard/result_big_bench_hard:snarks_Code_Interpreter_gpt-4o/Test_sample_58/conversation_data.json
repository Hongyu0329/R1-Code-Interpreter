    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this context:\n\n- Option (A) \"You mean you're only into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?\" suggests that the speaker is incredulous or mocking the idea that someone would be exclusively interested in such a negative trait, which is likely not meant to be taken literally.\n\n- Option (B) \"You mean you're not into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?\" is more straightforward and doesn't carry the same ironic or mocking tone.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
