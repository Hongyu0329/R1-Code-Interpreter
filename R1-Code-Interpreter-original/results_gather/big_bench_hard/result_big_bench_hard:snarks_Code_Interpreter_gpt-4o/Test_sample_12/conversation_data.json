    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, the sarcastic statement would be the one that presents an unlikely or absurd scenario as if it were true.\n\nAnarchism is generally not considered a governing system in the traditional sense, as it advocates for the absence of government. Therefore, saying that anarchism is taught as a prime example of a governing system is likely sarcastic.\n\nOn the other hand, democracy is widely recognized and taught as a prime example of a governing system, so the statement about democracy is not sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Yeah, anarchism is taught as a prime example of a governing system"
