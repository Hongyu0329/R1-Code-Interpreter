    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In the context of these statements, both are discussing a situation in a sport (likely soccer) where a player might be penalized with a red card. \n\nStatement (A) \"But his eyes were on the ball, shouldn't be a red\" is likely sarcastic because it is physically impossible for someone's eyes to be on the ball in the literal sense, and it mocks the idea that the player's intention (watching the ball) should excuse a foul.\n\nStatement (B) \"But his cleats were on the ball, shouldn't be a red\" is more literal and could be a genuine argument that the player made contact with the ball, which might be a reason to argue against a red card.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) But his eyes were on the ball, shouldn't be a red"
