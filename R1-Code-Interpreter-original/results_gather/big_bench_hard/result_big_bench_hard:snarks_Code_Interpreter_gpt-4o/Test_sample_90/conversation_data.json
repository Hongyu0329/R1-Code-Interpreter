    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic tone. In this case, the statement that is sarcastic is likely the one that implies an exaggerated or opposite outcome to what is expected.\n\nOption (A) \"Yeah, I'm sure you'd be so much happier if we never did anything for anyone ever\" is sarcastic because it suggests that not helping others would lead to happiness, which is generally not the expected outcome. The use of \"Yeah, I'm sure\" adds to the sarcastic tone, implying disbelief or irony.\n\nOption (B) \"Yeah, I'm sure you'd be so much lonelier if we never did anything for anyone ever\" is less likely to be sarcastic because it aligns more closely with the expected outcome that not engaging with others could lead to loneliness.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
