    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically for humorous or emphatic effect. In this context, working at a McDonald's, which is known for fast food rather than gourmet cooking, is less likely to make someone an \"amazing chef\" compared to working at a general restaurant, which might offer a broader range of cooking experiences. Therefore, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is:\n\n<<<(B) Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef>>>"
