    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this context, the statement that is sarcastic would likely be the one that presents a scientifically accurate statement in a way that suggests it is absurd or ridiculous.\n\nOption (A) \"SCIENCE CAUSES VACCINES!\" is a straightforward statement that aligns with scientific understanding, as vaccines are indeed a product of scientific research and development.\n\nOption (B) \"EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!\" is less straightforward. While evolution is a fundamental concept in biology, it is not directly responsible for the creation of vaccines. This statement could be interpreted as sarcastic because it attributes the creation of vaccines to evolution in a way that might mock or trivialize the scientific process.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is likely:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!"
