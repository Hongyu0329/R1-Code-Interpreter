    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, both statements are sarcastic, but one is more clearly sarcastic due to the context it implies.\n\nStatement (A) implies that just because something hasn't happened before, it must not be in the lawbooks, which is sarcastic because the speaker likely means the opposite: that it could still be in the lawbooks even if it hasn't happened before.\n\nStatement (B) implies that just because something hasn't happened before, it must not be against the lawbooks, which is also sarcastic because the speaker likely means the opposite: that it could still be against the lawbooks even if it hasn't happened before.\n\nBoth statements are sarcastic, but (A) is more clearly sarcastic because it implies a more direct contradiction to the idea that something must be in the lawbooks to be valid or recognized.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A)"
