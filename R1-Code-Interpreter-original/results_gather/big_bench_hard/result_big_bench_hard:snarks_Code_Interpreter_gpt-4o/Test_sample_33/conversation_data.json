    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, statement (A) is sarcastic because it pretends to praise people for mocking others, which is generally considered negative behavior. The use of \"It's so classy\" in this context is ironic, as mocking is not typically associated with classiness.\n\nStatement (B), on the other hand, is straightforward and genuine, as encouraging others to get healthier is generally seen as positive behavior.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
