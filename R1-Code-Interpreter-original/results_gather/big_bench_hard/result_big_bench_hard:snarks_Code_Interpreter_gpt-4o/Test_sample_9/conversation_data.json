    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is meant, usually in a humorous or mocking way. In the given options:\n\n(A) \"He's over six feet, so he must be tall\" is a straightforward statement that logically follows from the premise.\n\n(B) \"He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful\" is sarcastic because being over six feet tall does not logically imply that someone is wonderful. The statement humorously exaggerates the significance of height.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful"
