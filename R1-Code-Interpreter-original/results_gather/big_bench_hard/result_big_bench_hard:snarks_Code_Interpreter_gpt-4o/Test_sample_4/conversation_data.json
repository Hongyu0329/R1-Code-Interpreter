    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In the given options:\n\n(A) \"He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different\" - This statement could be sarcastic because urging and threatening can be seen as similar in some contexts, and the phrase \"totally different\" might be used sarcastically to imply that they are not actually different.\n\n(B) \"He didn't threaten, he only pleaded; totally different\" - Pleading is generally quite different from threatening, so this statement is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different"
