    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, the statement that is sarcastic is the one that contrasts the idea of being \"dedicated\" with \"lackluster play\" and \"grabbing hot dogs at half time,\" which are not behaviors associated with dedication.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n(B) Yeah, he's clearly dedicated to earning minutes based on his lackluster play and the fact that he's grabbing hot dogs at half time..\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
