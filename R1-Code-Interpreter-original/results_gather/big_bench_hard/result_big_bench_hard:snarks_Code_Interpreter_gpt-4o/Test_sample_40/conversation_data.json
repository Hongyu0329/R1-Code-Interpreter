    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a humorous or mocking way. In this case, the statement that is sarcastic would imply that something is obviously not true or is exaggerated for effect.\n\nOption (A) suggests that protein supplements are more expensive than a very cheap and basic food item, \"breakfast gruel,\" which is likely to be true and not sarcastic.\n\nOption (B) suggests that protein supplements are more expensive than \"breakfast burritos,\" which are generally more substantial and could be more expensive than gruel. This statement could be sarcastic if the implication is that breakfast burritos are not actually cheap, thus making the comparison humorous or exaggerated.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is likely:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Protein supplements are way more expensive than $1 breakfast burritos"
