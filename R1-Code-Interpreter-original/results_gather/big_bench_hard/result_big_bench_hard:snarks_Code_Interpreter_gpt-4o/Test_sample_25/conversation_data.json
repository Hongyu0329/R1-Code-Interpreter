    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is true or expected, usually in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, the statement that is sarcastic would imply that things are indeed more expensive now than they were in the past.\n\nOption (A) \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago\" is likely sarcastic because it is common for prices to increase over a span of several years due to inflation and other economic factors. The statement implies that prices have not increased, which is contrary to the usual expectation.\n\nOption (B) \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago\" is less likely to be sarcastic because prices typically do not change significantly over such a short period of time.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
