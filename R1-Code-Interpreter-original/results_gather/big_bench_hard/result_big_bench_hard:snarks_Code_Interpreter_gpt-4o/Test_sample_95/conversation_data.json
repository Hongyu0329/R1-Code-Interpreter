    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, statement (A) is sarcastic because it blames the laptop manufacturer for a situation that is clearly the user's fault, as laptops are not designed to work underwater. Statement (B) is straightforward and not sarcastic, as it correctly attributes the fault to the user.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) My laptop didn't work when I brought it underwater, therefore it must be Asus's fault that it broke down <<<answer>>>"
