    "\nassistant > Both statements are identical, so they both have the same potential to be sarcastic. Sarcasm is often identified by context, tone, or additional cues that are not present in the text alone. However, the statement \"It's easy to get into politics, all you have to do is be outrageous\" can be interpreted as sarcastic because it implies that being outrageous is a trivial or simplistic way to enter a complex field like politics, which is not typically considered easy.\n\nTherefore, the statement can be seen as sarcastic. Since both options are the same, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
