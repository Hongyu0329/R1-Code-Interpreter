    "\nassistant > Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. In this case, the statement \"Only rich people can afford healthy food\" could be sarcastic if the speaker is implying that it's not true and that healthy food should be accessible to everyone, not just the rich. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"Not only rich people can afford healthy food\" is a straightforward statement that suggests healthy food is accessible to more than just rich people, and it doesn't carry an inherent sarcastic tone.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Only rich people can afford healthy food"
