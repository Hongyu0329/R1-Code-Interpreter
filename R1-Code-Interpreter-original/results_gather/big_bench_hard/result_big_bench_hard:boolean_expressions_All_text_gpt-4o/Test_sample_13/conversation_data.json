    "To analyze the expression \"True and True and False and not True,\" we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. The logical operators in this expression are \"and\" and \"not.\" Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression consists of four boolean values and operators: `True`, `True`, `False`, and `not True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate 'not' operator**:\n   - The 'not' operator negates the boolean value it precedes. In this case, `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated 'not'**:\n   - Replace `not True` with `False` in the expression. The expression now becomes: `True and True and False and False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate 'and' operators**:\n   - The 'and' operator returns `True` only if all operands are `True`. If any operand is `False`, the result is `False`.\n   - Start evaluating from left to right:\n     - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n     - `True and False` evaluates to `False` (since one operand is `False`).\n     - `False and False` evaluates to `False` (since both operands are `False`).\n\n5. **Final result**:\n   - The entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \"True and True and False and not True\" is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
