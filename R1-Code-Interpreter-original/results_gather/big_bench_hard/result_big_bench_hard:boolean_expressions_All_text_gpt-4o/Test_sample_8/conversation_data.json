    "To analyze the given logical expression step by step, we need to understand the logical operators involved and their precedence. The expression is:\n\n`not True or ( False and True )`\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Precedence:**\n   - The operators involved are `not`, `or`, and `and`.\n   - The precedence order is: `not` > `and` > `or`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Expression Inside Parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `( False and True )`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Here, `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `not` Operator:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the truth value of its operand.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Combine the Results Using the `or` Operator:**\n   - Now the expression simplifies to: `False or False`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Here, both operands are `False`, so `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter evaluating the expression step by step, the final result is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
