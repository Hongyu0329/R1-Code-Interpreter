    "To analyze the expression `(True) and True or not True`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the precedence and associativity of logical operators in Python.\n\n1. **Identify the operators and their precedence:**\n   - The expression contains the operators `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n   - The precedence order is: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression step by step:**\n   - **Step 1:** Evaluate `not True`.\n     - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n   - **Step 2:** Evaluate `(True) and True`.\n     - Since both operands are `True`, the result of `True and True` is `True`.\n   - **Step 3:** Evaluate the result of `True and True` with the result of `not True` using the `or` operator.\n     - The expression now is `True or False`.\n     - Since `or` returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`, the result of `True or False` is `True`.\n\n3. **Final result:**\n   - The entire expression `(True) and True or not True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
