    "To analyze the expression `not not not (False and True)`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operations involved:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**: \n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. In this case, one operand is `False` and the other is `True`.\n   - Therefore, `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Apply the first `not` operator**:\n   - We now have `not (False)`.\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Apply the second `not` operator**:\n   - We now have `not (True)`.\n   - Again, the `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Apply the third `not` operator**:\n   - We now have `not (False)`.\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nAfter evaluating all the steps, the final result of the expression `not not not (False and True)` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
