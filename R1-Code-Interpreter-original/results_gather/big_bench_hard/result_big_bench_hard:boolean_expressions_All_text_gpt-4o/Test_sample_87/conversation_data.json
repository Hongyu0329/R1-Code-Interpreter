    "To analyze the expression `False and not (False or False)`, we need to break it down step by step, evaluating each part of the expression according to the rules of logical operations.\n\n1. **Identify the innermost expression**: \n   - The innermost expression is `(False or False)`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result of `False or False` is `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` operator**:\n   - The expression now becomes `False and not (False)`.\n   - The `not` operator negates the value of the operand. Since the operand is `False`, `not (False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `and` operator**:\n   - The expression now is `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since the first operand is `False`, the result of `False and True` is `False`.\n\nBy following these steps, we have evaluated the entire expression.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<False>>>."
