    "To analyze the expression `False or ( False ) and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to the order of operations in arithmetic (PEMDAS/BODMAS). The order of operations for logical expressions is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate any expressions within parentheses first. In this case, the expression within the parentheses is `False`, which remains `False`.\n\n   Expression after evaluating parentheses: `False or False and not False`\n\n2. **NOT**: Evaluate the NOT operation next. The NOT operation negates the truth value of the expression it precedes. Here, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n   Expression after evaluating NOT: `False or False and True`\n\n3. **AND**: Evaluate the AND operation next. The AND operation returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Here, we have `False and True`, which evaluates to `False`.\n\n   Expression after evaluating AND: `False or False`\n\n4. **OR**: Finally, evaluate the OR operation. The OR operation returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Here, we have `False or False`, which evaluates to `False`.\n\nThe final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
