    "To analyze the expression `(True) and True and not True`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The expression `(True)` is simply `True`. Parentheses are used for grouping, but in this case, they don't change the value.\n\n2. **Logical AND (`and`)**: The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n3. **Logical NOT (`not`)**: The `not` operator negates the value of the operand. If the operand is `True`, `not` makes it `False`, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n- Start with the expression: `(True) and True and not True`.\n\n- Evaluate `not True`:\n  - `not True` is `False`.\n\n- Substitute back into the expression:\n  - The expression now becomes `True and True and False`.\n\n- Evaluate `True and True`:\n  - `True and True` is `True`.\n\n- Substitute back into the expression:\n  - The expression now becomes `True and False`.\n\n- Evaluate `True and False`:\n  - `True and False` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(True) and True and not True` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
