    "To analyze the expression `( not False and ( True ) )`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression contains the logical operators `not` and `and`.\n   - The components involved are `False` and `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not False`**:\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True` because negating `False` results in `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses `( True )`**:\n   - The parentheses simply contain the boolean value `True`.\n   - Therefore, `( True )` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Combine the results using `and`**:\n   - Now we have `True and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n   - Since both operands are `True`, `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n5. **Final evaluation**:\n   - The entire expression `( not False and ( True ) )` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
