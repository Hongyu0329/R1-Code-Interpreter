    "To analyze the expression `not not True and not True or True`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the precedence of logical operators in Python. The precedence order is: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not not True`:**\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - So, `not not True` simplifies to `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not True`:**\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **Combine with `and`:**\n   - Now we have `True and False`.\n   - `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Combine with `or`:**\n   - Now we have `False or True`.\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not not True and not True or True` is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
