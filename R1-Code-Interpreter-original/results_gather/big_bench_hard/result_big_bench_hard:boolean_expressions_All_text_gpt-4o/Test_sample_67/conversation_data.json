    "To analyze the logical expression \"True and not False or False and False,\" we need to break it down step by step, considering the precedence of logical operators. The precedence order for logical operators is: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression consists of `True`, `not False`, `False`, and `False`.\n   - The logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not` operator**:\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated `not`**:\n   - The expression now becomes: `True and True or False and False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `and` operators** (since `and` has higher precedence than `or`):\n   - Evaluate `True and True`: This evaluates to `True`.\n   - Evaluate `False and False`: This evaluates to `False`.\n\n5. **Substitute the evaluated `and` expressions**:\n   - The expression now becomes: `True or False`.\n\n6. **Evaluate `or` operator**:\n   - `True or False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression \"True and not False or False and False\" is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
