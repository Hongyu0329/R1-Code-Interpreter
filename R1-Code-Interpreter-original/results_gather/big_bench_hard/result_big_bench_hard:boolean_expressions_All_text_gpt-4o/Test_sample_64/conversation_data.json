    "To analyze the expression `not ( True or True or False )`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operations involved.\n\n1. **Understand the Logical Operators:**\n   - `or`: This operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - `not`: This operator negates the truth value of the operand. If the operand is `True`, it returns `False`, and if the operand is `False`, it returns `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Expression Inside the Parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `True or True or False`.\n   - According to the `or` operator, we need to check if at least one of the values is `True`.\n   - The first value is `True`, so the entire expression `True or True or False` evaluates to `True` because `or` only requires one `True` to return `True`.\n\n3. **Apply the `not` Operator:**\n   - Now, we have `not (True)`.\n   - The `not` operator negates the truth value of `True`, resulting in `False`.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The entire expression `not ( True or True or False )` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
