    "To analyze the expression `( not False ) and False or True`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the precedence and associativity of logical operators in Python. The logical operators involved are `not`, `and`, and `or`.\n\n1. **Operator Precedence**: \n   - `not` has the highest precedence among the logical operators.\n   - `and` has the next highest precedence.\n   - `or` has the lowest precedence.\n\n2. **Expression Breakdown**:\n   - The expression is `( not False ) and False or True`.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Evaluation**:\n   - **Step 1**: Evaluate `not False`.\n     - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n     - The expression now becomes `True and False or True`.\n\n   - **Step 2**: Evaluate `True and False`.\n     - According to operator precedence, `and` is evaluated before `or`.\n     - `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n     - The expression now becomes `False or True`.\n\n   - **Step 3**: Evaluate `False or True`.\n     - `or` is the last operator to be evaluated.\n     - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Final Result**:\n   - The entire expression `( not False ) and False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
