    "To analyze the expression `not ( False ) or not not True`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operations involved.\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression consists of logical operations: `not` and `or`.\n   - The components are: `not ( False )`, `or`, and `not not True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not ( False )`**:\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - `False` is negated by `not`, resulting in `True`.\n   - So, `not ( False )` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `not not True`**:\n   - The `not` operator is applied twice.\n   - The first `not` negates `True`, resulting in `False`.\n   - The second `not` negates `False`, resulting in `True`.\n   - So, `not not True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Combine the results using `or`**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - We have `True or True`.\n   - Since at least one operand is `True`, the result of the `or` operation is `True`.\n\n5. **Final result**:\n   - The entire expression `not ( False ) or not not True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
