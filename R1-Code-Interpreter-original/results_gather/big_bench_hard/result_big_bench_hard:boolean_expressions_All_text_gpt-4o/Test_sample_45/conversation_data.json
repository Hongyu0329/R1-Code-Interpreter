    "To analyze the expression `( not False and False and False )`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Operands:**\n   - The expression contains the logical operators `not` and `and`.\n   - The operands are `False`, `False`, and `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` Operator:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it precedes.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the Result:**\n   - After evaluating `not False`, the expression becomes `( True and False and False )`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `and` Operator:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if and only if all operands are `True`.\n   - In the expression `True and False`, since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n   - Now the expression is reduced to `False and False`.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - Evaluate `False and False`.\n   - Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `( not False and False and False )` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
