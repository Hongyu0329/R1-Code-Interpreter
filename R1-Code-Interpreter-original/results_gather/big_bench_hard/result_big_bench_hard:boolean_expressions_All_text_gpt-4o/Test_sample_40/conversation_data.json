    "To analyze the expression `(False and True or not False)`, we need to break it down step by step, following the rules of logical operations and operator precedence in Python.\n\n1. **Operator Precedence**: In Python, the `not` operator has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`. This means we need to evaluate `not` first, then `and`, and finally `or`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not False`**: \n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to. \n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated part back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes `(False and True or True)`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `False and True`**:\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n5. **Substitute the evaluated part back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes `(False or True)`.\n\n6. **Evaluate `False or True`**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. It returns `False` only if both operands are `False`.\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(False and True or not False)` is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
