    "To analyze the logical expression `False and False or not (True)`, we need to break it down step by step, following the rules of logical operations and operator precedence.\n\n1. **Identify the operators and their precedence:**\n   - The operators involved are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n   - The precedence order is: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `True`.\n   - Since there are no operators inside the parentheses, the value remains `True`.\n\n3. **Apply the `not` operator:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the value of the expression it is applied to.\n   - `not (True)` becomes `False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `and` operation:**\n   - The expression now is `False and False or False`.\n   - According to precedence, evaluate `and` before `or`.\n   - `False and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n5. **Evaluate the `or` operation:**\n   - Now the expression is `False or False`.\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n6. **Final result:**\n   - The entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression `False and False or not (True)` is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
