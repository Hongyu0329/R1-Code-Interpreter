    "To analyze the given logical expression step by step, we need to understand the precedence and associativity of the logical operators involved. The expression is:\n\n`not False or (True) and True`\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Their Precedence:**\n   - `not` has the highest precedence.\n   - `and` has the next highest precedence.\n   - `or` has the lowest precedence.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Expression Inside Parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is simply `True`, so it evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Apply the `not` Operator:**\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `and` Operator:**\n   - Now, the expression becomes `True or True and True`.\n   - According to precedence, evaluate `True and True` first.\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n5. **Evaluate the `or` Operator:**\n   - Now, the expression is `True or True`.\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
