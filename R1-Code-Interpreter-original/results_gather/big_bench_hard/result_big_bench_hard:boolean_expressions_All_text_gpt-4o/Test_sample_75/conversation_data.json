    "To analyze the expression `not ( False ) and ( False )`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operators involved:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Operands:**\n   - The expression contains the logical operators `not` and `and`.\n   - The operands are `False` and `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` Operator:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - In this expression, `not ( False )` is evaluated first.\n   - `not ( False )` becomes `True` because the negation of `False` is `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `and` Operator:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - After evaluating `not ( False )`, the expression becomes `True and ( False )`.\n   - Now, evaluate `True and ( False )`.\n   - Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `True and ( False )` is `False`.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The entire expression `not ( False ) and ( False )` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
