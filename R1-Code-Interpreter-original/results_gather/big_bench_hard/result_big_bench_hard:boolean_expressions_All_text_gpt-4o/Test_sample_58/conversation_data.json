    "To analyze the logical expression \"True and not False and not not True,\" we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. The operators we are dealing with are \"and\" and \"not.\"\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression consists of three main parts: \"True,\" \"not False,\" and \"not not True.\"\n\n2. **Evaluate 'not' operators**:\n   - \"not False\": The \"not\" operator negates the value of \"False,\" turning it into \"True.\"\n   - \"not not True\": The first \"not\" negates \"True\" to \"False,\" and the second \"not\" negates \"False\" back to \"True.\"\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated components back into the expression**:\n   - After evaluating the \"not\" operators, the expression becomes \"True and True and True.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate 'and' operators**:\n   - \"True and True\": The \"and\" operator returns \"True\" if both operands are \"True.\" Therefore, \"True and True\" evaluates to \"True.\"\n   - \"True and True\": Again, the \"and\" operator returns \"True\" if both operands are \"True.\" Therefore, \"True and True\" evaluates to \"True.\"\n\n5. **Final evaluation**:\n   - The entire expression \"True and not False and not not True\" simplifies to \"True.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
