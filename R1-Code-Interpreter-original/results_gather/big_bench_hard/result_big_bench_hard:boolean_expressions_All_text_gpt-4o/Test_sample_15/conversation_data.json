    "To analyze the expression `not not not (True and False)`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operations involved.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `True and False`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one operand is `False`, the result of `True and False` is `False`.\n\n2. **Apply the first `not` operator**:\n   - The expression now becomes `not (False)`.\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value. Therefore, `not False` is `True`.\n\n3. **Apply the second `not` operator**:\n   - The expression now becomes `not (True)`.\n   - Again, the `not` operator negates the boolean value. Therefore, `not True` is `False`.\n\n4. **Apply the third `not` operator**:\n   - The expression now becomes `not (False)`.\n   - Once more, the `not` operator negates the boolean value. Therefore, `not False` is `True`.\n\nAfter evaluating the expression step by step, the final result is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
