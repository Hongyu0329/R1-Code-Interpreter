    "To analyze the logical expression \"True and True and True or not False,\" we need to evaluate it step by step, following the rules of logical operations and operator precedence. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Operands:**\n   - The expression consists of the logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n   - The operands are the boolean values `True` and `False`.\n\n2. **Operator Precedence:**\n   - The `not` operator has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n   - This means we need to evaluate `not` first, then `and`, and finally `or`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `not False`:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Substitute the Result:**\n   - Replace `not False` with `True` in the original expression.\n   - The expression now becomes: `True and True and True or True`.\n\n5. **Evaluate `and` Operations:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - Evaluate `True and True`: This results in `True`.\n   - Now, evaluate `True and True` again (since the expression is `True and True and True`): This also results in `True`.\n\n6. **Substitute the Result:**\n   - The expression now simplifies to: `True or True`.\n\n7. **Evaluate `or` Operation:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n8. **Final Result:**\n   - The entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \"True and True and True or not False\" is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
