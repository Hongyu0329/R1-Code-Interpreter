    "To analyze the expression `not not (False or not True)`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operations involved:\n\n1. **Innermost Expression**: Start with the innermost part of the expression, which is `not True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Next Level**: Substitute the result of `not True` into the expression `False or not True`.\n   - This becomes `False or False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the OR Operation**: Evaluate the `or` operation.\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **First NOT Operation**: Apply the first `not` to the result of the `or` operation.\n   - `not (False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\n5. **Second NOT Operation**: Apply the second `not` to the result of the first `not`.\n   - `not (True)` evaluates to `False`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `not not (False or not True)` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
