    "To analyze the expression `( not True ) and True and False`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. The logical operators in this expression are `not`, `and`, and `and`. Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not True`:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False and True and False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `False and True`:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False and False`.\n\n5. **Evaluate `False and False`:**\n   - Again, using the `and` operator, `False and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\nThe final result of the expression `( not True ) and True and False` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
