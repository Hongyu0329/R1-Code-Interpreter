    "To analyze the given logical expression step by step, we need to understand the logical operators involved:\n\n1. **True**: This is a boolean value representing truth.\n\n2. **not**: This is a logical negation operator. It inverts the truth value of the operand. If the operand is `True`, `not` makes it `False`, and vice versa.\n\n3. **or**: This is a logical disjunction operator. The result of `A or B` is `True` if at least one of `A` or `B` is `True`. If both are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nNow, let's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost expression**: The innermost expression is `( not True )`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not True`**: The `not` operator negates `True`, resulting in `False`.\n\n3. **Substitute back into the expression**: After evaluating `not True`, substitute the result back into the original expression. The expression now becomes `True or False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `True or False`**: The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since the first operand is `True`, the result of `True or False` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `True or ( ( not True ) )` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
