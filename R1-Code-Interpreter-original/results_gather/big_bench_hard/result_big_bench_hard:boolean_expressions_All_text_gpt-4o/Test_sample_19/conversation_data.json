    "To analyze the expression `False or ( False and not False )`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operators and their precedence:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Precedence:**\n   - The expression contains the logical operators `or`, `and`, and `not`.\n   - The precedence of these operators is as follows: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Expression Inside the Parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `False and not False`.\n   - According to operator precedence, evaluate `not False` first:\n     - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - Now the expression inside the parentheses becomes `False and True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `and` Operation:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - In this case, `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `or` Operation:**\n   - Now the expression is `False or False`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - Here, both operands are `False`, so `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The entire expression `False or ( False and not False )` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
