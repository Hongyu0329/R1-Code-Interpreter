    "To analyze the expression `not False and False and False or False`, we need to understand the order of operations and how logical operators work in Python. The logical operators in Python follow a specific precedence order: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operators and their precedence:**\n   - `not` has the highest precedence.\n   - `and` has the next highest precedence.\n   - `or` has the lowest precedence.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` operator:**\n   - The expression starts with `not False`. The `not` operator negates the boolean value.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated part back into the expression:**\n   - After evaluating `not False`, the expression becomes `True and False and False or False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `and` operators:**\n   - The `and` operator requires both operands to be `True` for the result to be `True`. Otherwise, it results in `False`.\n   - Evaluate `True and False`: This results in `False` because one of the operands is `False`.\n   - Substitute back: The expression now is `False and False or False`.\n   - Evaluate `False and False`: This results in `False` because both operands are `False`.\n   - Substitute back: The expression now is `False or False`.\n\n5. **Evaluate the `or` operator:**\n   - The `or` operator requires at least one operand to be `True` for the result to be `True`. If both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n   - Evaluate `False or False`: This results in `False` because both operands are `False`.\n\nAfter evaluating all parts of the expression, the final result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression `not False and False and False or False` is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
