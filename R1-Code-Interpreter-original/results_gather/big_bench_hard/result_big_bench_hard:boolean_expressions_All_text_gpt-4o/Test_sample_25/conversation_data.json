    "To analyze the expression `(False or not False or False)`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. The expression consists of the logical operators `or` and `not`.\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression is composed of three boolean values: `False`, `not False`, and `False`.\n   - The operators used are `or` and `not`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not False`**:\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated value back into the expression**:\n   - After evaluating `not False`, the expression becomes `(False or True or False)`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `or` operations**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Evaluate from left to right:\n     - `False or True` evaluates to `True` because one of the operands is `True`.\n     - Now, the expression is `True or False`.\n     - `True or False` evaluates to `True` because one of the operands is `True`.\n\n5. **Final result**:\n   - The entire expression `(False or not False or False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
