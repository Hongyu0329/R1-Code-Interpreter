    "To analyze the expression `False or ( not False ) and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have `not False`.\n\n2. **NOT**: The `not` operator negates the value of the expression it precedes.\n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated expression back**: Replace the evaluated part back into the original expression.\n   - The expression now becomes `False or True and True`.\n\n4. **AND**: Evaluate the `and` operator next, as it has higher precedence than `or`.\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n5. **Substitute the evaluated expression back**: Replace the evaluated part back into the expression.\n   - The expression now becomes `False or True`.\n\n6. **OR**: Finally, evaluate the `or` operator.\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `False or ( not False ) and True` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
