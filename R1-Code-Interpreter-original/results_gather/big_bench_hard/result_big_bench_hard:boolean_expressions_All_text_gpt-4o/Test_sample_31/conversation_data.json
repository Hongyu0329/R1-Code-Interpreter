    "To analyze the expression `not not not not ( not False )`, we need to understand how the `not` operator works in Python. The `not` operator is a logical negation operator that inverts the truth value of the operand it is applied to. Let's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost Expression:**\n   - Start with the innermost part of the expression: `( not False )`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True` because the negation of `False` is `True`.\n\n2. **Next Level:**\n   - Now we have `not not not not True`.\n   - Apply the first `not` to `True`: `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **Next Level:**\n   - Now we have `not not not False`.\n   - Apply the next `not` to `False`: `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Next Level:**\n   - Now we have `not not True`.\n   - Apply the next `not` to `True`: `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n5. **Final Level:**\n   - Now we have `not False`.\n   - Apply the final `not` to `False`: `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nAfter evaluating the expression step by step, the final result is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
