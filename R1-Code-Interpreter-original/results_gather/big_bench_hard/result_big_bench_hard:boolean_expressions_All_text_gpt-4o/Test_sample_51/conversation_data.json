    "To analyze the expression `not not False or False and not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not not False`:**\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n   - So, `not not False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not True`:**\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `False and not True`:**\n   - We already know `not True` is `False`.\n   - `False and False` is `False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `not not False or False and not True`:**\n   - We have `not not False` which is `False`.\n   - We have `False and not True` which is `False`.\n   - Now, evaluate `False or False`.\n   - `False or False` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not not False or False and not True` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
