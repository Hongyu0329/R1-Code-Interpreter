    "To analyze the expression `True and (False) or not False`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the precedence of logical operators in Python, which follows this order: `not`, `and`, `or`.\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - `True`\n   - `False`\n   - `not False`\n\n2. **Evaluate `not False`**:\n   - The `not` operator negates the value of `False`, turning it into `True`.\n   - So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated part back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes `True and (False) or True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `True and (False)`**:\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Here, one operand is `True` and the other is `False`.\n   - Therefore, `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n5. **Substitute the evaluated part back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes `False or True`.\n\n6. **Evaluate `False or True`**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Here, one operand is `False` and the other is `True`.\n   - Therefore, `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `True and (False) or not False` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
