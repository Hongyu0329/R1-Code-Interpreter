    "To analyze the given logical expression step by step, we need to break it down into its components and evaluate each part according to the rules of logic.\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression is `not ( True ) and ( True )`.\n   - It consists of two main parts: `not ( True )` and `( True )`.\n   - These two parts are connected by the logical operator `and`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not ( True )`**:\n   - The `not` operator negates the truth value of the expression it is applied to.\n   - Since the expression inside the parentheses is `True`, applying `not` to it will negate it.\n   - Therefore, `not ( True )` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `( True )`**:\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is simply `True`.\n   - Therefore, `( True )` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Combine the results using `and`**:\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`.\n   - In this case, we have `False` (from `not ( True )`) and `True` (from `( True )`).\n   - Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `False and True` is `False`.\n\n5. **Final result**:\n   - The entire expression `not ( True ) and ( True )` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
