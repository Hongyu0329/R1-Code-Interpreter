    "To analyze the expression `not not ( not False or True )`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operations involved. Let's go through each part carefully:\n\n1. **Innermost Expression: `not False`**\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Next Expression: `not False or True`**\n   - We substitute the result from step 1: `True or True`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Next Expression: `not (not False or True)`**\n   - We substitute the result from step 2: `not True`.\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Final Expression: `not not (not False or True)`**\n   - We substitute the result from step 3: `not False`.\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not not ( not False or True )` is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
