    "To analyze the expression `(True) and False or not False`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the precedence of logical operators in Python. The precedence order for logical operators is `not`, `and`, then `or`.\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - `True`\n   - `False`\n   - `not False`\n\n2. **Evaluate `not False`**:\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value.\n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated expression back**:\n   - The expression now becomes `True and False or True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `True and False`**:\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.\n   - `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n5. **Substitute the evaluated expression back**:\n   - The expression now becomes `False or True`.\n\n6. **Evaluate `False or True`**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(True) and False or not False` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
