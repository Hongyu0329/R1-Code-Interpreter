    "To analyze the expression `False and False or True and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operators and operands:**\n   - The expression is: `False and False or True and not False`\n   - Operators present: `and`, `or`, `not`\n   - Operands present: `False`, `True`\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` operator:**\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n   After this step, the expression becomes: `False and False or True and True`\n\n3. **Evaluate the `and` operators:**\n   - `False and False` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n   After this step, the expression becomes: `False or True`\n\n4. **Evaluate the `or` operator:**\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `False and False or True and not False` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
