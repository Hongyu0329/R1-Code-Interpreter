    "To analyze the expression `not True and True and True or False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not True`:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the value of `True`, so `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False and True and True or False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `False and True`:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False and True or False`.\n\n5. **Evaluate `False and True`:**\n   - Again, the `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n6. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False or False`.\n\n7. **Evaluate `False or False`:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not True and True and True or False` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
