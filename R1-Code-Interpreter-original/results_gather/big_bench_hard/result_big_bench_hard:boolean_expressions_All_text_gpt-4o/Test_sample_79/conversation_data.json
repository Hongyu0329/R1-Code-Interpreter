    "To analyze the expression `(not not True and not False)`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operations involved:\n\n1. **Understand the `not` operator**: \n   - The `not` operator is a logical negation. It inverts the truth value of the operand.\n   - `not True` becomes `False`.\n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **Break down the expression**:\n   - The expression is `(not not True and not False)`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `not not True`**:\n   - First, evaluate the innermost `not`: `not True` is `False`.\n   - Then, apply `not` again: `not False` is `True`.\n   - So, `not not True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `not False`**:\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n5. **Combine the results with `and`**:\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n   - We have `True and True` from the evaluations above.\n\n6. **Final evaluation**:\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(not not True and not False)` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
