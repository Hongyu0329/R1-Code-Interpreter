    "To analyze the expression `not not ( True ) and not False`, we need to break it down step by step, evaluating each part carefully:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - The innermost expression is `True`. \n   - `not not (True)` is equivalent to `not (not True)`. \n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `not False` evaluates back to `True`.\n   - Therefore, `not not (True)` simplifies to `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part of the expression**:\n   - The expression `not False` is straightforward.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Combine the results with the `and` operator**:\n   - We now have `True and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n   - Since both operands are `True`, the result of `True and True` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression `not not ( True ) and not False` is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
