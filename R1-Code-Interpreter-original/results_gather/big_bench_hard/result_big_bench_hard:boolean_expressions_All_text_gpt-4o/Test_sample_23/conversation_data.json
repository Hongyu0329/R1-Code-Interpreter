    "To analyze the expression `not ( True ) or False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. The logical operators in Python follow a specific order of precedence: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not (True)`**:\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - `not (True)` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes `False or False or True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `False or False or True`**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Evaluate from left to right:\n     - `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n     - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not ( True ) or False or True` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
