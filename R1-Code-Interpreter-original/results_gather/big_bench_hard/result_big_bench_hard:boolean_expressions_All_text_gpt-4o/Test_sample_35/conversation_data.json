    "To analyze the expression `not True or not False and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the `not` operations**: \n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - The second `not False` also evaluates to `True`.\n\n   After applying the `not` operations, the expression becomes:\n   - `False or True and True`\n\n2. **Evaluate the `and` operation**:\n   - According to the precedence rules, `and` is evaluated before `or`.\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n   Now the expression is simplified to:\n   - `False or True`\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operation**:\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not True or not False and not False` is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
