    "To analyze the given logical expression step by step, we need to understand the logical operators involved:\n\n1. **True**: This is a boolean value representing truth.\n2. **False**: This is a boolean value representing falsehood.\n3. **not**: This is a logical negation operator. It inverts the truth value of the operand.\n4. **and**: This is a logical conjunction operator. The result is True if both operands are True; otherwise, it is False.\n\nNow, let's break down the expression `(True and not True and False)` step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not True`:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the truth value of `True`.\n   - `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `(True and False and False)`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `True and False`:**\n   - The `and` operator requires both operands to be True for the result to be True.\n   - Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `True and False` is `False`.\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `(False and False)`.\n\n5. **Evaluate `False and False`:**\n   - Again, the `and` operator requires both operands to be True for the result to be True.\n   - Since both operands are `False`, the result of `False and False` is `False`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `(True and not True and False)` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
