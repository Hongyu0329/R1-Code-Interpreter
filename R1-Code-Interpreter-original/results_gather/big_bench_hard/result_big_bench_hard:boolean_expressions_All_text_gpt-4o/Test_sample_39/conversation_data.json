    "To analyze the expression `(False) or False and not True`, we need to understand the order of operations in logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic expressions. The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: The expression is `(False) or False and not True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not`**: The `not` operator has the highest precedence, so we evaluate `not True` first.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `and`**: Next, we evaluate the `and` operation. The expression now is `False and False`.\n   - `False and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `or`**: Finally, we evaluate the `or` operation. The expression now is `False or False`.\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(False) or False and not True` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
