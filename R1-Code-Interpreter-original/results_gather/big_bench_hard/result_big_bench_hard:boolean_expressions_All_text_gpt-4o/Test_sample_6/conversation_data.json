    "To analyze the expression `not True and (False or True)`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the order of operations and the logical operators involved.\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Their Precedence:**\n   - The expression contains the logical operators `not`, `and`, and `or`.\n   - The precedence order for these operators is: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Expression Inside the Parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `(False or True)`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since one of the operands is `True`, the result of `(False or True)` is `True`.\n\n3. **Apply the `not` Operator:**\n   - The expression now becomes `not True and True`.\n   - The `not` operator negates the value of the operand.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `and` Operator:**\n   - The expression is now `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`.\n   - Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `False and True` is `False`.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression `not True and (False or True)` is:\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
