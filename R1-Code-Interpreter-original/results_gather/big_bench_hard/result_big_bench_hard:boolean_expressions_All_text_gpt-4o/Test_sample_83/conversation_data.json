    "To analyze the given logical expression step by step, we need to understand the logical operators involved: \"or\" and \"not\". The expression is:\n\nTrue or ( True or not False )\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression first:**\n   - The innermost expression is \"not False\".\n   - The \"not\" operator negates the value of the operand. Since the operand is \"False\", \"not False\" becomes \"True\".\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated expression back into the original expression:**\n   - Replace \"not False\" with \"True\" in the expression: \n   - The expression now becomes: True or ( True or True )\n\n3. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is \"True or True\".\n   - The \"or\" operator returns \"True\" if at least one of the operands is \"True\". Since both operands are \"True\", the result of \"True or True\" is \"True\".\n\n4. **Substitute the evaluated expression back into the original expression:**\n   - Replace \"True or True\" with \"True\" in the expression:\n   - The expression now becomes: True or True\n\n5. **Evaluate the final expression:**\n   - The expression is \"True or True\".\n   - Again, the \"or\" operator returns \"True\" if at least one of the operands is \"True\". Since both operands are \"True\", the result of \"True or True\" is \"True\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression True or ( True or not False ) is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
