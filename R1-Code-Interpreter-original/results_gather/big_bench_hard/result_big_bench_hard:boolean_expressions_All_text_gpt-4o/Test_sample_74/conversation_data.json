    "To analyze the expression `( not False or True ) and True`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operators and their precedence:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Precedence:**\n   - The expression contains `not`, `or`, and `and`.\n   - The precedence order is: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` Operator:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - In the expression, `not False` is evaluated first because `not` has the highest precedence.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` Operator:**\n   - After evaluating `not False` to `True`, the expression becomes `(True or True) and True`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `and` Operator:**\n   - Now, the expression is `True and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`.\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The entire expression `( not False or True ) and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
