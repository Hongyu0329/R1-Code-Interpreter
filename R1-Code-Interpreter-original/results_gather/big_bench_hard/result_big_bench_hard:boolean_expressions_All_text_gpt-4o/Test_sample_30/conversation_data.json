    "To analyze the expression `False and ( not False ) or False`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the precedence of logical operators. The precedence order for logical operators is: `not` has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n\n1. **Evaluate the `not` operator:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `not False`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False and True or False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `and` operator:**\n   - According to precedence, `and` is evaluated before `or`.\n   - Evaluate `False and True`.\n   - `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False or False`.\n\n5. **Evaluate the `or` operator:**\n   - Evaluate `False or False`.\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\nAfter evaluating all parts of the expression step by step, the final result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
