    "To analyze the expression `False or not False and (False)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to the order of operations in arithmetic (PEMDAS/BODMAS). The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. Not\n3. And\n4. Or\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate any expressions within parentheses first. In this case, the expression within the parentheses is `False`, which remains `False`.\n\n2. **Not**: The next step is to evaluate the `not` operator. The expression `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **And**: Now, evaluate the `and` operator. The expression `not False and (False)` becomes `True and False`. The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n4. **Or**: Finally, evaluate the `or` operator. The expression is now `False or False`. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `False or not False and (False)` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
