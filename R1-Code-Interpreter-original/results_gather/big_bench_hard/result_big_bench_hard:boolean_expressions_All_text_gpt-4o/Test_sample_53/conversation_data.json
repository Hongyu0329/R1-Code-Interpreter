    "To analyze the expression `not False and not False and not False`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the `not` operator**: \n   - The `not` operator is a logical negation. It inverts the truth value of the operand.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True` because negating `False` results in `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluating each `not False`**:\n   - The expression has three instances of `not False`.\n   - Each `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Understanding the `and` operator**:\n   - The `and` operator is a logical conjunction. It results in `True` if and only if both operands are `True`.\n   - If any operand is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n4. **Evaluating the entire expression**:\n   - We have `True and True and True` after evaluating each `not False`.\n   - Evaluate `True and True`: This results in `True` because both operands are `True`.\n   - Now, evaluate `True and True` again (the result from the previous step and the remaining `True`): This also results in `True`.\n\n5. **Final result**:\n   - The entire expression `not False and not False and not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
