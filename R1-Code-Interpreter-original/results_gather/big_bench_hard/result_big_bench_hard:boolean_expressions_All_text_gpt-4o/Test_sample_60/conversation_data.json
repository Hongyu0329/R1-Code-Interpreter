    "To analyze the expression `not not (False and not True)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost Expression**: \n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Next Level**:\n   - `False and False`: The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since both operands here are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n3. **Outer Expression**:\n   - `not (False)`: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. Since the operand is `False`, `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Final Expression**:\n   - `not (True)`: Again, the `not` operator negates the boolean value. Since the operand is `True`, `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not not (False and not True)` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
