    "To analyze the logical expression `True and not False or (True)`, we need to evaluate it step by step, following the rules of logical operations and operator precedence. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Operands:**\n   - The expression contains the logical operators `and`, `not`, and `or`.\n   - The operands are the boolean values `True` and `False`.\n\n2. **Operator Precedence:**\n   - The `not` operator has the highest precedence, followed by `and`, and then `or`.\n   - Parentheses `()` can be used to override the default precedence, but in this case, `(True)` is just `True` and doesn't affect precedence.\n\n3. **Evaluate `not False`:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `True and True`:**\n   - Now, substitute `not False` with `True`, the expression becomes `True and True or True`.\n   - The `and` operator is evaluated next.\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n5. **Evaluate `True or True`:**\n   - Substitute `True and True` with `True`, the expression becomes `True or True`.\n   - The `or` operator is evaluated last.\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression `True and not False or (True)` is:\n\n<<<answer>>> True"
