    "To analyze the given logical expression step by step, we need to understand the logical operators involved and how they work:\n\n1. **Logical NOT (`not`)**: This operator negates the truth value of the operand. If the operand is `True`, `not` makes it `False`, and vice versa.\n\n2. **Logical OR (`or`)**: This operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. If both operands are `False`, it returns `False`.\n\nNow, let's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the `not` operator**: \n   - The expression starts with `( not False )`. \n   - `not False` evaluates to `True` because the `not` operator negates the `False` value.\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated value**:\n   - After evaluating `not False`, the expression becomes `( True ) or ( True )`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operator**:\n   - Now, we have `True or True`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `True`, the result is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `( not False ) or ( True )` is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
