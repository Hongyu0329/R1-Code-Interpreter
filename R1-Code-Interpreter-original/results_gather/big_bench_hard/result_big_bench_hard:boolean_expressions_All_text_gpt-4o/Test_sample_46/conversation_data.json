    "To analyze the expression `( ( not True ) or True )`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost expression**: The innermost expression here is `( not True )`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not True`**: \n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value.\n   - `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated expression back**: \n   - Replace `( not True )` with `False` in the original expression.\n   - The expression now becomes `( False or True )`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `False or True`**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - In this case, `False or True` evaluates to `True` because one of the operands is `True`.\n\n5. **Final result**: The entire expression `( ( not True ) or True )` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
