    "To analyze the expression `(False) and not False and True`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. The logical operators in Python are evaluated in the following order of precedence: `not`, `and`, `or`. Let's break down the expression:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression consists of three boolean values: `False`, `False`, and `True`.\n   - It also includes the logical operators `and` and `not`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not` operator**:\n   - The `not` operator has the highest precedence and is applied to the second `False`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated part back into the expression**:\n   - After evaluating `not False`, the expression becomes: `(False) and True and True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `and` operators**:\n   - The `and` operator is evaluated from left to right.\n   - First, evaluate `(False) and True`:\n     - `False and True` evaluates to `False` because `and` requires both operands to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n   - Substitute the result back into the expression: `False and True`.\n\n5. **Evaluate the remaining `and` operator**:\n   - Now, evaluate `False and True`:\n     - Again, `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n6. **Final result**:\n   - The entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression `(False) and not False and True` is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
