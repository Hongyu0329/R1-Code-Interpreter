    "To analyze the expression `True and False or ( not True )`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. Not\n3. And\n4. Or\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `( not True )`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n   So, the expression becomes: `True and False or False`.\n\n2. **Not**: There are no more `not` operators outside the parentheses, so we move to the next step.\n\n3. **And**: Evaluate the `and` operation next.\n   - The expression is now `True and False or False`.\n   - `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n   So, the expression becomes: `False or False`.\n\n4. **Or**: Finally, evaluate the `or` operation.\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `True and False or ( not True )` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
