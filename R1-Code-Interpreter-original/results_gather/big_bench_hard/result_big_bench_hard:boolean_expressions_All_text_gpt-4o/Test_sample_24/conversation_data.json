    "To analyze the expression `(True and not not not True)`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the logical operators involved:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The expression consists of the logical operators `and` and `not`.\n   - The operands are `True`.\n\n2. **Understand the precedence of operators**:\n   - The `not` operator has higher precedence than `and`. This means that `not` operations will be evaluated before `and`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `not` operations**:\n   - The expression has three `not` operators applied to `True`.\n   - Evaluate from right to left due to the precedence of `not`:\n     - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n     - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n     - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - After evaluating the `not` operations, the expression becomes `True and False`.\n\n5. **Evaluate the `and` operation**:\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n   - In this case, `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(True and not not not True)` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
