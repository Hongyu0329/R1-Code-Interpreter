    "To analyze the expression `not ( True or True ) and False`, we need to break it down step by step, considering the order of operations and logical operators involved.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The first step is to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is `True or True`.\n\n2. **Logical OR (`or`)**: The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. In this case, both operands are `True`, so `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **Negation (`not`)**: Next, we apply the `not` operator to the result of the expression inside the parentheses. The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. Since the result of `True or True` is `True`, applying `not` to it gives `not True`, which evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Logical AND (`and`)**: Finally, we evaluate the `and` operation. The expression now is `False and False`. The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since the first operand is `False`, the entire expression `False and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not ( True or True ) and False` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
