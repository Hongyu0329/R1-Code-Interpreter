    "To analyze the expression `not not False and not not not False`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operations involved. The logical operators we are dealing with are `not` and `and`.\n\n1. **Understanding `not`:**\n   - The `not` operator inverts the truth value of the operand. \n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n   - `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Understanding `and`:**\n   - The `and` operator results in `True` if both operands are `True`; otherwise, it results in `False`.\n\n3. **Breaking down the expression:**\n   - The expression is `not not False and not not not False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `not not False`:**\n   - First `not False` is evaluated, which is `True`.\n   - Then `not True` is evaluated, which is `False`.\n   - So, `not not False` simplifies to `False`.\n\n5. **Evaluate `not not not False`:**\n   - First `not False` is evaluated, which is `True`.\n   - Then `not True` is evaluated, which is `False`.\n   - Finally, `not False` is evaluated again, which is `True`.\n   - So, `not not not False` simplifies to `True`.\n\n6. **Combine the results with `and`:**\n   - Now we have `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator requires both operands to be `True` to result in `True`.\n   - Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression `not not False and not not not False` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
