    "To analyze the expression `not True or False and True and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operators and their precedence:**\n   - `not` has the highest precedence.\n   - `and` has the next highest precedence.\n   - `or` has the lowest precedence.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` operator:**\n   - The expression starts with `not True`. The `not` operator negates the value of `True`, resulting in `False`.\n\n3. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False or False and True and True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `and` operators:**\n   - According to precedence, evaluate `False and True` first. This results in `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n   - Substitute back into the expression: `False or False and True`.\n   - Next, evaluate `False and True`. This also results in `False`.\n\n5. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `False or False`.\n\n6. **Evaluate the `or` operator:**\n   - `False or False` results in `False` because at least one operand needs to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n\nThe final result of the expression is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
