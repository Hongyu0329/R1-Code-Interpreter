    "To analyze the given logical expression step by step, we need to understand the logical operators involved:\n\n1. **not**: This operator negates the truth value of the operand. If the operand is `True`, `not` makes it `False`, and vice versa.\n\n2. **and**: This operator results in `True` if both operands are `True`; otherwise, it results in `False`.\n\n3. **or**: This operator results in `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`; otherwise, it results in `False`.\n\nNow, let's break down the expression: `True and not not ( not False )`\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: \n   - Evaluate `not False`. \n   - `not False` is `True` because `not` negates `False`.\n\n2. **Double Negation**:\n   - Evaluate `not not (True)`.\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - So, `not not (True)` simplifies to `True`.\n\n3. **Final Expression**:\n   - Now, substitute back into the main expression: `True and True`.\n   - Since both operands are `True`, the result of `True and True` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression `True and not not ( not False )` is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
