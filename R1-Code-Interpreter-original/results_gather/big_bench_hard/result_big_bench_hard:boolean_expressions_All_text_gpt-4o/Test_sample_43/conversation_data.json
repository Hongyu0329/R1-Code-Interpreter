    "To analyze the expression `not False or True and not not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of operations for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not` operators first:**\n   - `not False` becomes `True` because `not` negates the value.\n   - `not not True` becomes `True` because the first `not` negates `True` to `False`, and the second `not` negates `False` back to `True`.\n\n   After evaluating the `not` operators, the expression becomes:\n   ```\n   True or True and True\n   ```\n\n2. **Evaluate `and` operator next:**\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True` because both operands are `True`.\n\n   After evaluating the `and` operator, the expression becomes:\n   ```\n   True or True\n   ```\n\n3. **Evaluate `or` operator last:**\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True` because at least one of the operands is `True`.\n\nThe final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the expression `not False or True and not not True` is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
