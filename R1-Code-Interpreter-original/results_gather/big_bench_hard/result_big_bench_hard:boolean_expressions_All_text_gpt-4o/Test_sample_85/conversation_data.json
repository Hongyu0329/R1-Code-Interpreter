    "To analyze the expression `not not (False and not False)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost Expression**: \n   - The innermost part of the expression is `not False`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Next Level**:\n   - Now, substitute `not False` with `True` in the expression: `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Here, `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **Outer `not` Operations**:\n   - The expression now becomes `not not False`.\n   - The first `not` negates `False`, turning it into `True`.\n   - The second `not` negates `True`, turning it back into `False`.\n\n4. **Final Evaluation**:\n   - The entire expression `not not (False and not False)` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
