    "To analyze the expression `not False or ( ( False ) )`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the logical operators involved. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the Operators and Operands:**\n   - The expression contains the logical operators `not` and `or`.\n   - The operands involved are `False` and the result of `not False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not False`:**\n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value it is applied to.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True` because negating `False` results in `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Expression Inside the Parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is simply `False`.\n   - Parentheses are used to group expressions, but in this case, they don't change the value since it's just `False`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `or` Operation:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of its operands is `True`.\n   - We have `True or False` to evaluate.\n   - Since `True` is one of the operands, the result of `True or False` is `True`.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The entire expression `not False or ( ( False ) )` simplifies to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
