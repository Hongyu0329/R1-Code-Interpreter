    "To analyze the expression `( False or True and not True )`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: The expression consists of three logical operators (`or`, `and`, `not`) and three boolean values (`False`, `True`, `True`).\n\n2. **Evaluate `not` first**: \n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value that follows it. \n   - In the expression, `not True` is evaluated first.\n   - `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n3. **Substitute the result back into the expression**: \n   - After evaluating `not True`, the expression becomes `( False or True and False )`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `and` next**:\n   - The `and` operator requires both operands to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n   - In the expression, `True and False` is evaluated next.\n   - `True and False` results in `False`.\n\n5. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - After evaluating `True and False`, the expression becomes `( False or False )`.\n\n6. **Evaluate `or` last**:\n   - The `or` operator requires at least one operand to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n   - In the expression, `False or False` is evaluated.\n   - `False or False` results in `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `( False or True and not True )` is `False`.\n\n<<<False>>>"
