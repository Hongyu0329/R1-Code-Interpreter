    "\nassistant > In this scenario, the administrative assistant is allowed to take pens, while faculty members are not. The problem arises because there are no pens left when the receptionist needs one. Since the administrative assistant is permitted to take pens, their action is not typically seen as causing the problem. Instead, the issue is more likely attributed to the faculty members, who are not supposed to take pens but do so anyway.\n\nTherefore, the typical person would likely answer:\n\n<<<No>>>"
