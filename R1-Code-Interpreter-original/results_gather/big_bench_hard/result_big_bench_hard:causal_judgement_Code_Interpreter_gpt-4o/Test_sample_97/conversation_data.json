  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To determine whether Alice caused the empty email to be sent, we need to consider the conditions under which the email is sent and the actions of both Alice and Zoe.\n\n1. The email is sent if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time.\n2. Zoe logged in at 9 am, violating the policy.\n3. Alice logged in at 9:30 am, following the policy, while Zoe was already logged in.\n\nIn this scenario, the email was sent because both Alice and Zoe were logged in simultaneously. Although Zoe violated the policy by logging in first, Alice's action of logging in while Zoe was already logged in directly contributed to the condition that caused the email to be sent.\n\nTherefore, from a causation perspective, Alice's action of logging in at 9:30 am did contribute to the sending of the email, even though she was following the policy.\n\nThe typical answer would be:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
