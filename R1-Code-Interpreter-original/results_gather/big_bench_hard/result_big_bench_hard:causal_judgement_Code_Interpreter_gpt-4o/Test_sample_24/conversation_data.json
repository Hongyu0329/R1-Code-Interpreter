  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Janet noticed that she did not put oil in the machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "\nassistant > In this scenario, Janet is responsible for putting oil in the machines, and she forgot to do so. Since it is explicitly stated that it is Janet's responsibility and not Kate's, the failure to oil the machine falls on Janet. The machine broke down a few days later, which suggests a causal link between Janet not putting oil in the machine and the machine breaking down.\n\nA typical person would likely conclude that Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down because it was her responsibility, and her failure to perform this task led to the machine's malfunction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
