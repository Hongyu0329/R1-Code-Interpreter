  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nClaire's parents bought her an old computer. Claire uses it for schoolwork, but her brother Daniel sometimes logs on to play games. Claire has told Daniel, \"Please don't log on to my computer. If we are both logged on at the same time, it will crash\". One day, Claire and Daniel logged on to the computer at the same time. The computer crashed. Later that day, Claire's mother is talking with the computer repairman. The repairman says, \"I see that Daniel was logged on, but this computer will only crash if two people are logged on at the same time. So, I still don't see quite why the computer crashed.\" Did Claire cause the computer crash?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > In this scenario, Claire explicitly warned Daniel that logging on simultaneously would cause the computer to crash. When both Claire and Daniel logged on at the same time, the computer crashed. The repairman noted that the computer crashes only when two people are logged on simultaneously, which aligns with Claire's warning.\n\nGiven this information, a typical person might reason that Claire's action of logging on, combined with Daniel's action, led to the crash. However, since Claire was using the computer for its intended purpose (schoolwork) and had warned Daniel not to log on simultaneously, the responsibility for the crash might be seen as more on Daniel's side for not heeding the warning.\n\nTherefore, a typical person might answer:\n\n<<<No>>>"
