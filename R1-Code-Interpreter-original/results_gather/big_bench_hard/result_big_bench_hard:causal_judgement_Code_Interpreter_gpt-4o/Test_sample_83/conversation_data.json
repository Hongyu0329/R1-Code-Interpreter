After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights and pulls the trigger-thereby killing the deer. Unfortunately, the bullet exited the deer's body and struck a hunter who was hiding nearby. Did the man intentionally shoot the hunter?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

Therefore, a typical person would likely conclude that the man did not intentionally shoot the other hunter.\n\n<<<No>>>"
