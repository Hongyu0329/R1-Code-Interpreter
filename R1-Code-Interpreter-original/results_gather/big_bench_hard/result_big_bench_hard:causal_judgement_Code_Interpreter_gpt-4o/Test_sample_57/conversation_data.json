  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nDrew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers at a small, local coffee shop. Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen all usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, as usual, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, Oliver ordered coffee, and Jen also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day. Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > In this scenario, the coffee shop will turn a profit if at least one person orders coffee. On Tuesday, all four regular customers, including Drew, ordered coffee. Since any one of them ordering coffee would have been sufficient for the coffee shop to make a profit, Drew's order was not necessary for the profit to occur. Therefore, a typical person might conclude that Drew ordering coffee did not cause the coffee shop to make a profit, as the profit would have occurred regardless of Drew's order due to the other customers also ordering coffee.\n\n<<<No>>>"
