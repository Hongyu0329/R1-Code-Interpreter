    "\nassistant > In this scenario, the deletion of emails is caused by both Billy and Suzy logging into the central computer at the same time. The company's policy allows both of them to log in during the morning, and neither Billy nor Suzy is aware of the consequence of simultaneous logins. \n\nFrom a typical person's perspective, causation often involves the idea of direct responsibility or intent. Since neither Billy nor Suzy intended to cause the deletion of emails, and both were following company policy, a typical person might not attribute direct causation to Suzy alone. Instead, they might see it as a joint or systemic issue rather than the fault of one individual.\n\nTherefore, the typical person might answer:\n\n<<<No>>>"
