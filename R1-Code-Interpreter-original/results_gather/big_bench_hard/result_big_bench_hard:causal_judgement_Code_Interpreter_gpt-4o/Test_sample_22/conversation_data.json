    "\nassistant > In this scenario, the responsibility to put oil in the machines lies with Janet, as she works in the maintenance department. Although Kate knows how to oil the machines, it is not her responsibility to do so if Janet forgets. Therefore, the primary cause of the machine breaking down is Janet's failure to put oil in it, not Kate's inaction. \n\nA typical person would likely conclude that Kate not putting oil in the machine did not cause it to break down, as it was not her responsibility to do so.\n\n<<<No>>>"
