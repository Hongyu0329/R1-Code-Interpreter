    "\nassistant > In this scenario, Janet is primarily responsible for putting oil into the machines. Kate is only responsible for doing so if Janet fails to do it. On June 1st, Janet forgot to put oil into the machine, which led to the machine breaking down. Since it was Kate's responsibility to put oil in the machine if Janet did not, the machine breaking down can be attributed to Kate not putting oil in the machine after Janet forgot.\n\nTherefore, the typical person might answer:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
