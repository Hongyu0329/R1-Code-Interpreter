  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > In this scenario, Janet is responsible for putting oil into the machines, and she forgot to do so. Since it is her responsibility and she failed to fulfill it, her action (or lack thereof) is directly linked to the machine breaking down. Kate, although knowledgeable about the machines, is not responsible for oiling them, so her inaction is not considered a cause of the breakdown.\n\nTherefore, a typical person would likely answer that Janet not putting oil in the machine did cause it to break down.\n\n<<<answer: Yes>>>"
