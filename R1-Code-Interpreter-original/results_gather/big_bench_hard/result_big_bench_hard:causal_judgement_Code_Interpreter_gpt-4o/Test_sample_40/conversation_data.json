Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Kylie, Oliver, and Jen all usually order coffee on Tuesdays. However, Drew doesn't usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, unexpectedly, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, Oliver ordered coffee, and Jen also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day. Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > In this scenario, the coffee shop will turn a profit if at least one person orders coffee. On this particular Tuesday, all four customers, including Drew, ordered coffee. The question is whether Drew ordering coffee caused the coffee shop to make a profit.\n\nSince Kylie, Oliver, and Jen usually order coffee on Tuesdays, the coffee shop would have made a profit regardless of Drew's order. Drew's order was not necessary for the coffee shop to make a profit because the other three customers already ensured profitability.\n\nTherefore, a typical person would likely conclude that Drew ordering coffee did not cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day.\n\n<<<No>>>"
