  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > In this scenario, the causation question revolves around whether Zoe's action of logging into the central computer contributed to the sending of the empty email. Since the condition for the email to be sent is that two people must be logged in simultaneously, both Alice and Zoe's actions are necessary for the email to be sent. Therefore, a typical person might reason that Zoe's login was indeed a contributing factor to the email being sent.\n\nThus, the answer would be:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
