  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > In this scenario, the responsibility to put oil in the machines lies with Janet, as she works in the maintenance department. Although Kate knows how to oil the machines, it is not her responsibility to do so. Therefore, the primary cause of the machine breaking down is Janet's failure to put oil in it. Kate's inaction is not considered a cause because it was not her duty to oil the machine.\n\nThus, the typical person would likely answer:\n\n<<<No>>>"
