    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- sound\n- consternate\n- tariff\n- blest\n- proximity\n- quizzes\n- xerxes\n- buxton\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. We can achieve this by using Python's `sorted()` function, which will return a new list that is sorted in ascending order. Let's write a Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"sound\", \"consternate\", \"tariff\", \"blest\", \"proximity\", \"quizzes\", \"xerxes\", \"buxton\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- blest\n- buxton\n- consternate\n- proximity\n- quizzes\n- sound\n- tariff\n- xerxes\n\nThis matches the expected outcome for sorting the words alphabetically. Since the task was straightforward and the code executed correctly without errors, we have achieved the desired result.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
