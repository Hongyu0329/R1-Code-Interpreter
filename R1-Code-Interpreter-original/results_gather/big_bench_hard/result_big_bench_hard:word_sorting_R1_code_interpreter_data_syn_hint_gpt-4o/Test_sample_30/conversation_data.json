    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- summand\n- cure\n- gloria\n- tyke\n- doubtful\n- extoller\n- entropy\n- crackle\n- procedural\n- cottrell\n- litigant\n- bologna\n\nWe will write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically and print the sorted list.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"summand\", \"cure\", \"gloria\", \"tyke\", \"doubtful\", \"extoller\", \"entropy\", \"crackle\", \"procedural\", \"cottrell\", \"litigant\", \"bologna\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome. The list of words was sorted correctly, and there were no errors in the execution. The task was straightforward and did not require complex symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms, as Python's built-in sorting function is efficient for this purpose.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n- bologna\n- cottrell\n- crackle\n- cure\n- doubtful\n- entropy\n- extoller\n- gloria\n- litigant\n- procedural\n- summand\n- tyke\n\nThis output matches the expected result of sorting the words alphabetically.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
