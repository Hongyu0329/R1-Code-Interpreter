    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words provided is:\n\n- indicate\n- quagmire\n- predacious\n- gut\n- vantage\n- marshal\n- across\n- smuggle\n- flight\n- directrix\n- admixture\n\nThe task is straightforward and can be efficiently handled using Python's built-in sorting functionality. We will write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically and print the sorted list.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"indicate\", \"quagmire\", \"predacious\", \"gut\", \"vantage\", \"marshal\", \"across\", \"smuggle\", \"flight\", \"directrix\", \"admixture\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome for this task. The task was to sort a list of words alphabetically, and the code successfully accomplished that.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n- across\n- admixture\n- directrix\n- flight\n- gut\n- indicate\n- marshal\n- predacious\n- quagmire\n- smuggle\n- vantage\n\nSince the task was straightforward and the code executed correctly without any errors, there is no need for further complex code or symbolic computing in this case. The task has been completed successfully.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
