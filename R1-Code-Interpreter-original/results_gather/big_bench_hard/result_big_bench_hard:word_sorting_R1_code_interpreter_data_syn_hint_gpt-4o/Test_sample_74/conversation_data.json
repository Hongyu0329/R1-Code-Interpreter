    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. This will allow us to efficiently sort the list and provide the final answer. Let's write a Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\n    \"murk\", \"pvc\", \"singlet\", \"yeats\", \"muslim\", \"coachmen\", \"clergymen\", \n    \"companion\", \"gazpacho\", \"embark\", \"pristine\", \"granular\", \"hobble\", \n    \"fatten\", \"allot\", \"too\", \"niggle\", \"chauncey\", \"threefold\", \"coddington\"\n]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome for this task. The task was to sort a list of words, and the code successfully accomplished that using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. The result is correct and matches the expected output.\n\nHere is the sorted list of words:\n\n1. allot\n2. chauncey\n3. clergymen\n4. coachmen\n5. coddington\n6. companion\n7. embark\n8. fatten\n9. gazpacho\n10. granular\n11. hobble\n12. murk\n13. muslim\n14. niggle\n15. pristine\n16. pvc\n17. singlet\n18. threefold\n19. too\n20. yeats\n\nThe task has been completed successfully, and the final answer is ready.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
