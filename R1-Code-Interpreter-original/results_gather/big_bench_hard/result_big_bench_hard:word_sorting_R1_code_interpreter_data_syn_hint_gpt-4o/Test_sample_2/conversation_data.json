    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to list all the words provided in the problem statement.\n2. **Sort the Words**: Use a sorting algorithm or a built-in function to sort the words alphabetically.\n3. **Output the Sorted List**: Finally, we will output the sorted list of words.\n\nThe list of words given is: \n- vegetate\n- artillery\n- harm\n- fda\n- doris\n- prosody\n- bainite\n- incongruous\n- monkey\n- vivian\n\nWe will use Python's built-in sorting functionality to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"vegetate\", \"artillery\", \"harm\", \"fda\", \"doris\", \"prosody\", \"bainite\", \"incongruous\", \"monkey\", \"vivian\"]\n\n# Sort the list of words alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome. The task was to sort the words, and the code successfully accomplished that using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. \n\nThe sorted list is:\n- artillery\n- bainite\n- doris\n- fda\n- harm\n- incongruous\n- monkey\n- prosody\n- vegetate\n- vivian\n\nSince the task was straightforward and the code execution was successful, there is no need for further complex symbolic computing or optimization in this case. The task has been completed as required.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
