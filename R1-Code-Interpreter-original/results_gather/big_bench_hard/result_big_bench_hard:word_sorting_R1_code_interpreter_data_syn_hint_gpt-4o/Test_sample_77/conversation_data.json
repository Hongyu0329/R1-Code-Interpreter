    "To solve the problem of sorting the words alphabetically, we need to arrange the given words in order based on the standard alphabetical order of the English language. The words provided are:\n\n1. oblong\n2. bucolic\n3. whoosh\n\nThe alphabetical order is determined by comparing the letters of each word starting from the first letter. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until a difference is found.\n\nLet's sort these words:\n\n- The first letter of \"bucolic\" is 'b', which comes before 'o' (the first letter of \"oblong\") and 'w' (the first letter of \"whoosh\").\n- The first letter of \"oblong\" is 'o', which comes before 'w' (the first letter of \"whoosh\").\n\nTherefore, the alphabetical order of the words is:\n\n1. bucolic\n2. oblong\n3. whoosh\n\nThus, the sorted list of words is: bucolic, oblong, whoosh.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
