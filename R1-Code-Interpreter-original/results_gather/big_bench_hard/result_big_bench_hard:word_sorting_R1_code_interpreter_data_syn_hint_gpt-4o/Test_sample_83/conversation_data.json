    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. List the words that need to be sorted: \n   - definite\n   - translate\n   - aggression\n   - arachne\n   - lengthy\n   - sanford\n   - bystander\n   - asplenium\n   - gneiss\n   - southeast\n\n2. Use Python's built-in sorting functionality to sort the list of words alphabetically. This can be done using the `sorted()` function, which will return a new list that is sorted in ascending order.\n\n3. Print the sorted list to verify the result.\n\nLet's implement this in a Python script:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"definite\", \"translate\", \"aggression\", \"arachne\", \"lengthy\", \"sanford\", \"bystander\", \"asplenium\", \"gneiss\", \"southeast\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result has provided the sorted list of words alphabetically. The task was to sort the given list of words, and the code has successfully achieved that. The sorted list is:\n\n- aggression\n- arachne\n- asplenium\n- bystander\n- definite\n- gneiss\n- lengthy\n- sanford\n- southeast\n- translate\n\nThis output matches the expected result of sorting the words alphabetically. Therefore, the task is complete.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
