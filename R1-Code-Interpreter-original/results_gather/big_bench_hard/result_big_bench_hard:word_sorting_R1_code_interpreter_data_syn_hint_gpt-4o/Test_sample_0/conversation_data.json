    "To solve the problem of sorting the words \"syndrome\" and \"therefrom\" alphabetically, we need to compare the words based on their lexicographical order. In alphabetical sorting, words are ordered based on the sequence of their letters as they appear in the alphabet.\n\n1. Compare the first letters of each word:\n   - \"syndrome\" starts with 's'\n   - \"therefrom\" starts with 't'\n\n2. In the English alphabet, 's' comes before 't'. Therefore, \"syndrome\" should come before \"therefrom\" in alphabetical order.\n\nThus, the sorted order of the words is: \"syndrome\", \"therefrom\".\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
