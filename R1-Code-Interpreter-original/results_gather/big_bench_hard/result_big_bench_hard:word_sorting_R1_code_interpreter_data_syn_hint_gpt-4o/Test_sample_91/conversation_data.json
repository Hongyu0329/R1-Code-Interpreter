    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. This will allow us to efficiently sort the list and provide the final answer.\n\nHere is the list of words that need to be sorted:\n- lung\n- secretive\n- cotman\n- coffman\n- quirinal\n- detour\n- rhubarb\n- notate\n- monologist\n- jacobean\n- gnostic\n- stove\n- collision\n- membrane\n- hammock\n- tobacco\n- backpack\n\nWe will write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\nwords = [\n    \"lung\", \"secretive\", \"cotman\", \"coffman\", \"quirinal\", \"detour\", \n    \"rhubarb\", \"notate\", \"monologist\", \"jacobean\", \"gnostic\", \"stove\", \n    \"collision\", \"membrane\", \"hammock\", \"tobacco\", \"backpack\"\n]\n\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words and print the sorted list. Let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code execution result has provided us with the sorted list of words. The task was to sort the given list of words alphabetically, and the code has successfully achieved that. The sorted list is:\n\n1. backpack\n2. coffman\n3. collision\n4. cotman\n5. detour\n6. gnostic\n7. hammock\n8. jacobean\n9. lung\n10. membrane\n11. monologist\n12. notate\n13. quirinal\n14. rhubarb\n15. secretive\n16. stove\n17. tobacco\n\nThe code used Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which is efficient for this task. Since the task was straightforward and did not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms, the simple sorting approach was appropriate.\n\nThe final answer is the sorted list of words as shown above.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
