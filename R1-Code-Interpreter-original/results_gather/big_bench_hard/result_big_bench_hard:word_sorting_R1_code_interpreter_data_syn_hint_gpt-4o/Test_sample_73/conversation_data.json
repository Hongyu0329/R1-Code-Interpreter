    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words is:\n\n- xylem\n- neoclassic\n- rest\n- fortieth\n- marshall\n- wiley\n- convey\n- experiment\n- whimper\n- kudo\n- decimate\n- incautious\n- z's\n\nThe task is straightforward and can be efficiently handled using Python's built-in sorting functions. We will use Python to sort the list of words alphabetically and then output the sorted list.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"xylem\", \"neoclassic\", \"rest\", \"fortieth\", \"marshall\", \"wiley\", \"convey\", \"experiment\", \"whimper\", \"kudo\", \"decimate\", \"incautious\", \"z's\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The task was to sort the words, and the code provided achieved this using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which is efficient for this purpose.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n- convey\n- decimate\n- experiment\n- fortieth\n- incautious\n- kudo\n- marshall\n- neoclassic\n- rest\n- whimper\n- wiley\n- xylem\n- z's\n\nSince the task was to sort the words alphabetically and the code has done this correctly, we have reached the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
