    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list provided is: \n\n- walnut\n- scoot\n- jugoslavia\n- retrorocket\n- polyhedron\n\nThe alphabetical order is determined by comparing the words character by character, starting from the first character. In Python, we can use the `sorted()` function to achieve this, which will return a new list that is sorted alphabetically.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\nwords = [\"walnut\", \"scoot\", \"jugoslavia\", \"retrorocket\", \"polyhedron\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome. The list of words sorted alphabetically is:\n\n1. jugoslavia\n2. polyhedron\n3. retrorocket\n4. scoot\n5. walnut\n\nThe code used the `sorted()` function, which is efficient for this task as it handles the sorting operation internally using an efficient algorithm. Since the task was to sort a small list of words alphabetically, the code was appropriate and provided the correct result.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
