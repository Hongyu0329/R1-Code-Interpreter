    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is: \"ecosystem\", \"cloudy\", \"ferret\", \"knotty\". \n\nThe steps to solve this are:\n1. Create a list with the given words.\n2. Use Python's `sorted()` function to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Print the sorted list.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these steps.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"ecosystem\", \"cloudy\", \"ferret\", \"knotty\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is: ['cloudy', 'ecosystem', 'ferret', 'knotty'].\n\nSince the task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has achieved this correctly, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\nThe final sorted list is: cloudy, ecosystem, ferret, knotty.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
