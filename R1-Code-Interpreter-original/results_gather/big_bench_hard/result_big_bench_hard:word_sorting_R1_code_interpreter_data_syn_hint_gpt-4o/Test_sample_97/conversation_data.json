    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words provided is:\n\n- crystallography\n- survey\n- bindle\n- rundown\n- shipshape\n- roadside\n- strange\n- chiang\n- dent\n- mambo\n- savannah\n- spew\n- won't\n- ram\n\nThe task is straightforward and can be efficiently handled using Python's built-in sorting functions. Let's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\n    \"crystallography\", \"survey\", \"bindle\", \"rundown\", \"shipshape\", \n    \"roadside\", \"strange\", \"chiang\", \"dent\", \"mambo\", \n    \"savannah\", \"spew\", \"won't\", \"ram\"\n]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome. The task was to sort a list of words, and the Python code used the `sorted()` function to achieve this efficiently. The result is correct and matches the expected output.\n\nThe sorted list of words is:\n- bindle\n- chiang\n- crystallography\n- dent\n- mambo\n- ram\n- roadside\n- rundown\n- savannah\n- shipshape\n- spew\n- strange\n- survey\n- won't\n\nSince the task was completed successfully and the output is correct, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
