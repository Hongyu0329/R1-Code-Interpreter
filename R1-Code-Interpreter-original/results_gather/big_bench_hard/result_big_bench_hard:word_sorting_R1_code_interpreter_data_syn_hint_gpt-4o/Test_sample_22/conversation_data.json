    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words provided is:\n\n- shouldn't\n- lorenz\n- runneth\n- skintight\n- plastisol\n- swept\n- coven\n- etruscan\n- disturb\n\nThe task is straightforward and can be efficiently handled using Python's built-in sorting functions. We will use Python to sort the list of words alphabetically and print the sorted list.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"shouldn't\", \"lorenz\", \"runneth\", \"skintight\", \"plastisol\", \"swept\", \"coven\", \"etruscan\", \"disturb\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis code will sort the list of words alphabetically and print the sorted list.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n1. coven\n2. disturb\n3. etruscan\n4. lorenz\n5. plastisol\n6. runneth\n7. shouldn't\n8. skintight\n9. swept\n\nThe task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has achieved this correctly. There were no errors in the execution, and the output matches the expected result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
