    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to arrange them in order based on the standard lexicographical order. The words provided are:\n\n- chlorate\n- glidden\n- incentive\n- manatee\n- spurt\n- lavoisier\n- judicatory\n\nThe process involves comparing each word with the others and arranging them in the order they would appear in a dictionary. This can be efficiently done using Python's built-in sorting functions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\nwords = [\"chlorate\", \"glidden\", \"incentive\", \"manatee\", \"spurt\", \"lavoisier\", \"judicatory\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result has provided us with the sorted list of words. The task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has successfully done that. The sorted list is:\n\n1. chlorate\n2. glidden\n3. incentive\n4. judicatory\n5. lavoisier\n6. manatee\n7. spurt\n\nThis list is in alphabetical order, as required. Since the task was straightforward and involved sorting a small list of words, the code used was simple and efficient for this purpose.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
