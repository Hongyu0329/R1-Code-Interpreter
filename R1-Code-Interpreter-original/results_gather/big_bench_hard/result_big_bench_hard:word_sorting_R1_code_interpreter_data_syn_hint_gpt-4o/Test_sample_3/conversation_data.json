    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is: \n\n- sioux\n- fortescue\n- purloin\n- percept\n- helmsman\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"sioux\", \"fortescue\", \"purloin\", \"percept\", \"helmsman\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- fortescue\n- helmsman\n- percept\n- purloin\n- sioux\n\nThis matches the expected outcome for sorting the words alphabetically. Since the task was straightforward and the code executed correctly without errors, there is no need for further complex code or symbolic computing in this case.\n\nThe final sorted list is:\n\n- fortescue\n- helmsman\n- percept\n- purloin\n- sioux\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
