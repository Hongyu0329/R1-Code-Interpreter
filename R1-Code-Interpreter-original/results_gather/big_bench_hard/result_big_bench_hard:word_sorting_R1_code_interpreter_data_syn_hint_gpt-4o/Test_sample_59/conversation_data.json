    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The task involves taking the list of words and applying a sorting algorithm to arrange them in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function is well-suited for this task as it sorts any iterable and returns a new list with the elements sorted.\n\nHere is the list of words that need to be sorted:\n- tipoff\n- fructose\n- coleus\n- hurricane\n- cite\n- tularemia\n- irreducible\n- wier\n- improbable\n- whitetail\n- vesper\n- whereabout\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\nwords = [\"tipoff\", \"fructose\", \"coleus\", \"hurricane\", \"cite\", \"tularemia\", \"irreducible\", \"wier\", \"improbable\", \"whitetail\", \"vesper\", \"whereabout\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will output the list of words sorted in alphabetical order. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The `sorted()` function in Python is efficient for this task, and the output matches the expected result of sorting the words in alphabetical order.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n1. cite\n2. coleus\n3. fructose\n4. hurricane\n5. improbable\n6. irreducible\n7. tipoff\n8. tularemia\n9. vesper\n10. whereabout\n11. whitetail\n12. wier\n\nSince the task was to sort the words alphabetically and the code has achieved this, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
