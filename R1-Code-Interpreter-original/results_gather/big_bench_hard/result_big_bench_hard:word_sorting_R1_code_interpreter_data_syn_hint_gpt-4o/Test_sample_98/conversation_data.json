    "To solve the problem of sorting the words \"deform\" and \"budd\" alphabetically, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. List the words that need to be sorted.\n2. Use Python's built-in sorting functionality to sort the list of words alphabetically.\n3. Print the sorted list to verify the result.\n\nLet's implement this in a Python script.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"deform\", \"budd\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the words \"budd\" and \"deform\" have been sorted alphabetically. The output `['budd', 'deform']` confirms that the sorting was successful.\n\nSince the task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has achieved this, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
