    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words provided is:\n\n- marimba\n- retrofit\n- alphabet\n- birmingham\n- philology\n- fashion\n- educate\n- mechanic\n- cantonese\n- fond\n- entourage\n\nThe task is straightforward: we will sort these words in alphabetical order. This can be efficiently done using Python's built-in sorting functions. Let's write a Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"marimba\", \"retrofit\", \"alphabet\", \"birmingham\", \"philology\", \"fashion\", \"educate\", \"mechanic\", \"cantonese\", \"fond\", \"entourage\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the list of words sorted alphabetically.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The output is as expected, and there are no errors in the code execution. The task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has achieved this.\n\nThe sorted list of words is:\n\n1. alphabet\n2. birmingham\n3. cantonese\n4. educate\n5. entourage\n6. fashion\n7. fond\n8. marimba\n9. mechanic\n10. philology\n11. retrofit\n\nSince the task is complete and the output is correct, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
