    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. List the words: \"coypu\", \"anharmonic\", \"inflammation\", \"beauteous\".\n2. Sort the words in alphabetical order.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. Let's write a simple script to sort the list of words.\n\n```python\nwords = [\"coypu\", \"anharmonic\", \"inflammation\", \"beauteous\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is: ['anharmonic', 'beauteous', 'coypu', 'inflammation'].\n\nThis task was straightforward and did not require complex symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms, as Python's built-in sorting function is efficient for this purpose.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
