    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to arrange them in order based on the standard lexicographical order. This means comparing the words character by character according to their ASCII values.\n\nThe list of words provided is:\n- shreveport\n- gamut\n- berg\n- multiplexor\n- bluish\n- puerto\n- subliminal\n\nTo achieve this, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality, which will handle the comparison and ordering for us efficiently.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\nwords = [\"shreveport\", \"gamut\", \"berg\", \"multiplexor\", \"bluish\", \"puerto\", \"subliminal\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will output the words in alphabetical order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome. The words have been arranged in the following order:\n\n1. berg\n2. bluish\n3. gamut\n4. multiplexor\n5. puerto\n6. shreveport\n7. subliminal\n\nThis order is correct based on the lexicographical sorting of the words. Since the task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has successfully done that, we have achieved the correct result.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
