    "To solve the problem of sorting the words alphabetically, we need to arrange the given words in order based on the standard alphabetical order. The words provided are \"thunder,\" \"phase,\" and \"geld.\"\n\nThe alphabetical order is determined by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the next letter, and so on, until we can determine the order.\n\nLet's break down the words:\n\n1. \"thunder\" starts with 't'\n2. \"phase\" starts with 'p'\n3. \"geld\" starts with 'g'\n\nIn the English alphabet, 'g' comes before 'p', and 'p' comes before 't'. Therefore, the correct alphabetical order of the words is \"geld,\" \"phase,\" \"thunder.\"\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>['geld', 'phase', 'thunder']<<<answer>>>"
