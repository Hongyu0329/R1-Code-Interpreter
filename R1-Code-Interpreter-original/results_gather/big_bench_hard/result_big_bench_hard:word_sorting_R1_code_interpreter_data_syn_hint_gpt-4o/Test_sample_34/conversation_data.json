    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list provided is: \"dulse\", \"kowalewski\", \"yew\", \"politician\". \n\nThe alphabetical order is determined by comparing the Unicode values of the characters in the words. In Python, we can use the built-in `sorted()` function to sort a list of strings alphabetically.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\nwords = [\"dulse\", \"kowalewski\", \"yew\", \"politician\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code execution result has provided us with the sorted list of words: ['dulse', 'kowalewski', 'politician', 'yew']. This is the correct alphabetical order for the given list of words.\n\nSince the task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has successfully done that, we can now provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
