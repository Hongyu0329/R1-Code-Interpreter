    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is: \n\n- regret\n- starlight\n- wallboard\n- cotyledon\n- more\n- pepperoni\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. We can achieve this by using Python's `sorted()` function, which will return a new list containing all items from the original list in ascending order.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this task:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"regret\", \"starlight\", \"wallboard\", \"cotyledon\", \"more\", \"pepperoni\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words and print the sorted list. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n1. cotyledon\n2. more\n3. pepperoni\n4. regret\n5. starlight\n6. wallboard\n\nThe task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has achieved this correctly. There were no errors in the execution, and the output matches the expected result.\n\nSince the task is straightforward and involves sorting a list of words, the use of Python's built-in `sorted()` function is both efficient and appropriate for this problem. There is no need for symbolic computing or complex algorithms in this case.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> ['cotyledon', 'more', 'pepperoni', 'regret', 'starlight', 'wallboard']"
