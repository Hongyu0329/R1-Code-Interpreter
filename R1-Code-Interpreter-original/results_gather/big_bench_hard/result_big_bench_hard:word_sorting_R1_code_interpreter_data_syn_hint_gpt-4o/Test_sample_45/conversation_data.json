    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words is:\n\n- episode\n- molybdenum\n- schedule\n- hen\n- sparkman\n- calabash\n- marietta\n- pedantic\n- pounce\n- vinaigrette\n- berra\n\nThe task is straightforward and can be efficiently handled using Python's built-in sorting functions. We will write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically and print the sorted list.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\n    \"episode\", \"molybdenum\", \"schedule\", \"hen\", \"sparkman\", \n    \"calabash\", \"marietta\", \"pedantic\", \"pounce\", \"vinaigrette\", \"berra\"\n]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result has provided us with the sorted list of words. The task was to sort the given list of words alphabetically, and the code has successfully done that. The sorted list is:\n\n- berra\n- calabash\n- episode\n- hen\n- marietta\n- molybdenum\n- pedantic\n- pounce\n- schedule\n- sparkman\n- vinaigrette\n\nThis output matches the expected result of sorting the words alphabetically. Therefore, we have achieved the desired outcome.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
