    "To solve the problem of sorting the words \"kenya\" and \"beth\" alphabetically, we need to compare the words based on the lexicographical order of their characters. In alphabetical sorting, words are ordered based on the sequence of letters in the alphabet.\n\n1. Compare the first letters of each word:\n   - \"kenya\" starts with 'k'\n   - \"beth\" starts with 'b'\n\n2. Since 'b' comes before 'k' in the alphabet, \"beth\" should come before \"kenya\" in the sorted list.\n\nTherefore, the sorted order of the words is: \"beth\", \"kenya\".\n\n<<<answer>>>['beth', 'kenya']<<<answer>>>"
