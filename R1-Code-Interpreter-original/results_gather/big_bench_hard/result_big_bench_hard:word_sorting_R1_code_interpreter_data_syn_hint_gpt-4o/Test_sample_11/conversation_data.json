    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The process involves:\n\n1. Creating a list of the given words.\n2. Using Python's `sorted()` function to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Printing the sorted list.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\n    \"scrumptious\", \"sidereal\", \"thermal\", \"yakima\", \"siena\", \"gorky\", \"saxon\", \n    \"scottish\", \"figural\", \"hydroxyl\", \"seventeen\", \"neapolitan\", \"rampage\", \n    \"nerve\", \"grapple\", \"fate\", \"plainfield\", \"stooge\", \"knives\", \"allotted\"\n]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the expected outcome. The task was to sort the given list of words alphabetically, and the code successfully accomplished that.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n- allotted\n- fate\n- figural\n- gorky\n- grapple\n- hydroxyl\n- knives\n- neapolitan\n- nerve\n- plainfield\n- rampage\n- saxon\n- scottish\n- scrumptious\n- seventeen\n- sidereal\n- siena\n- stooge\n- thermal\n- yakima\n\nSince the task is straightforward and the code execution was successful, there is no need for further complex symbolic computing or optimization in this case. The task was completed correctly.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
