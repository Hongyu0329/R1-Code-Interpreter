    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to have the list of words that need to be sorted.\n2. **Sort the List**: Use a sorting algorithm or a built-in function to sort the list of words alphabetically.\n3. **Output the Sorted List**: Finally, we will output the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this using Python code to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"lucrative\", \"you've\", \"tunnel\", \"archery\", \"bride\", \"coquette\", \"polytypy\", \"barbudo\", \"radix\", \"arlen\", \"lockwood\", \"teem\", \"officious\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The task was to sort the words, and the code provided achieved that using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which is efficient for this purpose.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n- archery\n- arlen\n- barbudo\n- bride\n- coquette\n- lockwood\n- lucrative\n- officious\n- polytypy\n- radix\n- teem\n- tunnel\n- you've\n\nThe task does not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms, as sorting a list of words alphabetically is a straightforward task that can be efficiently handled by the built-in sorting functions in Python.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the sorted list of words.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
