    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The words provided are: \"lise\", \"snipe\", and \"miaow\". \n\nLet's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\nwords = [\"lise\", \"snipe\", \"miaow\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words and print the sorted list. Let's execute this code to get the sorted order.",
    "The code execution result shows that the words have been sorted alphabetically as expected. The list `['lise', 'miaow', 'snipe']` is the correct alphabetical order of the given words.\n\nSince the task was to sort the words alphabetically and the code has successfully done that, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
