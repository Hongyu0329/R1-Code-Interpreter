    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to compare the words based on their lexicographical order. The words provided are \"yeager\", \"bengal\", and \"fettle\". \n\nIn alphabetical sorting:\n- Words are compared character by character from left to right.\n- The word with the character that comes first in the alphabet is considered smaller.\n- If the first characters are the same, the next characters are compared, and so on.\n\nLet's sort the words:\n\n1. Compare \"yeager\" and \"bengal\":\n   - \"b\" (from \"bengal\") comes before \"y\" (from \"yeager\"), so \"bengal\" is smaller.\n\n2. Compare \"bengal\" and \"fettle\":\n   - \"b\" (from \"bengal\") comes before \"f\" (from \"fettle\"), so \"bengal\" is smaller.\n\n3. Compare \"fettle\" and \"yeager\":\n   - \"f\" (from \"fettle\") comes before \"y\" (from \"yeager\"), so \"fettle\" is smaller.\n\nThus, the sorted order is: \"bengal\", \"fettle\", \"yeager\".\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to sort the list.\n\n```python\nwords = [\"yeager\", \"bengal\", \"fettle\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the sorted order.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the words are sorted alphabetically as expected: \"bengal\", \"fettle\", \"yeager\". The task of sorting words alphabetically is straightforward and does not require complex symbolic computing or advanced algorithms, as it can be efficiently handled by Python's built-in `sorted()` function.\n\nSince the code execution result matches the expected outcome, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
