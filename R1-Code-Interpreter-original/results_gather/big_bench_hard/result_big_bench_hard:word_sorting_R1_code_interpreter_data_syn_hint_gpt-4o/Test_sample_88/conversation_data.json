    "To solve the problem of sorting the words alphabetically, we need to arrange the given words in order based on the standard alphabetical order of the English language. The words provided are \"wreak,\" \"hidebound,\" and \"bandwidth.\"\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the first letter of each word**: \n   - \"wreak\" starts with 'w'\n   - \"hidebound\" starts with 'h'\n   - \"bandwidth\" starts with 'b'\n\n2. **Compare the first letters**: \n   - 'b' comes before 'h' and 'w' in the alphabet.\n   - 'h' comes before 'w' in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Order the words based on the first letter**:\n   - \"bandwidth\" should come first.\n   - \"hidebound\" should come second.\n   - \"wreak\" should come last.\n\nThus, the words sorted alphabetically are: \"bandwidth,\" \"hidebound,\" \"wreak.\"\n\n<<<answer>>>['bandwidth', 'hidebound', 'wreak']<<<answer>>>"
