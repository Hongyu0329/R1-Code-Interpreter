    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words is:\n\n- consignee\n- can't\n- artistry\n- golf\n- cascade\n- markov\n- nine\n- swingable\n- shanghai\n- condiment\n- projectile\n- mimosa\n- glance\n- gentlemen\n- wildflower\n- tale\n\nThe sorting process involves comparing the words based on their lexicographical order. In Python, we can use the built-in `sorted()` function to achieve this. Let's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\nwords = [\n    \"consignee\", \"can't\", \"artistry\", \"golf\", \"cascade\", \"markov\", \n    \"nine\", \"swingable\", \"shanghai\", \"condiment\", \"projectile\", \n    \"mimosa\", \"glance\", \"gentlemen\", \"wildflower\", \"tale\"\n]\n\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result has provided us with the sorted list of words. The task was to sort the given list of words alphabetically, and the code has successfully achieved that. The sorted list is:\n\n1. artistry\n2. can't\n3. cascade\n4. condiment\n5. consignee\n6. gentlemen\n7. glance\n8. golf\n9. markov\n10. mimosa\n11. nine\n12. projectile\n13. shanghai\n14. swingable\n15. tale\n16. wildflower\n\nThe code used the `sorted()` function, which is efficient for this task, as it sorts the list in lexicographical order. Since the task is straightforward and the code has provided the correct output, there is no need for further complex symbolic computing or optimization in this case.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
