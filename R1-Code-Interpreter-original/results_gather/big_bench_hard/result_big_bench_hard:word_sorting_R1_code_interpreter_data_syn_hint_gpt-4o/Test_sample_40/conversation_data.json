    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The task involves taking the list of words and arranging them in alphabetical order. Python provides a straightforward way to sort lists using the `sorted()` function, which will be efficient for this task.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list of words alphabetically.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"skinny\", \"sharon\", \"sudan\", \"earthy\", \"parentage\", \"hello\", \"inmate\", \"announce\", \"co\", \"clayton\", \"carp\", \"phonetic\", \"watson\", \"nimbus\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words and print the sorted list. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The task was straightforward and did not require complex symbolic computing or advanced searching algorithms, as Python's built-in sorting function is efficient for this purpose.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n- announce\n- carp\n- clayton\n- co\n- earthy\n- hello\n- inmate\n- nimbus\n- parentage\n- phonetic\n- sharon\n- skinny\n- sudan\n- watson\n\nThis output matches the expected result of sorting the words alphabetically.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
