    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- whale\n- nevins\n- puree\n- pusey\n- protein\n- pullman\n- benefice\n- squeamish\n- river\n- improvise\n\nThe task is to arrange these words in alphabetical order. We can achieve this by using Python's `sorted()` function, which will return a new list that is sorted in ascending order. Let's write a Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"whale\", \"nevins\", \"puree\", \"pusey\", \"protein\", \"pullman\", \"benefice\", \"squeamish\", \"river\", \"improvise\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n1. benefice\n2. improvise\n3. nevins\n4. protein\n5. pullman\n6. puree\n7. pusey\n8. river\n9. squeamish\n10. whale\n\nThe task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code provided achieved this using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which is efficient for this purpose. Since the task is straightforward and does not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms, the solution is appropriate.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
