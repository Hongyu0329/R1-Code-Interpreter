    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- above\n- prometheus\n- broken\n- coexist\n- big\n- dominate\n- olive\n- screw\n- thirdhand\n- irk\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the sorted result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"above\", \"prometheus\", \"broken\", \"coexist\", \"big\", \"dominate\", \"olive\", \"screw\", \"thirdhand\", \"irk\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome. The list of words sorted alphabetically is:\n\n- above\n- big\n- broken\n- coexist\n- dominate\n- irk\n- olive\n- prometheus\n- screw\n- thirdhand\n\nThe task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code successfully achieved this. There were no errors in the execution, and the output is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
