    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The words provided are: \"thunderclap\", \"swab\", \"built\", and \"poland\". \n\nThe process involves:\n1. Creating a list with the given words.\n2. Using Python's `sorted()` function to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Printing the sorted list.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"thunderclap\", \"swab\", \"built\", \"poland\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result shows that the list of words has been successfully sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is: ['built', 'poland', 'swab', 'thunderclap'].\n\nSince the task was to sort the words alphabetically, and the code has achieved this, there is no need for further complex code or symbolic computing in this case. The task is straightforward and does not require optimization or advanced techniques.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> ['built', 'poland', 'swab', 'thunderclap']"
