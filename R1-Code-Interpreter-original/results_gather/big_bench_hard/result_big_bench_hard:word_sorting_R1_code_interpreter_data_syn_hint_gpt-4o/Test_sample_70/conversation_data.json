    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. List the words that need to be sorted.\n2. Use Python's built-in sorting functionality to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Print the sorted list.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"testy\", \"trench\", \"sin\", \"rheumatic\", \"shivery\", \"orphanage\", \"functor\", \"zorn\", \"butadiene\", \"spec\", \"racy\", \"heck\", \"flair\", \"snowball\", \"booby\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words alphabetically, which is the desired outcome. The task was to sort the given list of words, and the code successfully accomplished that.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n- booby\n- butadiene\n- flair\n- functor\n- heck\n- orphanage\n- racy\n- rheumatic\n- shivery\n- sin\n- snowball\n- spec\n- testy\n- trench\n- zorn\n\nSince the task was straightforward and the code execution was successful, there is no need for further complex code or symbolic computing in this case. The task has been completed as required.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
