    "To solve the problem of sorting the words alphabetically, we need to arrange the given words in order based on the standard alphabetical order. The words provided are \"sortie\", \"neff\", and \"nicodemus\". \n\nThe alphabetical order is determined by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, the second letters are compared, and so on. \n\nLet's sort the words:\n\n1. \"neff\" starts with 'n'.\n2. \"nicodemus\" also starts with 'n', but the second letter 'i' comes after 'e' in \"neff\".\n3. \"sortie\" starts with 's', which comes after 'n'.\n\nTherefore, the alphabetical order of the words is: \"neff\", \"nicodemus\", \"sortie\".\n\n<<<'neff, nicodemus, sortie'>>>"
