    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to compare the words based on their lexicographical order. The words provided are \"slurp\", \"raytheon\", and \"gloucester\". \n\nIn alphabetical order, we compare the first letter of each word. If they are the same, we move to the next letter, and so on, until we find a difference. \n\nLet's sort the words:\n\n1. \"gloucester\" starts with 'g'.\n2. \"raytheon\" starts with 'r'.\n3. \"slurp\" starts with 's'.\n\nIn alphabetical order, 'g' comes before 'r', and 'r' comes before 's'. Therefore, the sorted order of the words is:\n\n1. \"gloucester\"\n2. \"raytheon\"\n3. \"slurp\"\n\nThus, the words sorted alphabetically are: \"gloucester\", \"raytheon\", \"slurp\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
