    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The task involves taking the list of words, applying the sorting function, and then outputting the sorted list. Let's proceed with the code to achieve this.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\n    \"matte\", \"game\", \"aldebaran\", \"inkling\", \"fiberboard\", \"pulsate\", \n    \"lakeside\", \"shape\", \"mcgee\", \"watchworks\", \"entrepreneurial\", \n    \"boxwood\", \"peruse\", \"backyard\", \"cabbage\", \"polyhedra\", \n    \"lightface\", \"rowley\", \"rae\", \"invincible\"\n]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the sorted list of words.",
    "The code execution result provided the sorted list of words correctly. The task was to sort a list of words alphabetically, which was achieved using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This function is efficient for this type of task, as it uses Timsort, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, providing good performance for real-world data.\n\nSince the task is straightforward and the code execution result is correct, there is no need for more complex symbolic computing or optimization in this context. The task was completed successfully with the provided code.\n\nHere is the final sorted list of words:\n\n['aldebaran', 'backyard', 'boxwood', 'cabbage', 'entrepreneurial', 'fiberboard', 'game', 'inkling', 'invincible', 'lakeside', 'lightface', 'matte', 'mcgee', 'peruse', 'polyhedra', 'pulsate', 'rae', 'rowley', 'shape', 'watchworks']\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
