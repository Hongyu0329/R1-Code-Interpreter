    "\nassistant > In the sentence \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint,\" the pronoun \"them\" is used. The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is unknown or unspecified. In this context, \"them\" could refer to either the designer or the carpenter, but since it is used in a singular context (as only one blueprint is mentioned), it is ambiguous. The sentence does not clearly specify whether the blueprint was given to the designer or the carpenter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
