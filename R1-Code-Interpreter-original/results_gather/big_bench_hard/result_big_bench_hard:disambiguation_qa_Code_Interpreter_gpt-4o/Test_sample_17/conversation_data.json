    "\nassistant > In the sentence \"The supervisor gave the employee feedback on his stellar performance,\" the pronoun \"his\" is used. The context suggests that the feedback is likely about the employee's performance, as it is more common for a supervisor to give feedback on an employee's performance rather than their own. Therefore, the antecedent of \"his\" is most likely the employee.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) It was the employee's performance <<<answer>>>"
