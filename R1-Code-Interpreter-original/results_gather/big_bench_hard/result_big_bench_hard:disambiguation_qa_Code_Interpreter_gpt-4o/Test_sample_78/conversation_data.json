    "\nassistant > The pronoun \"they\" in the sentence refers to the person who asked for help. In this context, \"they\" could refer to either \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO,\" as both are mentioned in the sentence. However, it is more logical to assume that \"they\" refers to \"the CEO\" because it is more likely that the CEO would ask for help in finding a book, and the librarian would be the one providing assistance. Therefore, the antecedent of \"they\" is most likely \"the CEO.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The CEO asked <<<answer>>>"
