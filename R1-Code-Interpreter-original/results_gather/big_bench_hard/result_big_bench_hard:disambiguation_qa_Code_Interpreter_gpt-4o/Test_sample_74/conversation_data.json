    "\nassistant > In the sentence \"The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave them a prototype,\" the pronoun \"them\" is used. The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is not specified. In this context, \"them\" could refer to either the carpenter or the designer, but since it is used in a singular context (referring to one person), it is more likely referring to the designer, as \"them\" is often used as a gender-neutral singular pronoun. However, without additional context, it is not entirely clear, making it ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>>C<<<answer>>>"
