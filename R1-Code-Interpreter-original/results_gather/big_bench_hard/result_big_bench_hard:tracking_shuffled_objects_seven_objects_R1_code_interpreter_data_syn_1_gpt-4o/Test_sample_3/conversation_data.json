  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Ophelia, Bob is dancing with Melissa, Claire is dancing with Jamie, Dave is dancing with Sam, Eve is dancing with Patrick, Fred is dancing with Rodrigo, and Gertrude is dancing with Karl.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Dave and Claire switch partners. Then, Alice and Eve switch partners. Then, Eve and Bob switch partners. Then, Claire and Bob switch partners. Then, Fred and Eve switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Dave switch partners. Finally, Dave and Alice switch partners. At the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Ophelia\n(B) Melissa\n(C) Jamie\n(D) Sam\n(E) Patrick\n(F) Rodrigo\n(G) Karl\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. We start with the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence to determine who Dave is dancing with at the end.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Ophelia\n- Bob with Melissa\n- Claire with Jamie\n- Dave with Sam\n- Eve with Patrick\n- Fred with Rodrigo\n- Gertrude with Karl\n\nLet's go through the partner switches:\n\n1. **Dave and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Dave with Jamie\n   - Claire with Sam\n\n2. **Alice and Eve switch partners:**\n   - Alice with Patrick\n   - Eve with Ophelia\n\n3. **Eve and Bob switch partners:**\n   - Eve with Melissa\n   - Bob with Ophelia\n\n4. **Claire and Bob switch partners:**\n   - Claire with Ophelia\n   - Bob with Sam\n\n5. **Fred and Eve switch partners:**\n   - Fred with Melissa\n   - Eve with Rodrigo\n\n6. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:**\n   - Gertrude with Jamie\n   - Dave with Karl\n\n7. **Dave and Alice switch partners:**\n   - Dave with Patrick\n   - Alice with Karl\n\nAfter applying all the switches, Dave ends up dancing with Patrick. Let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    \"Alice\": \"Ophelia\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Melissa\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Jamie\",\n    \"Dave\": \"Sam\",\n    \"Eve\": \"Patrick\",\n    \"Fred\": \"Rodrigo\",\n    \"Gertrude\": \"Karl\"\n}\n\n# Function to switch partners\ndef switch_partners(person1, person2):\n    partners[person1], partners[person2] = partners[person2], partners[person1]\n\n# Apply the partner switches\nswitch_partners(\"Dave\", \"Claire\")\nswitch_partners(\"Alice\", \"Eve\")\nswitch_partners(\"Eve\", \"Bob\")\nswitch_partners(\"Claire\", \"Bob\")\nswitch_partners(\"Fred\", \"Eve\")\nswitch_partners(\"Gertrude\", \"Dave\")\nswitch_partners(\"Dave\", \"Alice\")\n\n# Output Dave's final partner\nprint(partners[\"Dave\"])\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the final partner of Dave.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the partner switches, Dave ends up dancing with Patrick. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
