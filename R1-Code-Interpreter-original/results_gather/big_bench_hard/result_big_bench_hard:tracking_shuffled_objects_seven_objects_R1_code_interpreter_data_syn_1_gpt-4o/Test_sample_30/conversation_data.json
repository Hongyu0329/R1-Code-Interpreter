    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as they are swapped among the friends. We will start by assigning each person their initial book and then apply each swap in sequence to determine the final book each person has. Finally, we will check which book Gertrude has at the end.\n\nLet's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. Initial assignment:\n   - Alice: Ulysses\n   - Bob: Frankenstein\n   - Claire: Moby Dick\n   - Dave: The Odyssey\n   - Eve: The Great Gatsby\n   - Fred: Lolita\n   - Gertrude: The Pearl\n\n2. Swaps:\n   - Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets Moby Dick, Claire gets Frankenstein\n   - Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets Ulysses, Alice gets The Great Gatsby\n   - Alice and Dave swap: Alice gets The Odyssey, Dave gets The Great Gatsby\n   - Gertrude and Dave swap: Gertrude gets The Great Gatsby, Dave gets The Pearl\n   - Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets Moby Dick, Bob gets The Odyssey\n   - Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets Frankenstein, Claire gets Ulysses\n   - Alice and Fred swap: Alice gets Lolita, Fred gets Moby Dick\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to track the swaps and determine the final book Gertrude has.\n\n```python\n# Initial book assignment\nbooks = {\n    \"Alice\": \"Ulysses\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Frankenstein\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Moby Dick\",\n    \"Dave\": \"The Odyssey\",\n    \"Eve\": \"The Great Gatsby\",\n    \"Fred\": \"Lolita\",\n    \"Gertrude\": \"The Pearl\"\n}\n\n# List of swaps\nswaps = [\n    (\"Bob\", \"Claire\"),\n    (\"Eve\", \"Alice\"),\n    (\"Alice\", \"Dave\"),\n    (\"Gertrude\", \"Dave\"),\n    (\"Alice\", \"Bob\"),\n    (\"Eve\", \"Claire\"),\n    (\"Alice\", \"Fred\")\n]\n\n# Perform the swaps\nfor person1, person2 in swaps:\n    books[person1], books[person2] = books[person2], books[person1]\n\n# Output the final book Gertrude has\nprint(books[\"Gertrude\"])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out which book Gertrude has at the end of the semester.",
    "Based on the code execution, Gertrude ends up with \"The Great Gatsby\" at the end of the semester after all the swaps have been completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
