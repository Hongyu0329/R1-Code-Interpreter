  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Jamie, Bob is dancing with Ophelia, Claire is dancing with Lola, Dave is dancing with Patrick, Eve is dancing with Rodrigo, Fred is dancing with Melissa, and Gertrude is dancing with Karl.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Eve and Dave switch partners. Then, Fred and Eve switch partners. Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Dave and Bob switch partners. Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners. Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. At the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Jamie\n(B) Ophelia\n(C) Lola\n(D) Patrick\n(E) Rodrigo\n(F) Melissa\n(G) Karl\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes throughout the dance. We start with the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice with Jamie\n   - Bob with Ophelia\n   - Claire with Lola\n   - Dave with Patrick\n   - Eve with Rodrigo\n   - Fred with Melissa\n   - Gertrude with Karl\n\n2. **Switches:**\n   - Eve and Dave switch partners: \n     - Eve with Patrick\n     - Dave with Rodrigo\n   - Fred and Eve switch partners:\n     - Fred with Patrick\n     - Eve with Melissa\n   - Alice and Gertrude switch partners:\n     - Alice with Karl\n     - Gertrude with Jamie\n   - Dave and Bob switch partners:\n     - Dave with Ophelia\n     - Bob with Rodrigo\n   - Alice and Claire switch partners:\n     - Alice with Lola\n     - Claire with Karl\n   - Alice and Gertrude switch partners:\n     - Alice with Jamie\n     - Gertrude with Lola\n   - Bob and Claire switch partners:\n     - Bob with Karl\n     - Claire with Rodrigo\n\nAfter applying all these switches, we need to determine who Gertrude is dancing with at the end. Let's implement this in Python to track the changes efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Jamie',\n    'Bob': 'Ophelia',\n    'Claire': 'Lola',\n    'Dave': 'Patrick',\n    'Eve': 'Rodrigo',\n    'Fred': 'Melissa',\n    'Gertrude': 'Karl'\n}\n\n# Function to switch partners\ndef switch(partners, dancer1, dancer2):\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Apply the switches\nswitch(partners, 'Eve', 'Dave')\nswitch(partners, 'Fred', 'Eve')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Gertrude')\nswitch(partners, 'Dave', 'Bob')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Claire')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Gertrude')\nswitch(partners, 'Bob', 'Claire')\n\n# Find Gertrude's partner at the end\ngertrude_partner = partners['Gertrude']\nprint(gertrude_partner)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out who Gertrude is dancing with at the end.",
    "Based on the code execution, Gertrude is dancing with Lola at the end of the dance. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<Lola>>>"
