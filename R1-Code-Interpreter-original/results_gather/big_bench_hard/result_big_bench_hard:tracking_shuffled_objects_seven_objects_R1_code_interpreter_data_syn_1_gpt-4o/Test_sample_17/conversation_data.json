  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Sam, Bob is dancing with Rodrigo, Claire is dancing with Jamie, Dave is dancing with Lola, Eve is dancing with Helga, Fred is dancing with Melissa, and Gertrude is dancing with Ophelia.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Bob and Dave switch partners. Then, Dave and Claire switch partners. Then, Claire and Eve switch partners. Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners. Then, Bob and Fred switch partners. Finally, Fred and Eve switch partners. At the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Sam\n(B) Rodrigo\n(C) Jamie\n(D) Lola\n(E) Helga\n(F) Melissa\n(G) Ophelia\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes throughout the dance. We will start by setting up the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence to determine who Dave is dancing with at the end.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Sam\n- Bob with Rodrigo\n- Claire with Jamie\n- Dave with Lola\n- Eve with Helga\n- Fred with Melissa\n- Gertrude with Ophelia\n\nLet's go through the partner switches step by step:\n\n1. Bob and Dave switch partners:\n   - Bob with Lola\n   - Dave with Rodrigo\n\n2. Dave and Claire switch partners:\n   - Dave with Jamie\n   - Claire with Rodrigo\n\n3. Claire and Eve switch partners:\n   - Claire with Helga\n   - Eve with Rodrigo\n\n4. Alice and Gertrude switch partners:\n   - Alice with Ophelia\n   - Gertrude with Sam\n\n5. Alice and Bob switch partners:\n   - Alice with Lola\n   - Bob with Ophelia\n\n6. Bob and Fred switch partners:\n   - Bob with Melissa\n   - Fred with Ophelia\n\n7. Fred and Eve switch partners:\n   - Fred with Rodrigo\n   - Eve with Ophelia\n\nNow, let's determine who Dave is dancing with at the end of the dance. We will implement this sequence of partner changes in a Python script to track the final partner of Dave.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Sam',\n    'Bob': 'Rodrigo',\n    'Claire': 'Jamie',\n    'Dave': 'Lola',\n    'Eve': 'Helga',\n    'Fred': 'Melissa',\n    'Gertrude': 'Ophelia'\n}\n\n# Function to switch partners\ndef switch(partners, dancer1, dancer2):\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Apply the partner switches\nswitch(partners, 'Bob', 'Dave')\nswitch(partners, 'Dave', 'Claire')\nswitch(partners, 'Claire', 'Eve')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Gertrude')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Bob')\nswitch(partners, 'Bob', 'Fred')\nswitch(partners, 'Fred', 'Eve')\n\n# Output the final partner of Dave\nprint(partners['Dave'])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out who Dave is dancing with at the end.",
    "Based on the execution of the code, we have determined that at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Jamie. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
