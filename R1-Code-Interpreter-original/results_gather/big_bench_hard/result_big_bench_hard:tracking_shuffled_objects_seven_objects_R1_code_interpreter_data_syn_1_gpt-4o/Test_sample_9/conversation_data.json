  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Melissa, Bob is dancing with Lola, Claire is dancing with Patrick, Dave is dancing with Sam, Eve is dancing with Izzi, Fred is dancing with Helga, and Gertrude is dancing with Rodrigo.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Fred and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Claire and Fred switch partners. Then, Dave and Alice switch partners. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners. Then, Dave and Gertrude switch partners. Finally, Alice and Dave switch partners. At the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Melissa\n(B) Lola\n(C) Patrick\n(D) Sam\n(E) Izzi\n(F) Helga\n(G) Rodrigo\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. We start with the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence to determine who Dave is dancing with at the end.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Melissa\n- Bob with Lola\n- Claire with Patrick\n- Dave with Sam\n- Eve with Izzi\n- Fred with Helga\n- Gertrude with Rodrigo\n\nLet's go through the partner switches:\n\n1. Fred and Gertrude switch partners:\n   - Fred with Rodrigo\n   - Gertrude with Helga\n\n2. Claire and Fred switch partners:\n   - Claire with Rodrigo\n   - Fred with Patrick\n\n3. Dave and Alice switch partners:\n   - Dave with Melissa\n   - Alice with Sam\n\n4. Alice and Bob switch partners:\n   - Alice with Lola\n   - Bob with Sam\n\n5. Gertrude and Eve switch partners:\n   - Gertrude with Izzi\n   - Eve with Helga\n\n6. Dave and Gertrude switch partners:\n   - Dave with Izzi\n   - Gertrude with Melissa\n\n7. Alice and Dave switch partners:\n   - Alice with Izzi\n   - Dave with Lola\n\nAfter all the switches, Dave is dancing with Lola. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) Lola.\n\n<<<B) Lola>>>"
