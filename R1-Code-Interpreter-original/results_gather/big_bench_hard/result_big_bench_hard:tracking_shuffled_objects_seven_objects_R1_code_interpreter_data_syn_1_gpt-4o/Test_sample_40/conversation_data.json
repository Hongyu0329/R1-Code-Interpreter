  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Izzi, Bob is dancing with Melissa, Claire is dancing with Jamie, Dave is dancing with Rodrigo, Eve is dancing with Sam, Fred is dancing with Karl, and Gertrude is dancing with Lola.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Dave and Claire switch partners. Then, Claire and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Dave and Bob switch partners. Then, Fred and Eve switch partners. Then, Dave and Fred switch partners. Then, Claire and Fred switch partners. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Izzi\n(B) Melissa\n(C) Jamie\n(D) Rodrigo\n(E) Sam\n(F) Karl\n(G) Lola\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. We will start with the initial pairings and apply each switch in sequence to determine who Alice is dancing with at the end.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice - Izzi\n- Bob - Melissa\n- Claire - Jamie\n- Dave - Rodrigo\n- Eve - Sam\n- Fred - Karl\n- Gertrude - Lola\n\nLet's apply the partner switches:\n\n1. Dave and Claire switch partners:\n   - Dave - Jamie\n   - Claire - Rodrigo\n\n2. Claire and Gertrude switch partners:\n   - Claire - Lola\n   - Gertrude - Rodrigo\n\n3. Dave and Bob switch partners:\n   - Dave - Melissa\n   - Bob - Jamie\n\n4. Fred and Eve switch partners:\n   - Fred - Sam\n   - Eve - Karl\n\n5. Dave and Fred switch partners:\n   - Dave - Sam\n   - Fred - Melissa\n\n6. Claire and Fred switch partners:\n   - Claire - Melissa\n   - Fred - Lola\n\n7. Alice and Bob switch partners:\n   - Alice - Jamie\n   - Bob - Izzi\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this process and confirm the final partner of Alice.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    \"Alice\": \"Izzi\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Melissa\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Jamie\",\n    \"Dave\": \"Rodrigo\",\n    \"Eve\": \"Sam\",\n    \"Fred\": \"Karl\",\n    \"Gertrude\": \"Lola\"\n}\n\n# List of switches\nswitches = [\n    (\"Dave\", \"Claire\"),\n    (\"Claire\", \"Gertrude\"),\n    (\"Dave\", \"Bob\"),\n    (\"Fred\", \"Eve\"),\n    (\"Dave\", \"Fred\"),\n    (\"Claire\", \"Fred\"),\n    (\"Alice\", \"Bob\")\n]\n\n# Apply each switch\nfor dancer1, dancer2 in switches:\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Output the final partner of Alice\nprint(partners[\"Alice\"])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out who Alice is dancing with at the end.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the partner switches, Alice is dancing with Jamie. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) Jamie>>>"
