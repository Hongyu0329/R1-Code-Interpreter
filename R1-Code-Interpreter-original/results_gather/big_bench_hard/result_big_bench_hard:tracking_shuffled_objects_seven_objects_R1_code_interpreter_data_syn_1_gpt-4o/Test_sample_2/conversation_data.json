  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Melissa, Bob is dancing with Ophelia, Claire is dancing with Patrick, Dave is dancing with Jamie, Eve is dancing with Lola, Fred is dancing with Helga, and Gertrude is dancing with Izzi.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Alice and Fred switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Alice switch partners. Then, Bob and Alice switch partners. Then, Dave and Fred switch partners. Then, Eve and Alice switch partners. Finally, Eve and Claire switch partners. At the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Melissa\n(B) Ophelia\n(C) Patrick\n(D) Jamie\n(E) Lola\n(F) Helga\n(G) Izzi\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes throughout the dance. We start with the initial pairings and apply each switch in sequence to determine who Gertrude is dancing with at the end.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Melissa\n- Bob with Ophelia\n- Claire with Patrick\n- Dave with Jamie\n- Eve with Lola\n- Fred with Helga\n- Gertrude with Izzi\n\nLet's apply the partner switches step by step:\n\n1. Alice and Fred switch partners:\n   - Alice with Helga\n   - Fred with Melissa\n\n2. Gertrude and Eve switch partners:\n   - Gertrude with Lola\n   - Eve with Izzi\n\n3. Gertrude and Alice switch partners:\n   - Gertrude with Helga\n   - Alice with Lola\n\n4. Bob and Alice switch partners:\n   - Bob with Lola\n   - Alice with Ophelia\n\n5. Dave and Fred switch partners:\n   - Dave with Melissa\n   - Fred with Jamie\n\n6. Eve and Alice switch partners:\n   - Eve with Ophelia\n   - Alice with Izzi\n\n7. Eve and Claire switch partners:\n   - Eve with Patrick\n   - Claire with Ophelia\n\nNow, let's determine who Gertrude is dancing with at the end. We'll use a Python script to track these changes efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Melissa',\n    'Bob': 'Ophelia',\n    'Claire': 'Patrick',\n    'Dave': 'Jamie',\n    'Eve': 'Lola',\n    'Fred': 'Helga',\n    'Gertrude': 'Izzi'\n}\n\n# List of switches\nswitches = [\n    ('Alice', 'Fred'),\n    ('Gertrude', 'Eve'),\n    ('Gertrude', 'Alice'),\n    ('Bob', 'Alice'),\n    ('Dave', 'Fred'),\n    ('Eve', 'Alice'),\n    ('Eve', 'Claire')\n]\n\n# Apply each switch\nfor dancer1, dancer2 in switches:\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Output the final partner of Gertrude\nprint(partners['Gertrude'])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out who Gertrude is dancing with at the end.",
    "The code execution shows that at the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with Helga. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<F) Helga>>>"
