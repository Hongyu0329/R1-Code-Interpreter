  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Patrick, Bob is dancing with Rodrigo, Claire is dancing with Lola, Dave is dancing with Izzi, Eve is dancing with Sam, Fred is dancing with Karl, and Gertrude is dancing with Melissa.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Bob and Fred switch partners. Then, Claire and Alice switch partners. Then, Claire and Dave switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Alice switch partners. Then, Claire and Bob switch partners. Then, Dave and Fred switch partners. Finally, Eve and Alice switch partners. At the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Patrick\n(B) Rodrigo\n(C) Lola\n(D) Izzi\n(E) Sam\n(F) Karl\n(G) Melissa\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes throughout the dance. We will start by setting up the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence to determine who Eve is dancing with at the end.\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice - Patrick\n   - Bob - Rodrigo\n   - Claire - Lola\n   - Dave - Izzi\n   - Eve - Sam\n   - Fred - Karl\n   - Gertrude - Melissa\n\n2. **Switches:**\n   - Bob and Fred switch partners.\n   - Claire and Alice switch partners.\n   - Claire and Dave switch partners.\n   - Gertrude and Alice switch partners.\n   - Claire and Bob switch partners.\n   - Dave and Fred switch partners.\n   - Eve and Alice switch partners.\n\nWe will simulate these switches using a dictionary to keep track of the current partners and update it according to the switches.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate this process and find out who Eve is dancing with at the end.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Patrick',\n    'Bob': 'Rodrigo',\n    'Claire': 'Lola',\n    'Dave': 'Izzi',\n    'Eve': 'Sam',\n    'Fred': 'Karl',\n    'Gertrude': 'Melissa'\n}\n\n# Function to switch partners\ndef switch(partners, dancer1, dancer2):\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Apply the switches\nswitch(partners, 'Bob', 'Fred')\nswitch(partners, 'Claire', 'Alice')\nswitch(partners, 'Claire', 'Dave')\nswitch(partners, 'Gertrude', 'Alice')\nswitch(partners, 'Claire', 'Bob')\nswitch(partners, 'Dave', 'Fred')\nswitch(partners, 'Eve', 'Alice')\n\n# Output the partner of Eve\nprint(partners['Eve'])\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of partner switches and output the final partner of Eve. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that at the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with Melissa. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Melissa>>>"
