  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Melissa, Bob is dancing with Lola, Claire is dancing with Patrick, Dave is dancing with Sam, Eve is dancing with Izzi, Fred is dancing with Helga, and Gertrude is dancing with Rodrigo.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Fred and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Claire and Fred switch partners. Then, Dave and Alice switch partners. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners. Then, Dave and Gertrude switch partners. Finally, Alice and Dave switch partners. At the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Melissa\n(B) Lola\n(C) Patrick\n(D) Sam\n(E) Izzi\n(F) Helga\n(G) Rodrigo\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes throughout the dance. We will start by setting up the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence to determine the final partner of Eve.\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice - Melissa\n   - Bob - Lola\n   - Claire - Patrick\n   - Dave - Sam\n   - Eve - Izzi\n   - Fred - Helga\n   - Gertrude - Rodrigo\n\n2. **Switches:**\n   - Fred and Gertrude switch partners.\n   - Claire and Fred switch partners.\n   - Dave and Alice switch partners.\n   - Alice and Bob switch partners.\n   - Gertrude and Eve switch partners.\n   - Dave and Gertrude switch partners.\n   - Alice and Dave switch partners.\n\nWe will simulate these switches using a dictionary to keep track of the current partners and update it according to the switches.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate this process and find out who Eve is dancing with at the end.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Melissa',\n    'Bob': 'Lola',\n    'Claire': 'Patrick',\n    'Dave': 'Sam',\n    'Eve': 'Izzi',\n    'Fred': 'Helga',\n    'Gertrude': 'Rodrigo'\n}\n\n# Function to switch partners\ndef switch(partners, dancer1, dancer2):\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Apply the switches\nswitch(partners, 'Fred', 'Gertrude')\nswitch(partners, 'Claire', 'Fred')\nswitch(partners, 'Dave', 'Alice')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Bob')\nswitch(partners, 'Gertrude', 'Eve')\nswitch(partners, 'Dave', 'Gertrude')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Dave')\n\n# Output the final partner of Eve\nprint(partners['Eve'])\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of partner switches and print the final partner of Eve. Let's run the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final partner of Eve is Helga. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<F) Helga>>>"
