    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as they are swapped among the friends. We will start by assigning each person their initial book and then simulate each swap in the order given. Finally, we will check which book Fred has at the end.\n\nLet's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. Initial assignment:\n   - Alice: The Pearl\n   - Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring\n   - Claire: Catch-22\n   - Dave: The Great Gatsby\n   - Eve: Frankenstein\n   - Fred: Ulysses\n   - Gertrude: The Odyssey\n\n2. Swaps:\n   - Gertrude and Bob swap books.\n   - Alice and Fred swap books.\n   - Gertrude and Claire swap books.\n   - Fred and Eve swap books.\n   - Claire and Dave swap books.\n   - Eve and Bob swap books.\n   - Fred and Gertrude swap books.\n\nWe will write a Python script to simulate these swaps and determine which book Fred has at the end.\n\n```python\n# Initial book assignment\nbooks = {\n    \"Alice\": \"The Pearl\",\n    \"Bob\": \"The Fellowship of the Ring\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Catch-22\",\n    \"Dave\": \"The Great Gatsby\",\n    \"Eve\": \"Frankenstein\",\n    \"Fred\": \"Ulysses\",\n    \"Gertrude\": \"The Odyssey\"\n}\n\n# Perform the swaps\n# Gertrude and Bob swap books\nbooks[\"Gertrude\"], books[\"Bob\"] = books[\"Bob\"], books[\"Gertrude\"]\n\n# Alice and Fred swap books\nbooks[\"Alice\"], books[\"Fred\"] = books[\"Fred\"], books[\"Alice\"]\n\n# Gertrude and Claire swap books\nbooks[\"Gertrude\"], books[\"Claire\"] = books[\"Claire\"], books[\"Gertrude\"]\n\n# Fred and Eve swap books\nbooks[\"Fred\"], books[\"Eve\"] = books[\"Eve\"], books[\"Fred\"]\n\n# Claire and Dave swap books\nbooks[\"Claire\"], books[\"Dave\"] = books[\"Dave\"], books[\"Claire\"]\n\n# Eve and Bob swap books\nbooks[\"Eve\"], books[\"Bob\"] = books[\"Bob\"], books[\"Eve\"]\n\n# Fred and Gertrude swap books\nbooks[\"Fred\"], books[\"Gertrude\"] = books[\"Gertrude\"], books[\"Fred\"]\n\n# Output the book Fred has at the end\nprint(books[\"Fred\"])\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find out which book Fred has at the end.",
    "Based on the code execution, Fred ends up with the book \"Catch-22\" at the end of the semester after all the swaps have been completed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
