  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Izzi, Bob is dancing with Jamie, Claire is dancing with Ophelia, Dave is dancing with Rodrigo, Eve is dancing with Patrick, Fred is dancing with Sam, and Gertrude is dancing with Lola.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Eve and Claire switch partners. Then, Fred and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Eve and Bob switch partners. Then, Eve and Alice switch partners. Then, Dave and Bob switch partners. Then, Dave and Eve switch partners. Finally, Alice and Dave switch partners. At the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Izzi\n(B) Jamie\n(C) Ophelia\n(D) Rodrigo\n(E) Patrick\n(F) Sam\n(G) Lola\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes throughout the dance. We start with the initial pairings and apply each switch in sequence. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice - Izzi\n   - Bob - Jamie\n   - Claire - Ophelia\n   - Dave - Rodrigo\n   - Eve - Patrick\n   - Fred - Sam\n   - Gertrude - Lola\n\n2. **Switches:**\n   - Eve and Claire switch partners: \n     - Eve - Ophelia\n     - Claire - Patrick\n   - Fred and Gertrude switch partners:\n     - Fred - Lola\n     - Gertrude - Sam\n   - Eve and Bob switch partners:\n     - Eve - Jamie\n     - Bob - Ophelia\n   - Eve and Alice switch partners:\n     - Eve - Izzi\n     - Alice - Jamie\n   - Dave and Bob switch partners:\n     - Dave - Ophelia\n     - Bob - Rodrigo\n   - Dave and Eve switch partners:\n     - Dave - Izzi\n     - Eve - Ophelia\n   - Alice and Dave switch partners:\n     - Alice - Izzi\n     - Dave - Jamie\n\nNow, we need to determine who Gertrude is dancing with at the end. Let's implement this in Python to track the changes efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Izzi',\n    'Bob': 'Jamie',\n    'Claire': 'Ophelia',\n    'Dave': 'Rodrigo',\n    'Eve': 'Patrick',\n    'Fred': 'Sam',\n    'Gertrude': 'Lola'\n}\n\n# Function to switch partners\ndef switch(partners, dancer1, dancer2):\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Apply the switches\nswitch(partners, 'Eve', 'Claire')\nswitch(partners, 'Fred', 'Gertrude')\nswitch(partners, 'Eve', 'Bob')\nswitch(partners, 'Eve', 'Alice')\nswitch(partners, 'Dave', 'Bob')\nswitch(partners, 'Dave', 'Eve')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Dave')\n\n# Find Gertrude's partner\ngertrude_partner = partners['Gertrude']\nprint(gertrude_partner)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out who Gertrude is dancing with at the end.",
    "The code execution shows that at the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with Sam. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
