    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as they are swapped among the friends. We will start by assigning each person their initial book and then simulate each swap in the order given. Finally, we will check which book Gertrude has at the end.\n\nLet's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. Initial assignment:\n   - Alice: The Odyssey\n   - Bob: The Great Gatsby\n   - Claire: Lolita\n   - Dave: The Pearl\n   - Eve: The Fellowship of the Ring\n   - Fred: Frankenstein\n   - Gertrude: Hound of the Baskervilles\n\n2. Swaps:\n   - Claire and Bob swap books.\n   - Alice and Dave swap books.\n   - Gertrude and Fred swap books.\n   - Bob and Alice swap books.\n   - Alice and Eve swap books.\n   - Dave and Gertrude swap books.\n   - Dave and Eve swap books.\n\nWe will write a Python script to simulate these swaps and determine which book Gertrude has at the end.\n\n```python\n# Initial book assignments\nbooks = {\n    \"Alice\": \"The Odyssey\",\n    \"Bob\": \"The Great Gatsby\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Lolita\",\n    \"Dave\": \"The Pearl\",\n    \"Eve\": \"The Fellowship of the Ring\",\n    \"Fred\": \"Frankenstein\",\n    \"Gertrude\": \"Hound of the Baskervilles\"\n}\n\n# Perform the swaps\n# Claire and Bob swap books\nbooks[\"Claire\"], books[\"Bob\"] = books[\"Bob\"], books[\"Claire\"]\n\n# Alice and Dave swap books\nbooks[\"Alice\"], books[\"Dave\"] = books[\"Dave\"], books[\"Alice\"]\n\n# Gertrude and Fred swap books\nbooks[\"Gertrude\"], books[\"Fred\"] = books[\"Fred\"], books[\"Gertrude\"]\n\n# Bob and Alice swap books\nbooks[\"Bob\"], books[\"Alice\"] = books[\"Alice\"], books[\"Bob\"]\n\n# Alice and Eve swap books\nbooks[\"Alice\"], books[\"Eve\"] = books[\"Eve\"], books[\"Alice\"]\n\n# Dave and Gertrude swap books\nbooks[\"Dave\"], books[\"Gertrude\"] = books[\"Gertrude\"], books[\"Dave\"]\n\n# Dave and Eve swap books\nbooks[\"Dave\"], books[\"Eve\"] = books[\"Eve\"], books[\"Dave\"]\n\n# Output the book Gertrude has at the end\nprint(books[\"Gertrude\"])\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find out which book Gertrude has at the end.",
    "Based on the code execution, Gertrude ends up with \"The Odyssey\" at the end of the semester after all the swaps. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
