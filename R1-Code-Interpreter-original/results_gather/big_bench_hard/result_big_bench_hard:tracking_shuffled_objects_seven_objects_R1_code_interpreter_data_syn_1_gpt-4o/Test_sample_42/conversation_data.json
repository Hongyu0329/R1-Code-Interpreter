At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a pink ball, Bob has a red present, Claire has a blue present, Dave has a brown present, Eve has a yellow present, Fred has a white present, and Gertrude has a black ball.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Alice and Claire swap their gifts. Then, Dave and Bob swap their gifts. Then, Alice and Gertrude swap their gifts. Then, Claire and Gertrude swap their gifts.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges and determine which gift Alice ends up with at the end of the event. Let's go through the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Pink\n   - Bob: Red\n   - Claire: Blue\n   - Dave: Brown\n   - Eve: Yellow\n   - Fred: White\n   - Gertrude: Black\n\n2. **Swaps:**\n   - **Alice and Claire swap:** \n     - Alice: Blue\n     - Claire: Pink\n   - **Dave and Bob swap:** \n     - Dave: Red\n     - Bob: Brown\n   - **Alice and Gertrude swap:** \n     - Alice: Black\n     - Gertrude: Blue\n   - **Claire and Gertrude swap:** \n     - Claire: Blue\n     - Gertrude: Pink\n   - **Alice and Eve swap:** \n     - Alice: Yellow\n     - Eve: Black\n   - **Fred and Dave swap:** \n     - Fred: Red\n     - Dave: White\n   - **Claire and Alice swap:** \n     - Claire: Yellow\n     - Alice: Blue\n\nAfter performing all the swaps, Alice ends up with the blue present. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) blue present>>>"
