  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Patrick, Bob is dancing with Lola, Claire is dancing with Izzi, Dave is dancing with Rodrigo, Eve is dancing with Helga, Fred is dancing with Sam, and Gertrude is dancing with Melissa.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Eve and Bob switch partners. Then, Eve and Dave switch partners. Then, Fred and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Alice switch partners. Then, Alice and Dave switch partners. Then, Claire and Alice switch partners. Finally, Alice and Dave switch partners. At the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Patrick\n(B) Lola\n(C) Izzi\n(D) Rodrigo\n(E) Helga\n(F) Sam\n(G) Melissa\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes throughout the dance. We will start by setting up the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence to determine who Eve is dancing with at the end.\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice with Patrick\n   - Bob with Lola\n   - Claire with Izzi\n   - Dave with Rodrigo\n   - Eve with Helga\n   - Fred with Sam\n   - Gertrude with Melissa\n\n2. **Switches:**\n   - Eve and Bob switch partners.\n   - Eve and Dave switch partners.\n   - Fred and Gertrude switch partners.\n   - Gertrude and Alice switch partners.\n   - Alice and Dave switch partners.\n   - Claire and Alice switch partners.\n   - Alice and Dave switch partners.\n\nWe will simulate these switches using a dictionary to keep track of the current partners.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Patrick',\n    'Bob': 'Lola',\n    'Claire': 'Izzi',\n    'Dave': 'Rodrigo',\n    'Eve': 'Helga',\n    'Fred': 'Sam',\n    'Gertrude': 'Melissa'\n}\n\n# Function to switch partners\ndef switch(partners, dancer1, dancer2):\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Apply the switches\nswitch(partners, 'Eve', 'Bob')\nswitch(partners, 'Eve', 'Dave')\nswitch(partners, 'Fred', 'Gertrude')\nswitch(partners, 'Gertrude', 'Alice')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Dave')\nswitch(partners, 'Claire', 'Alice')\nswitch(partners, 'Alice', 'Dave')\n\n# Output the final partner of Eve\nprint(partners['Eve'])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out who Eve is dancing with at the end.",
    "The code execution shows that at the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with Rodrigo. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Rodrigo>>>"
