    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as they are swapped among the friends. We will simulate each swap step-by-step to determine which book Eve ends up with at the end of the semester.\n\nLet's start by setting up the initial ownership of the books:\n\n- Alice: Lolita\n- Bob: Frankenstein\n- Claire: Moby Dick\n- Dave: The Pearl\n- Eve: Hound of the Baskervilles\n- Fred: The Fellowship of the Ring\n- Gertrude: The Odyssey\n\nNow, let's simulate the swaps:\n\n1. Dave and Gertrude swap books.\n2. Claire and Bob swap books.\n3. Alice and Dave swap books.\n4. Fred and Claire swap books.\n5. Dave and Fred swap books.\n6. Bob and Claire swap books.\n7. Eve and Fred swap books.\n\nWe will write a Python script to simulate these swaps and determine the final book that Eve has.\n\n```python\n# Initial book ownership\nbooks = {\n    \"Alice\": \"Lolita\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Frankenstein\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Moby Dick\",\n    \"Dave\": \"The Pearl\",\n    \"Eve\": \"Hound of the Baskervilles\",\n    \"Fred\": \"The Fellowship of the Ring\",\n    \"Gertrude\": \"The Odyssey\"\n}\n\n# Perform the swaps\n# 1. Dave and Gertrude swap books\nbooks[\"Dave\"], books[\"Gertrude\"] = books[\"Gertrude\"], books[\"Dave\"]\n\n# 2. Claire and Bob swap books\nbooks[\"Claire\"], books[\"Bob\"] = books[\"Bob\"], books[\"Claire\"]\n\n# 3. Alice and Dave swap books\nbooks[\"Alice\"], books[\"Dave\"] = books[\"Dave\"], books[\"Alice\"]\n\n# 4. Fred and Claire swap books\nbooks[\"Fred\"], books[\"Claire\"] = books[\"Claire\"], books[\"Fred\"]\n\n# 5. Dave and Fred swap books\nbooks[\"Dave\"], books[\"Fred\"] = books[\"Fred\"], books[\"Dave\"]\n\n# 6. Bob and Claire swap books\nbooks[\"Bob\"], books[\"Claire\"] = books[\"Claire\"], books[\"Bob\"]\n\n# 7. Eve and Fred swap books\nbooks[\"Eve\"], books[\"Fred\"] = books[\"Fred\"], books[\"Eve\"]\n\n# Output the book Eve has at the end\nprint(books[\"Eve\"])\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find out which book Eve has at the end of the semester.",
    "Based on the simulation of the book swaps, Eve ends up with the book \"Lolita\" at the end of the semester.\n\n<<<A>>>"
