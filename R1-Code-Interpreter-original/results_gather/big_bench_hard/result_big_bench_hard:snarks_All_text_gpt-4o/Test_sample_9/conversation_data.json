    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Statement: \"He's over six feet, so he must be tall.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: If someone is over six feet tall, they are generally considered tall.\n   - Implied Meaning: This statement is straightforward and factual. There is no contradiction or irony in saying someone over six feet is tall. \n   - Conclusion: This statement is not sarcastic because it aligns with the literal meaning.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Statement: \"He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: Being over six feet tall is directly linked to being wonderful.\n   - Implied Meaning: The statement suggests that height is a determinant of someone's wonderfulness, which is an illogical and exaggerated connection. \n   - Sarcastic Element: The sarcasm lies in the absurdity of equating height with personal qualities like being wonderful. The speaker likely does not believe that height determines someone's wonderfulness and is using sarcasm to highlight the ridiculousness of such a notion.\n   - Conclusion: This statement is sarcastic because it uses irony to mock the idea that height correlates with being wonderful.\n\n4. **Final Decision**:\n   - Option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey a point that is not meant to be taken literally.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful"
