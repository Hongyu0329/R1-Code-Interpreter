    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - \"I love it when people mock other people for trying to get healthier. It's so classy.\"\n   - The phrase \"I love it\" is typically positive, but it is followed by \"when people mock other people for trying to get healthier,\" which is generally considered negative behavior. \n   - The use of \"It's so classy\" is likely ironic because mocking someone is not considered classy behavior. \n   - The contrast between the positive language (\"I love it\" and \"It's so classy\") and the negative action (mocking) suggests sarcasm.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - \"I love it when people encourage other people for trying to get healthier. It's so classy.\"\n   - Here, \"I love it\" is followed by \"when people encourage other people for trying to get healthier,\" which is a positive action.\n   - The phrase \"It's so classy\" aligns with the positive action of encouragement, suggesting sincerity rather than sarcasm.\n   - There is no contrast or irony in this statement, indicating it is not sarcastic.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (A) is sarcastic because it uses positive language to describe a negative action, creating irony. Option (B) is sincere because the positive language matches the positive action.\n\n<<<A>>>"
