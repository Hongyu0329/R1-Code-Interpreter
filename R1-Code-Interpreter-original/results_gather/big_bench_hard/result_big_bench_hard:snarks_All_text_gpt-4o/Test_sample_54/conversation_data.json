    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to understand the context and typical usage of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one actually means, usually in a mocking or ironic way. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1. **Option (A): \"We all know diamonds are worthless\"**\n   - **Literal Meaning**: This statement suggests that diamonds have no value.\n   - **Common Knowledge**: In reality, diamonds are widely considered valuable due to their rarity, desirability, and the marketing efforts of the diamond industry.\n   - **Sarcastic Interpretation**: Given that diamonds are generally known to be valuable, saying they are \"worthless\" could be sarcastic, implying the opposite of the literal meaning.\n\n2. **Option (B): \"We all know diamonds are valuable\"**\n   - **Literal Meaning**: This statement suggests that diamonds are valuable.\n   - **Common Knowledge**: This aligns with the general perception and reality that diamonds are indeed valuable.\n   - **Sarcastic Interpretation**: There is no apparent sarcasm here, as the statement aligns with common beliefs and does not imply the opposite.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (A) is likely to be sarcastic because it contradicts the common understanding of diamonds being valuable, thus implying the opposite of its literal meaning.\n\n<<<answer>>> Option (A) We all know diamonds are worthless"
