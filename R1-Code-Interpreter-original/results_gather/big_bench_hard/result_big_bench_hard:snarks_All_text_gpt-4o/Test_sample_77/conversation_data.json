    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the language used in each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It often involves saying something positive in a tone or context that implies the opposite.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - The statement says, \"Wow. You're right. All those memes in the bitcoin sub and people posting about making money and what they're going to buy with it sure turned on people investing from in it.\"\n   - The phrase \"turned on people investing\" suggests that the memes and posts encouraged or attracted people to invest in Bitcoin.\n   - The use of \"Wow. You're right.\" could be interpreted as genuine agreement or sarcastic, depending on the context.\n   - However, the statement itself does not contain an obvious contradiction or irony. It seems to straightforwardly suggest that the memes and posts had a positive effect on investment interest.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - The statement says, \"Wow. You're right. All those memes in the bitcoin sub and people posting about making money and what they're going to buy with it sure turned off people investing from in it.\"\n   - The phrase \"turned off people investing\" suggests that the memes and posts discouraged or repelled people from investing in Bitcoin.\n   - Here, the use of \"Wow. You're right.\" followed by a statement that contradicts the expected outcome (i.e., that positive posts would attract investors) indicates sarcasm. The speaker is likely mocking the idea that such posts would have a negative effect on investment interest.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (B) contains a contradiction between the expected effect of positive posts about making money and the stated effect of turning people off from investing. This contradiction, combined with the initial phrase \"Wow. You're right,\" suggests a sarcastic tone.\n   - Option (A) lacks this contradiction and does not clearly convey sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is sarcastic is Option (B).\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
