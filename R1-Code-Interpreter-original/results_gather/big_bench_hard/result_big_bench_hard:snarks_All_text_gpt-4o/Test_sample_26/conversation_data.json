    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It often involves exaggeration or contradiction.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - \"You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the elephants, that woefully endangered species.\"\n   - Elephants are indeed an endangered species, and feeding them could be seen as a positive action. The statement does not contain any obvious contradiction or exaggeration that would indicate sarcasm. It seems sincere and straightforward.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - \"You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species.\"\n   - The term \"trolls\" in modern language often refers to people who deliberately provoke others online. They are not an endangered species, and the idea of \"feeding\" them is usually discouraged, as it means giving them attention. The phrase \"woefully endangered species\" is used sarcastically here because trolls are not endangered, and the speaker is likely mocking the idea of giving them attention.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (B) contains a contradiction and exaggeration that is characteristic of sarcasm. The speaker is likely not genuinely glad to \"feed the trolls,\" and the description of trolls as an \"endangered species\" is ironic.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
