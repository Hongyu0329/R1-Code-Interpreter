    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually for humorous or emphatic effect. It often relies on context and tone, which can be challenging to discern in written text without additional cues.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) \"He's such terrible relationship material when he's drunk.\"\n- This statement is straightforward and likely not sarcastic. It directly states that the person is not suitable for a relationship when drunk, which could be a genuine observation.\n\n(B) \"He's such great relationship material when he's drunk.\"\n- This statement is more likely to be sarcastic. Typically, being drunk is associated with impaired judgment and behavior, which are not qualities that make someone \"great relationship material.\" Therefore, saying someone is \"great relationship material\" when drunk could be intended sarcastically, implying the opposite.\n\nConsidering the typical use of sarcasm and the context provided by the statements, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) He's such great relationship material when he's drunk"
