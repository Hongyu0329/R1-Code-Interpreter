    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what one actually means, usually in a mocking or ironic way. It often highlights a discrepancy between what is expected and what is reality.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - \"Welp, my $1000 dollar phone has bad battery life, guess I'll just have to return it.\"\n   - This statement suggests that the speaker is considering returning the phone due to its poor battery life. \n   - Returning a product with a defect is a logical and expected action. There is no irony or unexpected element here, so this statement is likely not sarcastic.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - \"Welp, my $1000 dollar phone has bad battery life, guess I'll just have to dumpster it.\"\n   - This statement suggests that the speaker is considering throwing away a $1000 phone because of its bad battery life.\n   - Throwing away an expensive phone due to a fixable issue like battery life is an illogical and unexpected action. The exaggeration and absurdity of the action imply sarcasm, as the speaker likely does not intend to literally throw the phone away.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (B) is sarcastic because it uses exaggeration and an illogical action to highlight the frustration with the phone's battery life, implying that the speaker is not actually going to throw the phone away.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
