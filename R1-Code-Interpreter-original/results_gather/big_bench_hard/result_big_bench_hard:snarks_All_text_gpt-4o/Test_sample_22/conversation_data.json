    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A): \"You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't unfamiliar for you?\"**\n   - The phrase \"isn't unfamiliar\" is a double negative, which means \"is familiar.\"\n   - The speaker is suggesting that the listener is familiar with Knuth up arrow notation.\n   - The use of \"isn't unfamiliar\" could imply that the speaker is surprised or skeptical about the listener's familiarity, which can be sarcastic if the speaker actually believes the listener is not familiar with it.\n\n2. **Option (B): \"You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you?\"**\n   - The phrase \"isn't normal\" suggests that the notation is not usual or typical for the listener.\n   - The speaker is implying that the listener finds Knuth up arrow notation unusual.\n   - This statement does not inherently carry a sarcastic tone, as it straightforwardly questions the listener's familiarity without irony or mockery.\n\nConsidering the analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses a double negative in a way that could imply disbelief or irony about the listener's familiarity with a complex mathematical notation. Option (B) lacks the ironic or mocking tone typically associated with sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't unfamiliar for you?"
