    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the underlying meaning of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - Statement: \"It's not our job to fund education! It should be the government paying the maintenance to keep schools open.\"\n   - Analysis: This statement suggests that the responsibility of funding education should fall on the government, which is a common and reasonable expectation. There is no apparent irony or contradiction in this statement, as it aligns with the general belief that governments are responsible for public education funding.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - Statement: \"It's not our job to fund education! It should be the kids paying the maintenance to keep schools open.\"\n   - Analysis: This statement suggests that children should be responsible for paying to keep schools open, which is an unreasonable and absurd expectation. The idea of children funding their own education is contrary to societal norms and expectations, making it ironic and likely sarcastic. The speaker is likely using sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of shifting the financial burden of education onto children.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is the statement that is sarcastic because it uses irony to emphasize the absurdity of the suggestion that children should fund their own education.\n\n<<<B>>>"
