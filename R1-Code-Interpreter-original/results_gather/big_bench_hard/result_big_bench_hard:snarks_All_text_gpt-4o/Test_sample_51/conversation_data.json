    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and implied meaning of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Oh, it's not happened before? I guess it must not be in the lawbooks then\"\n   - The speaker is responding to the idea that something hasn't happened before.\n   - The phrase \"I guess it must not be in the lawbooks then\" implies that if something hasn't happened, it wouldn't be documented or recognized legally.\n   - This statement could be sarcastic because it suggests that just because something hasn't happened, it doesn't mean it isn't recognized by law. The speaker might be mocking the idea that the absence of precedent means the absence of legal recognition.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Oh, it's not happened before? I guess it must not be against the lawbooks then\"\n   - Similar to option (A), the speaker is responding to the idea that something hasn't happened before.\n   - The phrase \"I guess it must not be against the lawbooks then\" implies that if something hasn't happened, it wouldn't be illegal.\n   - This statement is likely sarcastic because it mocks the notion that the absence of occurrence equates to legality. The speaker is likely implying that just because something hasn't happened doesn't mean it isn't illegal.\n\nBoth statements use a similar structure and tone, but the key difference lies in the implications:\n- Option (A) suggests that if something hasn't happened, it wouldn't be documented in law, which is less directly mocking than option (B).\n- Option (B) directly mocks the idea that the absence of an event means it isn't illegal, which is a more common sarcastic implication.\n\nGiven these analyses, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it more directly mocks the logic of equating the absence of an event with legality.\n\n<<<B>>>"
