    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually to mock or convey contempt.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - Both statements begin with \"Yeah, I've noticed he's been...\" which suggests an observation about someone's recent behavior.\n   - Both statements end with \"what a great transformation,\" which is a positive remark about a change in behavior.\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (A):**\n   - \"Yeah, I've noticed he's been drinking every day recently, what a great transformation.\"\n   - Drinking every day is generally considered a negative behavior, associated with potential health issues or addiction.\n   - The phrase \"what a great transformation\" is positive, which contrasts with the negative connotation of drinking every day.\n   - This contrast suggests sarcasm, as the speaker likely does not genuinely believe that drinking every day is a \"great transformation.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (B):**\n   - \"Yeah, I've noticed he's been exercising every day recently, what a great transformation.\"\n   - Exercising every day is generally considered a positive behavior, associated with improved health and well-being.\n   - The phrase \"what a great transformation\" aligns with the positive connotation of exercising every day.\n   - There is no contrast here, so the statement is likely sincere and not sarcastic.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Statement (A) is sarcastic because it uses a positive phrase to describe a behavior that is typically viewed negatively, creating a contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm.\n   - Statement (B) is not sarcastic because the positive phrase aligns with the positive behavior, indicating sincerity.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
