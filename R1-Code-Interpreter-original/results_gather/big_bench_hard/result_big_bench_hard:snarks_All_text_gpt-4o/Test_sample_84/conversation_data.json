    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"People these days are so rich. Back in my day we didn't have luxuries.\"\n   - **Literal Meaning:** The speaker is suggesting that people today are wealthy and have many luxuries, whereas in the past, they did not have such luxuries.\n   - **Analysis for Sarcasm:** This statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is implying that people today are not actually rich or that the \"luxuries\" they refer to are not truly luxurious. The use of \"luxuries\" can be exaggerated to mock the perception of wealth.\n   - **Contextual Clues:** The phrase \"so rich\" can be exaggerated, and \"luxuries\" might be used to mock what is considered luxurious today compared to the past.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"People these days are so rich. Back in my day we didn't have houses.\"\n   - **Literal Meaning:** The speaker is suggesting that people today are wealthy enough to have houses, whereas in the past, they did not have houses.\n   - **Analysis for Sarcasm:** This statement is likely sarcastic because it is unrealistic to claim that people in the past did not have houses. The exaggeration of not having houses is used to mock the idea that people today are excessively rich.\n   - **Contextual Clues:** The claim of not having houses is an exaggeration and is likely intended to be humorous or mocking, as it is not a reasonable comparison.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Option (A) could be sarcastic, but it is more plausible as a literal statement if the speaker genuinely believes that people today have more luxuries.\n- Option (B) is more clearly sarcastic due to the unrealistic and exaggerated claim about not having houses in the past.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is sarcastic is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) People these days are so rich. Back in my day we didn't have houses"
