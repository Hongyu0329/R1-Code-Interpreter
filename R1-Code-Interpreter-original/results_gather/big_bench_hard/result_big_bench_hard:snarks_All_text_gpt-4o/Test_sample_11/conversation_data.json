    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical structure of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is true or expected, often in a mocking or ironic tone. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1. **Option (A): \"Yes, the game is over after the second half\"**\n   - Literal Meaning: This statement is factually correct. In most sports, a game is indeed over after the second half. There is no inherent contradiction or irony in this statement.\n   - Sarcasm Analysis: Since this statement aligns with the factual structure of a game, it lacks the typical characteristics of sarcasm, which often involves a contradiction or an unexpected twist.\n\n2. **Option (B): \"Yes, the game is over after the first half\"**\n   - Literal Meaning: This statement is factually incorrect for most sports, as games typically continue after the first half. Saying the game is over after the first half contradicts the usual structure of a game.\n   - Sarcasm Analysis: This statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is implying that the outcome of the game is already decided by halftime, perhaps due to a significant lead by one team. The sarcasm lies in the exaggeration or irony of suggesting the game is effectively over when it is not literally over.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it involves a contradiction to the expected structure of a game and could imply an ironic or exaggerated sentiment about the game's outcome.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Yes, the game is over after the first half"
