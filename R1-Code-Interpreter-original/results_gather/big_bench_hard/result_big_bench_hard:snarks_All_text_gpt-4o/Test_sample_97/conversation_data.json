    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the connotations of the words used in each option.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - Both statements reference \"Hitler,\" a historical figure known for his role as the leader of Nazi Germany and the atrocities committed during World War II, including the Holocaust.\n   - The name \"Hitler\" generally carries a negative connotation due to his association with war crimes, genocide, and totalitarian rule.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A):**\n   - \"Just like Hitler. A True warrior.\"\n   - The term \"warrior\" typically has a positive connotation, often associated with bravery, strength, and honor in battle.\n   - However, calling Hitler a \"True warrior\" could be seen as sarcastic because it contrasts with the overwhelmingly negative view of his actions and legacy. The use of \"True\" might be intended to mock or highlight the irony of calling someone with such a destructive and infamous history a \"warrior.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B):**\n   - \"Just like Hitler. A True demagogue.\"\n   - The term \"demagogue\" refers to a political leader who seeks support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument. It often has a negative connotation, suggesting manipulation and exploitation of emotions.\n   - Calling Hitler a \"True demagogue\" aligns with historical accounts of his rise to power, where he used propaganda and emotional appeal to gain support. This statement is more factual and less likely to be sarcastic because it accurately describes one of Hitler's known characteristics.\n\n4. **Determining Sarcasm:**\n   - Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.\n   - Option (A) uses a term with a generally positive connotation (\"warrior\") in a context where it is unlikely to be genuinely meant, given the negative historical view of Hitler. This contrast suggests sarcasm.\n   - Option (B) uses a term that accurately describes Hitler's known behavior, making it less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Just like Hitler. A True warrior"
