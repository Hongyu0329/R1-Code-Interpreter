    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the language used in each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - Both statements seem to refer to a situation in a sport, likely soccer (football), where a player is being judged for a foul that could result in a red card.\n   - A red card is given for serious fouls, and it results in the player being sent off the field.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A):**\n   - \"But his eyes were on the ball, shouldn't be a red.\"\n   - This statement suggests that the player was focused on the ball, implying that the foul was unintentional or not serious.\n   - The phrase \"shouldn't be a red\" suggests that the speaker believes a red card is not warranted.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B):**\n   - \"But his cleats were on the ball, shouldn't be a red.\"\n   - This statement suggests that the player's cleats (shoes) were on the ball, which could imply a dangerous play, as cleats can cause injury.\n   - The phrase \"shouldn't be a red\" here could be sarcastic because having cleats on the ball might actually be a reason for a red card, especially if it was a reckless or dangerous play.\n\n4. **Identifying Sarcasm:**\n   - In Option (A), the statement seems straightforward and not sarcastic. It argues that the player was focused on the ball, which is typically a defense against a foul.\n   - In Option (B), the statement could be sarcastic because having cleats on the ball might be a reason for a red card, yet the speaker is saying it shouldn't be. This contradiction suggests sarcasm.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents a situation (cleats on the ball) that could justify a red card, yet the speaker dismisses it, which is ironic.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) But his cleats were on the ball, shouldn't be a red"
