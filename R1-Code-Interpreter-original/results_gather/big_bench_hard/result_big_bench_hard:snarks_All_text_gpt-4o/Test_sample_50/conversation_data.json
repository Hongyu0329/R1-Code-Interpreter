    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the literal meaning of each statement.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It usually relies on context and tone, which can be challenging to convey in written form without additional cues.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Statement: \"Impossible, as there's no one on the internet.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: This statement suggests that there are no people on the internet.\n   - Reality: The internet is a global network with billions of users. The statement is factually incorrect.\n   - Sarcasm Potential: Given the widespread use of the internet, saying there is \"no one\" on it is likely intended to be sarcastic, implying the opposite of the literal meaning.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Statement: \"Impossible, as there's no one on the Moon.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: This statement suggests that there are no people currently on the Moon.\n   - Reality: As of now, there are indeed no people living on the Moon. The last manned mission to the Moon was in 1972 (Apollo 17), and no humans have been there since.\n   - Sarcasm Potential: This statement is factually correct, as there are indeed no people on the Moon. It does not carry the same ironic contradiction as Option (A).\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Option (A) contradicts reality in a way that suggests sarcasm, as it implies the opposite of the truth.\n   - Option (B) aligns with reality and does not exhibit the typical characteristics of sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
