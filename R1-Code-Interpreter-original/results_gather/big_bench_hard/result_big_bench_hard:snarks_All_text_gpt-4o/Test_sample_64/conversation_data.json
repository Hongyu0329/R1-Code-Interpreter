    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\n2. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The White House is a highly secure building in real life, equipped with numerous security measures, including security cameras.\n   - A statement that contradicts this reality, especially in a way that seems to mock or highlight the absurdity, is likely to be sarcastic.\n\n3. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **Option (A)**: \"Of course there's no security cameras in the White House in the game, they said it's just like real life!\"\n     - This statement suggests that the game lacks security cameras in the White House, which is contrary to the real-life situation where the White House is heavily monitored.\n     - The phrase \"just like real life\" is used ironically here, as the absence of security cameras is not like real life at all. This contradiction indicates sarcasm.\n   \n   - **Option (B)**: \"Of course there's several security cameras in the White House in the game, they said it's just like real life!\"\n     - This statement aligns with the real-life situation where the White House does have several security cameras.\n     - There is no contradiction or irony in this statement, so it is not sarcastic.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (A) is sarcastic because it uses irony to highlight the absurdity of a game feature that contradicts real-life expectations.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
