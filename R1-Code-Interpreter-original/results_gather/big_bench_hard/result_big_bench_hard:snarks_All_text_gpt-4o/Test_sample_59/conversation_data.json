    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. Let's examine each statement:\n\n1. **Option (A): \"It's cultural celebration at its finest!\"**\n   - **Literal Interpretation**: This statement suggests that the event or situation being described is an excellent example of cultural celebration.\n   - **Tone**: The phrase \"at its finest\" is typically used to express genuine admiration or approval.\n   - **Potential for Sarcasm**: If the context involves genuine cultural celebration, this statement is likely sincere. However, if the context involves a situation where cultural elements are being misused or disrespected, this could be sarcastic.\n\n2. **Option (B): \"It's cultural appropriation at its finest!\"**\n   - **Literal Interpretation**: This statement suggests that the event or situation is an excellent example of cultural appropriation.\n   - **Tone**: Cultural appropriation is generally viewed negatively, as it involves taking elements from a culture without permission or understanding, often leading to disrespect or exploitation.\n   - **Potential for Sarcasm**: The phrase \"at its finest\" is typically positive, but when paired with a negative concept like cultural appropriation, it creates a contrast that is often used sarcastically. The speaker might be highlighting the egregiousness of the appropriation by ironically calling it \"the finest.\"\n\n**Conclusion**: Given the negative connotation of cultural appropriation and the positive phrase \"at its finest,\" Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic. The speaker is likely using irony to criticize the situation.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) It's cultural appropriation at its finest!"
