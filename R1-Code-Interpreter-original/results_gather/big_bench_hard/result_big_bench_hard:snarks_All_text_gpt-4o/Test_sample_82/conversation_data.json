    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way, to convey contempt or humor.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) \"You didn't realize that bikes are a stationary object?\"\n- This statement suggests that bikes are stationary, which is factually incorrect because bikes are meant for movement. The statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is mocking someone for not understanding that bikes are not stationary.\n\n(B) \"You didn't realize that bikes aren't a stationary object?\"\n- This statement is factually correct because bikes are not stationary objects; they are designed for movement. The statement is straightforward and does not carry an ironic or mocking tone.\n\nCareful Points:\n1. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is the opposite of the truth or what is expected.\n2. Statement (A) presents an incorrect fact (bikes are stationary), which could be used sarcastically to mock someone's misunderstanding.\n3. Statement (B) presents a correct fact (bikes aren't stationary), which is straightforward and lacks the irony typical of sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an incorrect fact in a way that could mock someone's lack of understanding.\n\n<<<A>>>"
