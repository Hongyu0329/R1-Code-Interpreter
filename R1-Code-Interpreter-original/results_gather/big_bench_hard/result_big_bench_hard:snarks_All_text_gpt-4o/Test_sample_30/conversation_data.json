    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - \"So he's planning to continue leaving useless space junk in orbit literally just because he can. What a horrible person.\"\n   - Analysis: The statement describes an action (leaving space junk in orbit) that is generally considered negative. The follow-up comment \"What a horrible person\" aligns with the negative action described. There is no contradiction or irony here, so this statement is likely not sarcastic.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - \"So he's planning to continue leaving useless space junk in orbit literally just because he can. What a brilliant person.\"\n   - Analysis: The statement describes the same negative action (leaving space junk in orbit). However, the follow-up comment \"What a brilliant person\" contradicts the negative nature of the action. This contradiction suggests irony or sarcasm, as the speaker likely does not genuinely believe the person is brilliant for leaving space junk in orbit.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony by praising someone for an action that is generally viewed negatively.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) So he's planning to continue leaving useless space junk in orbit literally just because he can. What a brilliant person"
