    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is true or expected, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement (A):** \"Armed revolutionaries have not been making a lot of change for middle class Americans lately.\"\n   - **Statement (B):** \"Armed revolutionaries have been making a lot of change for middle class Americans lately.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (A):**\n   - This statement suggests that armed revolutionaries have not been effective in bringing about change for middle class Americans.\n   - If this statement is sarcastic, it would imply that armed revolutionaries actually have been making a lot of change, which is contrary to the literal meaning.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (B):**\n   - This statement suggests that armed revolutionaries have been effective in bringing about change for middle class Americans.\n   - If this statement is sarcastic, it would imply that armed revolutionaries have not been making a lot of change, which is contrary to the literal meaning.\n\n4. **Contextual Considerations:**\n   - Sarcasm often relies on the context or common knowledge that the literal statement is unlikely or absurd.\n   - In a typical context, it is unlikely that armed revolutionaries are actively making significant changes for middle class Americans, as such events are rare and would be widely reported.\n\n5. **Determining Sarcasm:**\n   - Statement (A) aligns with the likely reality that armed revolutionaries are not making significant changes, so it is less likely to be sarcastic.\n   - Statement (B) contradicts the likely reality and suggests an unlikely scenario, making it more likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
