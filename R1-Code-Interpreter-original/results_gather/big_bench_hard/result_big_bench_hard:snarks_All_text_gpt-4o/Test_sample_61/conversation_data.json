    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nOption (A):\n- The statement begins by saying that the graphics guy spent only 15 minutes on work and the rest of the time messing around. This suggests a negative view of the employee's work ethic.\n- The follow-up statement, \"Their employees are always the laziest!\" aligns with the initial negative observation. There is no contradiction or irony here; the statement is straightforwardly critical.\n\nOption (B):\n- Similarly, this statement starts with the observation that the graphics guy spent only 15 minutes on work and the rest of the time messing around, which is a negative observation.\n- However, the follow-up statement, \"Their employees are always the best!\" contradicts the initial negative observation. This creates irony, as the statement praises the employees despite the negative context, suggesting sarcasm.\n\nIn summary, sarcasm is present when there is a contradiction between the literal meaning of the words and the context or tone. Option (B) contains this contradiction, as it praises the employees despite the negative context, indicating sarcasm.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B)"
