    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Ah yes, late night vote on a bill written behind closed doors by one party. How undemocratic\"\n   - The statement describes a situation where a bill is voted on late at night, written behind closed doors, and by only one party. This description suggests a lack of transparency and inclusivity, which are generally considered undemocratic practices.\n   - The phrase \"How undemocratic\" aligns with the description provided, as the situation described indeed seems undemocratic. There is no contradiction or irony here, so this statement is likely not sarcastic.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Ah yes, late night vote on a bill written behind closed doors by one party. How democratic\"\n   - This statement describes the same situation as Option (A), which is characterized by a lack of transparency and inclusivity.\n   - The phrase \"How democratic\" contradicts the description, as the situation described is generally considered undemocratic. This contradiction suggests irony, as the speaker is likely implying the opposite of what is stated, making it sarcastic.\n\nBy analyzing both options, we can conclude that Option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to highlight the undemocratic nature of the situation while stating the opposite.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Ah yes, late night vote on a bill written behind closed doors by one party. How democratic"
