    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical usage of the terms involved in each statement.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt. It often relies on context and tone, which are not present in written text, making it challenging to identify without additional cues.\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (A)**: \"Working the printer is too complex for me.\"\n   - **Context**: Printers are generally considered to be user-friendly devices. Most people can operate a printer with basic instructions, and they are common in homes and offices.\n   - **Potential for Sarcasm**: Given that printers are not typically seen as complex, saying that working a printer is too complex could be sarcastic. The speaker might be implying that the task is actually simple, but they are exaggerating the difficulty for humorous effect.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (B)**: \"Working the microprocessor is too complex for me.\"\n   - **Context**: Microprocessors are intricate components of computers and other electronic devices. They require specialized knowledge to understand and work with directly.\n   - **Potential for Sarcasm**: Since microprocessors are genuinely complex, stating that they are too complex for someone is likely a straightforward statement of fact rather than sarcasm. It is reasonable for someone to find microprocessors complex, so there is less likelihood of sarcasm here.\n\n4. **Comparison**: \n   - Statement (A) involves a task that is generally simple, making it a candidate for sarcasm if the speaker is exaggerating the difficulty.\n   - Statement (B) involves a genuinely complex task, making it less likely to be sarcastic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it involves exaggerating the difficulty of a simple task, which is a common form of sarcasm.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
