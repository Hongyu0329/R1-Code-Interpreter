    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the tone of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - \"You mean your team did the most damage, then you just did the final blow. Amazing display of team skill.\"\n   - Analysis: The statement acknowledges that the team did most of the work, and the speaker is attributing the success to team skill. This seems straightforward and not sarcastic because it aligns with the idea of teamwork.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - \"You mean your team did the most damage, then you just did the final blow. Amazing display of individual skill.\"\n   - Analysis: Here, the statement acknowledges that the team did most of the work, but the speaker is attributing the success to individual skill. This is ironic because the individual only delivered the final blow, while the team did most of the work. The use of \"individual skill\" in this context is likely sarcastic, as it contradicts the reality of the situation.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is sarcastic because it uses irony to highlight the discrepancy between the individual's contribution and the credit given for individual skill.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) You mean your team did the most damage, then you just did the final blow. Amazing display of individual skill"
