    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - \"College is happening: forgetting assignments, stressing over grades, worrying about finals, etc.\"\n   - \"It's been a stressful semester.\"\n   - Analysis: The first part of the statement lists negative aspects of college life, such as forgetting assignments, stressing over grades, and worrying about finals. The second part, \"It's been a stressful semester,\" aligns with the negative aspects mentioned. There is no contradiction or irony here; the statement is straightforward and sincere.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - \"College is happening: forgetting assignments, stressing over grades, worrying about finals, etc.\"\n   - \"It's been a fun semester.\"\n   - Analysis: The first part of the statement is identical to Option (A), listing negative aspects of college life. However, the second part, \"It's been a fun semester,\" contradicts the negative experiences described. This contradiction suggests irony or sarcasm, as the speaker is likely implying that the semester has not been fun at all, given the stress and challenges mentioned.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is sarcastic because it uses irony by describing a stressful and challenging semester as \"fun,\" which is the opposite of what the speaker likely means.\n\n<<<B>>>"
