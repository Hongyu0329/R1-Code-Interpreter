    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Yeah the presence of those inner city criminals, and welfare leeches have truly caused me to suffer\"\n   - The statement suggests that the speaker is suffering due to the presence of \"inner city criminals\" and \"welfare leeches.\"\n   - If taken literally, this statement could be interpreted as a genuine complaint about the negative impact of these groups on the speaker's life.\n   - However, the use of the word \"truly\" can imply sarcasm, as it might be used to emphasize the opposite of what is being stated, especially if the speaker does not actually believe they are suffering.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Yeah the presence of those inner city criminals, and welfare leeches have truly caused me to thrive\"\n   - This statement suggests that the speaker is thriving due to the presence of \"inner city criminals\" and \"welfare leeches.\"\n   - The idea that these groups would cause someone to thrive is counterintuitive and unlikely to be a genuine sentiment.\n   - The use of \"truly\" here also suggests sarcasm, as it emphasizes an unlikely or absurd outcome, indicating that the speaker does not actually believe they are thriving because of these groups.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Both statements use the word \"truly,\" which can be a marker of sarcasm, as it often emphasizes the opposite of what is meant.\n- Option (A) could be sarcastic if the speaker does not actually feel they are suffering, but it could also be a genuine complaint.\n- Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an absurd outcome (thriving due to criminals and welfare leeches), which is unlikely to be a genuine sentiment.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is more clearly sarcastic is Option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Yeah the presence of those inner city criminals, and welfare leeches have truly caused me to thrive"
