    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context implied by each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"You mean you're only into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?\"\n   - This statement suggests that the person being addressed has a preference for bullies with narcissistic personality disorder. \n   - The use of \"only\" implies exclusivity, which can be seen as an exaggeration or an unlikely scenario.\n   - The tone could be interpreted as mocking or incredulous, as it is unusual for someone to have such a specific and negative preference.\n   - The sarcasm here would lie in the implication that it is absurd to be exclusively interested in such a negative trait.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"You mean you're not into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?\"\n   - This statement suggests that the person being addressed is not interested in bullies with narcissistic personality disorder.\n   - The tone here is more straightforward and does not carry the same level of incredulity or exaggeration as option (A).\n   - It is less likely to be sarcastic because it does not imply an absurd or exaggerated scenario.\n\nBy comparing both options, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it implies an exaggerated and unlikely preference, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) You mean you're only into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?"
