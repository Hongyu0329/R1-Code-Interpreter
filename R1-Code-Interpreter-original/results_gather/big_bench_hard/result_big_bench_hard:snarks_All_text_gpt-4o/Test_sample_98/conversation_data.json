    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical characteristics of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way, to convey contempt or humor.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption (A): \"He doesn't want high risk investment? He should put it all on bitcoin!\"\n- Context: The person does not want high-risk investments.\n- Suggestion: The person should invest in bitcoin.\n- Analysis: Bitcoin is generally considered a high-risk investment due to its volatility and unpredictability. Suggesting someone who doesn't want high-risk investments to invest in bitcoin is ironic and likely sarcastic because it contradicts the person's stated preference.\n\nOption (B): \"He doesn't want low risk investment? He should put it all on bitcoin!\"\n- Context: The person does not want low-risk investments.\n- Suggestion: The person should invest in bitcoin.\n- Analysis: Since the person does not want low-risk investments, suggesting bitcoin, which is high-risk, aligns with their preference. Therefore, this statement is not sarcastic because it does not contradict the person's stated preference.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (A) is sarcastic because it suggests the opposite of what the person wants, using irony to highlight the contradiction.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
