    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the content of each option.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is true or expected, often in a mocking or ironic way.\n   - In this case, the statements are about the cost of fuel per mile for a van, and whether these costs are \"perfectly reasonable.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A):**\n   - \"That's only about $0.15 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs.\"\n   - $0.15 per mile is a relatively low cost for fuel, which could be considered reasonable or even cheap.\n   - The statement aligns with the expectation that low costs are reasonable, so it is likely not sarcastic.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B):**\n   - \"That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs.\"\n   - $10 per mile is an extremely high cost for fuel, which is generally considered unreasonable or exorbitant.\n   - The use of \"only\" and \"perfectly reasonable\" in this context is likely intended to be ironic, as $10 per mile is far from reasonable.\n   - This mismatch between the statement and the reality suggests sarcasm.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Option (B) is likely sarcastic because it describes an unreasonably high cost as \"perfectly reasonable,\" which is contrary to what one would expect.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs"
