    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the meaning and implications of each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or contemptuous tone. The speaker's true intent is usually the opposite of the literal meaning of the words.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Literal Meaning: The speaker does not believe that the felon, who has committed multiple felonies and just murdered someone, would not lie. This implies that the speaker actually believes the felon would lie.\n   - Sarcastic Interpretation: If the speaker is being sarcastic, they might actually mean that they do believe the felon would lie, but they are saying the opposite to emphasize the obviousness of the felon's untrustworthiness.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Literal Meaning: The speaker does not believe that the felon, who has committed multiple felonies and just murdered someone, would lie. This implies that the speaker believes the felon is telling the truth.\n   - Sarcastic Interpretation: If the speaker is being sarcastic, they might actually mean that they do believe the felon would lie, but they are saying the opposite to mock the idea that the felon could be trustworthy.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - In Option (A), the statement is structured in a way that the speaker is expressing disbelief in the felon's honesty, which aligns with the expectation that a felon would lie. The sarcasm here would be in the form of pretending to believe the felon wouldn't lie, which is contrary to the expectation.\n   - In Option (B), the statement is structured to express belief in the felon's honesty, which is contrary to the expectation that a felon would lie. The sarcasm here would be in the form of pretending to believe the felon would tell the truth, which is contrary to the expectation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it directly contradicts the expectation that a felon would lie. The speaker is likely mocking the idea that the felon could be honest, which is a classic use of sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
