    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"You are mistaken when you say that he should have just let them get away for assaulting him.\"\n   - This statement is straightforward and does not contain any elements of sarcasm. It directly states that the person is wrong in their belief that he should have let them get away. There is no irony or contradiction in the statement.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"You are right when you say that he should have just let them get away for assaulting him.\"\n   - This statement is likely sarcastic. The idea that someone should let others get away with assault is generally considered unreasonable or absurd. By saying \"You are right\" in this context, the speaker is likely using irony to convey the opposite of what they actually believe, suggesting that it is not right to let them get away.\n\nConsidering the analysis, Option (B) is the statement that uses sarcasm to convey its message.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) You are right when you say that he should have just let them get away for assaulting him"
