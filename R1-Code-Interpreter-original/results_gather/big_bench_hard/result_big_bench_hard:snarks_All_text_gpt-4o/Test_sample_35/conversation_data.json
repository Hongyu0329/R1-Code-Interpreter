    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what one actually means, often for humorous or emphatic effect. It can also involve exaggeration or irony.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) \"The two minute wait in line is too long for me, I think I'll just leave.\"\n- A two-minute wait is generally considered very short. Saying that it is \"too long\" is an exaggeration, as most people would not find a two-minute wait to be excessive. This exaggeration suggests sarcasm, as the speaker likely does not actually find two minutes to be too long.\n\n(B) \"The two hour wait in line is too long for me, I think I'll just leave.\"\n- A two-hour wait is indeed a long time to wait in line. Saying that it is \"too long\" is a reasonable and straightforward statement. There is no exaggeration or irony here, so it is unlikely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it involves an exaggeration that is contrary to the typical perception of a short wait time.\n\n<<<A>>>"
