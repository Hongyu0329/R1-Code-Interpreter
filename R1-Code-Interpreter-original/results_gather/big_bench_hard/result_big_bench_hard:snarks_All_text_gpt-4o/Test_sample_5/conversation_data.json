    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical expectations associated with takeout meals.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt. It relies heavily on context and common knowledge.\n\n2. **Context of Takeout Meals**: \n   - Takeout meals are commonly associated with convenience and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, they typically use inexpensive and disposable packaging materials.\n   - Plastic containers are very common for takeout meals due to their low cost and practicality.\n   - Hardwood containers are not typical for takeout meals as they are more expensive and not as practical for disposable use.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (A)**:\n   - \"Wow thats crazy, I've never had a takeout meal that used hardwood containers before!\"\n   - This statement could be interpreted as genuine surprise or sarcasm. However, given that hardwood containers are indeed unusual for takeout, the statement could be taken at face value as genuine surprise.\n\n4. **Analyzing Statement (B)**:\n   - \"Wow thats crazy, I've never had a takeout meal that used plastic containers before!\"\n   - This statement is likely sarcastic because plastic containers are extremely common for takeout. The speaker is likely implying that it is not crazy at all, but rather the norm.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Statement (B) is sarcastic because it expresses surprise at something that is very common and expected, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
