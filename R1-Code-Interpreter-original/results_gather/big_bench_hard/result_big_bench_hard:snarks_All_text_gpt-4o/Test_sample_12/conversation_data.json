    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical understanding of the terms used in each statement.\n\n1. **Understanding Anarchism and Democracy:**\n   - **Anarchism** is a political philosophy that advocates for self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. It is often characterized by the absence of a governing authority or state. Anarchism is not typically recognized as a mainstream or traditional governing system in the way that democracy is.\n   - **Democracy** is a widely recognized and practiced form of government where the power is vested in the people, who rule either directly or through freely elected representatives. It is commonly taught as a prime example of a governing system in educational contexts.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Statements:**\n   - **Statement (A):** \"Yeah, anarchism is taught as a prime example of a governing system.\"\n     - Given that anarchism is not a conventional governing system and is often associated with the absence of government, this statement could be seen as sarcastic. The use of \"Yeah\" at the beginning can imply a tone of disbelief or irony, suggesting that the speaker does not genuinely believe anarchism is taught as a prime example of a governing system.\n   - **Statement (B):** \"Yeah, democracy is taught as a prime example of a governing system.\"\n     - Democracy is indeed a prime example of a governing system and is commonly taught as such. The statement aligns with the general understanding and does not carry an inherent tone of sarcasm.\n\n3. **Determining Sarcasm:**\n   - Sarcasm often involves saying something in a way that implies the opposite of the literal meaning, often for humorous or emphatic effect. In this context, the statement about anarchism being taught as a prime example of a governing system is likely sarcastic because it contradicts the typical understanding of anarchism.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
