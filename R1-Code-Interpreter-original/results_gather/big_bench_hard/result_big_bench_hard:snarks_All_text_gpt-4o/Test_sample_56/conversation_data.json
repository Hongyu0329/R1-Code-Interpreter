    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Right, because everyone buys insurance based on the possibility of a riot\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** This statement suggests that people commonly buy insurance specifically for riots.\n   - **Realistic Context:** In reality, most people buy insurance for more common risks like accidents, theft, or natural disasters. Riots are relatively rare events, and not a primary reason for most people to purchase insurance.\n   - **Sarcastic Tone:** The use of \"Right\" at the beginning implies a sarcastic tone, as if the speaker is mocking the idea that riots are a common reason for buying insurance.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Right, because everyone buys insurance based on the possibility of an accident\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** This statement suggests that people buy insurance because accidents are a possibility.\n   - **Realistic Context:** Accidents are indeed a common reason for purchasing insurance. This statement aligns with the typical reasons people buy insurance.\n   - **Sarcastic Tone:** There is no apparent sarcasm here, as the statement is factual and aligns with common behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Option (A) is sarcastic because it mocks the idea that riots are a common reason for buying insurance, which is not typically the case.\n- Option (B) is straightforward and factual, lacking any sarcastic tone.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Right, because everyone buys insurance based on the possibility of a riot"
