    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to understand the literal meaning of each statement and then consider the context in which sarcasm might be used.\n\n1. **Understanding the Literal Meaning:**\n   - **Option (A):** \"People never foment wars to relinquish territory.\"\n     - Literal Meaning: This statement suggests that people do not start wars with the intention of giving up or surrendering territory. \n     - Real-world Context: Historically, wars are typically fought to gain territory, not to give it up. Therefore, the literal meaning of this statement is generally true, as it aligns with common historical motivations for war.\n\n   - **Option (B):** \"People never foment wars to conquer territory.\"\n     - Literal Meaning: This statement suggests that people do not start wars with the intention of conquering or acquiring territory.\n     - Real-world Context: This is contrary to historical evidence, as many wars have been fought with the primary goal of conquering territory. Therefore, the literal meaning of this statement is generally false.\n\n2. **Identifying Sarcasm:**\n   - Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is true or expected, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n   - **Option (A):** Since the literal meaning aligns with historical motivations (people do not start wars to give up territory), it is less likely to be sarcastic.\n   - **Option (B):** Since the literal meaning contradicts historical motivations (people often start wars to conquer territory), it is more likely to be sarcastic. The statement could be mocking the idea that wars are not fought for conquest, which is contrary to common understanding.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it states the opposite of what is commonly understood about the motivations for war.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) People never foment wars to conquer territory"
