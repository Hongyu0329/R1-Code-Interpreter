    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and the logical implications of each statement.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It usually involves a contrast between the literal meaning of the words and the intended meaning.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Statement: \"My laptop didn't work when I brought it underwater, therefore it must be Asus's fault that it broke down.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: The speaker is blaming Asus for the laptop's failure after it was taken underwater.\n   - Logical Implication: It is common knowledge that electronic devices, including laptops, are not designed to function underwater. Blaming the manufacturer for a laptop's failure in such a scenario is illogical.\n   - Sarcasm Detection: The statement is likely sarcastic because the speaker is mockingly blaming Asus for something that is clearly not their fault, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Statement: \"My laptop didn't work when I brought it underwater, therefore it must be my fault that it broke down.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: The speaker is taking responsibility for the laptop's failure after it was taken underwater.\n   - Logical Implication: This statement aligns with common sense, as it is indeed the user's fault for using the laptop in an inappropriate environment.\n   - Sarcasm Detection: The statement is straightforward and does not contain any verbal irony or contradiction. It is a logical admission of fault.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Option (A) contains a contradiction between the literal blame placed on Asus and the common understanding that laptops are not waterproof, indicating sarcasm.\n   - Option (B) is a straightforward acknowledgment of personal responsibility, with no irony or contradiction.\n\nBased on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>A"
