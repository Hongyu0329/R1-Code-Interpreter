    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way. Let's examine each option:\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....zero\"\n   - Literal Interpretation: This statement suggests that there is no chance of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely.\n   - Sarcastic Interpretation: If the speaker believes that there is actually a significant risk of hacking, they might sarcastically say \"zero\" to mock the idea that there is no risk.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....high\"\n   - Literal Interpretation: This statement suggests that there is a high chance of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely.\n   - Sarcastic Interpretation: If the speaker believes that the risk is actually low, they might sarcastically say \"high\" to mock the idea that the risk is significant.\n\nTo determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to consider the context in which sarcasm is typically used. Sarcasm is often employed to highlight the absurdity or unlikelihood of a situation. In the context of internet-connected cars, the general public concern is that there is a risk of hacking. Therefore, saying that the likelihood is \"zero\" when there is a known risk could be seen as sarcastic, as it contradicts the common understanding.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n- Sarcasm involves saying the opposite of what one means.\n- The context of internet-connected cars and hacking is important.\n- Public perception and concerns about hacking are relevant.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is Option (A), as it contradicts the common concern about the risk of hacking.\n\n<<<answer>>> Option (A)"
