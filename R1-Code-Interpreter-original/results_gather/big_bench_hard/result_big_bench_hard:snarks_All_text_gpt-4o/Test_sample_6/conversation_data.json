    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the underlying meaning of each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or contemptuous tone. It is used to convey disdain or to criticize indirectly.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Statement: \"Have you tried not being poor? It is much easier.\"\n   - Context: Poverty is a complex socio-economic issue that is not easily resolved by simply \"trying\" not to be poor. The statement implies that being poor is a choice, which is a simplistic and dismissive view of the challenges faced by those in poverty.\n   - Sarcasm Detection: The statement is likely sarcastic because it trivializes a serious issue by suggesting an unrealistic and overly simplistic solution, which is not genuinely meant to be taken seriously.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Statement: \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier.\"\n   - Context: Rudeness is a behavior that individuals can control to a certain extent. Suggesting someone try not to be rude is a straightforward suggestion that can be taken literally.\n   - Sarcasm Detection: This statement is less likely to be sarcastic because it presents a realistic and actionable suggestion. It does not carry the same level of irony or mockery as Option (A).\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Option (A) uses sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of suggesting that poverty can be easily overcome by choice, whereas Option (B) provides a direct and feasible suggestion regarding behavior.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Have you tried not being poor? It is much easier"
