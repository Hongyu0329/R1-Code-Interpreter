    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way, to convey contempt or humor.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) \"Just healthy meals wouldn't cut it for his active lifestyle.\"\n- This statement suggests that healthy meals alone are insufficient for his active lifestyle. It is a straightforward statement indicating that more than just healthy meals are needed. There is no apparent irony or contradiction in this statement, so it is unlikely to be sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"Just healthy meals cut it for his active lifestyle.\"\n- This statement suggests that healthy meals alone are sufficient for his active lifestyle. However, if the speaker believes that healthy meals are not enough, this statement could be sarcastic. The sarcasm would lie in the fact that the speaker is saying the opposite of what they believe to emphasize that healthy meals are inadequate.\n\nConsidering the typical use of sarcasm, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it could be interpreted as saying the opposite of what the speaker actually believes, especially if the speaker thinks that healthy meals alone are not enough for an active lifestyle.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
