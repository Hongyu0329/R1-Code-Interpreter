    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. Let's break down each option:\n\nOption (A): \"He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different\"\n- The phrase \"totally different\" is key here. The use of \"only urged\" suggests a softer, more benign action compared to \"threaten,\" which is more aggressive. However, the phrase \"totally different\" could be interpreted sarcastically, implying that urging and threatening are not as different as the speaker claims. The sarcasm would lie in the suggestion that urging can sometimes be just as forceful or coercive as threatening, despite the speaker's claim of a clear distinction.\n\nOption (B): \"He didn't threaten, he only pleaded; totally different\"\n- In this case, \"pleaded\" is indeed quite different from \"threatened.\" Pleading implies a request or appeal, often from a position of weakness or desperation, whereas threatening implies a position of power or aggression. The phrase \"totally different\" here is more likely to be taken at face value, as pleading and threatening are generally understood to be quite distinct actions. Therefore, this statement is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nConsidering the analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because the phrase \"totally different\" can be interpreted as ironic, suggesting that urging and threatening are not as different as they seem.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different"
