    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. Let's examine each option:\n\nOption (A): \"Basically you just have to be horribly rude and demanding. Make people feel bad and you'll get tons of trashy stuff.\"\n- This statement suggests that being rude and demanding will result in receiving \"trashy stuff.\" The term \"trashy stuff\" implies low-quality or undesirable items. The statement seems to be straightforward and not sarcastic because it aligns with the negative behavior described (being rude and demanding) leading to a negative outcome (receiving trashy stuff).\n\nOption (B): \"Basically you just have to be horribly rude and demanding. Make people feel bad and you'll get tons of free stuff.\"\n- This statement suggests that being rude and demanding will result in receiving \"free stuff.\" The term \"free stuff\" typically has a positive connotation, implying that one receives something of value without cost. The statement is likely sarcastic because it contrasts the negative behavior (being rude and demanding) with a seemingly positive outcome (receiving free stuff). The irony lies in the suggestion that such negative behavior would be rewarded with something desirable, which is contrary to social norms and expectations.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to suggest that negative behavior will lead to a positive outcome, which is not typically the case.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Basically you just have to be horribly rude and demanding. Make people feel bad and you'll get tons of free stuff"
