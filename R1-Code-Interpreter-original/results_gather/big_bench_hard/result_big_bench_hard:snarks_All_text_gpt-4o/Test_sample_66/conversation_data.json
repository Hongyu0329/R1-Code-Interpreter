    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - \"ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ???\" - This part of the statement suggests disbelief or incredulity that someone could like the system. The use of all caps and multiple question marks indicates a strong emotional reaction, likely negative.\n   - \"Have my up vote for being rational\" - This part seems to contradict the first part. If the speaker truly believed the person was insane for liking the system, they would not genuinely offer an up vote for being rational. The use of \"rational\" here is likely ironic, as the speaker does not actually believe the person is being rational.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - \"ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ???\" - Similar to Option (A), this part expresses disbelief or incredulity.\n   - \"Have my down vote for being rational\" - This part aligns with the disbelief expressed in the first part. If the speaker thinks the person is insane for liking the system, giving a down vote is consistent with that belief. There is no contradiction or irony here.\n\nIn summary, Option (A) contains a contradiction between the disbelief expressed in the first part and the seemingly positive action of giving an up vote in the second part. This contradiction suggests sarcasm, as the speaker is likely not sincere in offering an up vote for being \"rational.\"\n\nOption (B), on the other hand, is consistent throughout and does not exhibit the same level of irony or contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
