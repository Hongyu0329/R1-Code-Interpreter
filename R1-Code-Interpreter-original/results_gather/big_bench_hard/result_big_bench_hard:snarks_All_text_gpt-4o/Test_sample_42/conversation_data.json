    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying something in a way that implies the opposite of what is literally being said, often for humorous or critical effect.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - \"I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a server threatening issue.\"\n   - This statement suggests that the speaker is aware of the potential consequences of letting emails pile up, which could lead to technical issues with the server. The phrase \"server threatening issue\" is a hyperbolic way to describe the situation, but it is a plausible outcome if emails are not managed properly. The tone here is more literal and less likely to be sarcastic because it describes a realistic consequence.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - \"I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a life threatening issue.\"\n   - This statement uses the phrase \"life threatening issue\" to describe the consequence of letting emails pile up. This is an exaggerated and unrealistic outcome, as emails piling up would not directly threaten someone's life. The use of \"life threatening\" in this context is likely intended to be humorous or ironic, suggesting that the speaker is not seriously concerned about the emails but is instead mocking the situation by exaggerating its importance.\n\nBy comparing the two options, Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses an exaggerated and unrealistic consequence (\"life threatening issue\") to describe a mundane situation (emails piling up), which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B)"
