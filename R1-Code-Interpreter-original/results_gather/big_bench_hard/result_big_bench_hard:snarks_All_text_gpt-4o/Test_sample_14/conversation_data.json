    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one truly means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"One of the worst things to do working in retail was pushing a trolley of returns around the store putting them back.\"\n   - This statement is straightforward and expresses a negative sentiment about the task of pushing a trolley of returns. It does not appear to be sarcastic because it directly states that the task is one of the worst things to do, which is a common sentiment among retail workers.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"One of the enjoyable things to do working in retail was pushing a trolley of returns around the store putting them back.\"\n   - This statement claims that pushing a trolley of returns is enjoyable. Given the context of retail work, where such tasks are often seen as tedious and monotonous, this statement is likely sarcastic. The speaker might be using sarcasm to imply that the task is actually not enjoyable at all, contrary to what is stated.\n\nBy comparing both options, Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents a task that is typically considered unpleasant as enjoyable, which is a common use of sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) One of the enjoyable things to do working in retail was pushing a trolley of returns around the store putting them back"
