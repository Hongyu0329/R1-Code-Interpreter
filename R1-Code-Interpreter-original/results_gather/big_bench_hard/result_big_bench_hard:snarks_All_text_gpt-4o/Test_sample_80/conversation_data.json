    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one actually means, usually in a mocking or ironic way. Let's examine each option:\n\n(A) \"I'm sure you wouldn't have remained completely calm if a teacher attacked you.\"\n- This statement is straightforward and aligns with a reasonable expectation. It suggests that it is unlikely for someone to remain calm if attacked, which is a logical assumption. There is no apparent irony or contradiction in this statement, so it is not sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"I'm sure you would have remained completely calm if a teacher attacked you.\"\n- This statement, on the other hand, implies that someone would remain calm in a situation where it is highly unlikely to do so. The expectation of remaining calm during an attack is contrary to typical human reactions, which makes this statement ironic. The speaker likely does not believe that someone would actually remain calm, thus making it sarcastic.\n\nBy analyzing both statements, we can conclude that option (B) is the sarcastic one because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is expected in a given situation.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) I'm sure you would have remained completely calm if a teacher attacked you"
