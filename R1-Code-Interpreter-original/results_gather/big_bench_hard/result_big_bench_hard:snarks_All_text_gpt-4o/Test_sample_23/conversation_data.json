    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - \"You're right, it's the first week of winter!\" suggests that winter is just beginning.\n   - \"It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game\" implies that the speaker expects the weather to warm up soon.\n   - Since winter is typically associated with colder weather, the expectation of it getting warmer soon after winter begins is contrary to common experience. This contradiction suggests sarcasm, as the speaker likely does not genuinely believe it will get warmer.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - \"You're right, it's the last week of winter!\" indicates that winter is ending.\n   - \"It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game\" aligns with the natural expectation that temperatures will rise as winter ends and spring begins.\n   - There is no contradiction here, as it is reasonable to expect warmer weather after winter ends. Therefore, this statement is likely not sarcastic.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (A) contains a contradiction between the expectation of warmer weather and the fact that winter is just starting, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.\n   - Option (B) aligns with natural expectations and lacks the irony needed for sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) You're right, it's the first week of winter! It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game"
