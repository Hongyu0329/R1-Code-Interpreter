    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically to mock or convey contempt.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement (A):** \"Violence is a perfect way to unleash your frustrations.\"\n   - **Statement (B):** \"Exercise is a perfect way to unleash your frustrations.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (A):**\n   - Violence is generally considered harmful and destructive. It is not typically endorsed as a healthy or appropriate way to deal with frustrations.\n   - Saying that violence is \"perfect\" for dealing with frustrations is likely to be sarcastic because it contradicts common societal values that promote non-violence and peaceful conflict resolution.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (B):**\n   - Exercise is widely recognized as a healthy and effective way to manage stress and frustrations. It is often recommended by health professionals for its physical and mental health benefits.\n   - Saying that exercise is \"perfect\" for dealing with frustrations aligns with common advice and is not contradictory or mocking.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Statement (A) is likely sarcastic because it suggests something contrary to common beliefs and values, using the word \"perfect\" in a context where it is not typically appropriate.\n   - Statement (B) is straightforward and aligns with common health advice, so it is not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
