    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - \"God, to think of how good it could have been having a person who prepared for things ahead of time in office.\"\n   - This statement appears to express a positive sentiment about having a prepared person in office. However, the use of \"God, to think of how good it could have been\" suggests a lament or regret, implying that the current situation is not good. The sarcasm here lies in the fact that the speaker is likely criticizing the current officeholder for not being prepared, by ironically stating how \"good\" it could have been.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - \"God, to think of how bad it could have been having a person who prepared for things ahead of time in office.\"\n   - This statement seems to express a negative sentiment about having a prepared person in office. However, logically, having someone prepared is generally seen as a positive trait. The sarcasm here would be in the suggestion that being prepared is somehow bad, which is contrary to common sense. This statement is likely mocking the idea that preparation is unnecessary or undesirable.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Both statements use irony, but the key difference is in the expected outcome of having a prepared person in office. \n- Option (A) sarcastically implies that the current situation is bad because the person in office is not prepared, using irony to highlight the deficiency.\n- Option (B) sarcastically implies that being prepared is bad, which is contrary to common expectations, thus mocking the idea that preparation is negative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Option (A) uses sarcasm to criticize the lack of preparation in the current officeholder by ironically stating how \"good\" it could have been.\n- Option (B) uses sarcasm to mock the idea that preparation is bad, which is less direct in its criticism of the current situation.\n\nGiven the context and typical use of sarcasm to criticize or mock, Option (A) is more directly sarcastic in its criticism of the current situation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
