    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - \"Working at a restaurant has made me an amazing chef.\"\n   - This statement could be taken at face value. Working at a restaurant, depending on the type and quality, could indeed improve someone's cooking skills and make them a better chef. There is no inherent irony or contradiction in this statement, as it is plausible and can be true.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - \"Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef.\"\n   - McDonald's is a fast-food chain known for its standardized and highly automated cooking processes. The skills required to work at McDonald's are generally not associated with the culinary expertise needed to be considered an \"amazing chef.\" Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic because it implies that working at a fast-food chain, which typically does not involve complex cooking techniques, has somehow elevated the speaker to the level of an \"amazing chef.\" The irony lies in the contrast between the expected skill level of a McDonald's employee and the high level of skill implied by the term \"amazing chef.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (A) is straightforward and can be taken literally.\n   - Option (B) contains an ironic contrast between the job and the outcome, making it sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is sarcastic is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
