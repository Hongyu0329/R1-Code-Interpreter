    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying something in a way that implies the opposite of what is literally stated, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - (A) \"SCIENCE CAUSES VACCINES!\"\n   - (B) \"EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!\"\n\n2. **Literal Interpretation:**\n   - Statement (A) suggests that science is responsible for the development of vaccines. This is a factual statement, as scientific research and methods are indeed what lead to the creation of vaccines.\n   - Statement (B) suggests that evolution is responsible for the development of vaccines. This is not a typical or factual statement, as evolution is a biological process that explains the diversity of life and is not directly responsible for the creation of vaccines.\n\n3. **Analyzing for Sarcasm:**\n   - Statement (A) is straightforward and factual. It does not contain any elements that would typically be used sarcastically.\n   - Statement (B), on the other hand, attributes the creation of vaccines to evolution, which is not accurate. This could be seen as sarcastic because it might be mocking the misunderstanding or misattribution of scientific concepts.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Statement (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an incorrect attribution in a way that could be mocking or ridiculing a misunderstanding of science.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
