    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"An NFL Head coach with a losing record that hasn't been on a field on ten years? This is gonna go great.\"\n   - **Context:** The statement describes a coach with a losing record who hasn't been active for ten years.\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** The speaker is saying that the situation will go great.\n   - **Sarcastic Interpretation:** Given the negative context (losing record, long absence), saying \"This is gonna go great\" is likely sarcastic. The speaker probably means the opposite, implying that it will not go well.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"An NFL Head coach with a losing record that hasn't been on a field on ten years? This is gonna go terribly.\"\n   - **Context:** The same negative context is presented.\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** The speaker is saying that the situation will go terribly.\n   - **Sarcastic Interpretation:** The statement aligns with the negative context, so it is likely not sarcastic. The speaker is probably being straightforward about their expectation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Option (A) is likely sarcastic because it uses a positive statement (\"This is gonna go great\") in a context that suggests a negative outcome.\n- Option (B) is likely not sarcastic because it directly states a negative outcome, which aligns with the context.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
