    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Statement: \"Why would they have weapons drawn when they've been called to the scene of a fire?\"\n   - Context: Firefighters or emergency responders are typically called to a fire, not armed personnel. The presence of weapons in this context is unusual and unnecessary.\n   - Implied Meaning: The speaker is likely pointing out the absurdity of having weapons at a fire scene, suggesting that it is inappropriate or over-the-top.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Statement: \"Why would they have weapons drawn when they've been called to the scene of a shooting?\"\n   - Context: In a shooting scenario, it is common and expected for law enforcement to have weapons drawn for protection and to address the threat.\n   - Implied Meaning: The statement is straightforward and aligns with the expected response in such a situation. There is no irony or contradiction.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Option (A) uses irony by highlighting the mismatch between the situation (a fire) and the response (weapons drawn), which is not typical or necessary.\n   - Option (B) describes a situation where the response (weapons drawn) is appropriate and expected, lacking the irony needed for sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is Option (A) because it uses irony to highlight the absurdity of the situation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
