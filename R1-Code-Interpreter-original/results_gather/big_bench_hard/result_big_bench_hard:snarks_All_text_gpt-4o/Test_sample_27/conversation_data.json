    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to understand the nature of sarcasm. Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption (A): \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a smart move!\"\n- The first part of the statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship: without the river, there is no water and no electricity. This implies that the river is crucial for these resources.\n- The second part of the statement, \"Blocking it is such a smart move!\" seems to contradict the first part. If blocking the river leads to a lack of water and electricity, calling it a \"smart move\" is likely not genuine. Instead, it suggests that blocking the river is actually a foolish decision, making this statement sarcastic.\n\nOption (B): \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a terrible move!\"\n- The first part of the statement is the same as in option (A), establishing the importance of the river.\n- The second part, \"Blocking it is such a terrible move!\" aligns with the logical conclusion drawn from the first part. If blocking the river leads to negative consequences, calling it a \"terrible move\" is consistent and straightforward, not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is literally said.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
