    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Yeah, I'm sure you'd be so much happier if we never did anything for anyone ever.\"\n   - The phrase \"I'm sure you'd be so much happier\" suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite. The use of \"happier\" in this context is likely sarcastic because not doing anything for anyone is generally not associated with happiness. The speaker is likely mocking the idea that avoiding helping others would lead to happiness.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Yeah, I'm sure you'd be so much lonelier if we never did anything for anyone ever.\"\n   - The phrase \"I'm sure you'd be so much lonelier\" suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite. However, the idea of being lonelier if one never did anything for anyone could be taken literally, as not engaging with others could indeed lead to loneliness. Therefore, this statement is less likely to be sarcastic because it aligns with a logical outcome.\n\nBy analyzing both options, we can see that Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses irony to suggest the opposite of what is literally stated. The speaker is likely mocking the idea that avoiding helping others would lead to happiness, which is not a typical outcome.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Yeah, I'm sure you'd be so much happier if we never did anything for anyone ever"
