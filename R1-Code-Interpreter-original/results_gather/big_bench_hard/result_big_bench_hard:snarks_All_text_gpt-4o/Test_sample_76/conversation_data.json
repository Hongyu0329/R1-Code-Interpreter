    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Never had as much fun in my life as when the cops found my backpack of weed in my car trunk.\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** The speaker is claiming that the event of the cops finding their backpack of weed was the most fun they've ever had.\n   - **Contextual Analysis:** Being caught with illegal substances is generally not considered a fun experience. The use of \"fun\" in this context is likely ironic, as most people would find such a situation stressful or frightening.\n   - **Sarcasm Indicator:** The statement is likely sarcastic because it expresses a sentiment (having fun) that is opposite to what one would genuinely feel in such a situation.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Never had as much anxiety in my life when the cops found my backpack of weed in my car trunk.\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** The speaker is expressing that the event caused them a significant amount of anxiety.\n   - **Contextual Analysis:** It is reasonable to feel anxious if the police find illegal substances in one's possession. The statement aligns with the expected emotional response to the situation.\n   - **Sarcasm Indicator:** There is no indication of sarcasm here, as the statement reflects a genuine and expected reaction.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (A) is the statement that is sarcastic because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is expected in a stressful situation.\n\n<<<answer>>> Option (A)"
