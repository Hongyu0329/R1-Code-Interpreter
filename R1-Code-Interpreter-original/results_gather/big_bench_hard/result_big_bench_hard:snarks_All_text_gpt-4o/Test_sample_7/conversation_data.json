    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead.\"\n   - **Literal Meaning:** This statement suggests replacing modern trams with old-fashioned carriages.\n   - **Contextual Analysis:** In a modern context, suggesting a return to carriages (an outdated mode of transportation) instead of trams is likely not a serious proposal. It implies that the speaker finds the idea of getting rid of trams to be regressive or absurd.\n   - **Sarcasm Detection:** The statement is likely sarcastic because it mocks the idea of replacing a modern transportation system with an antiquated one, highlighting the absurdity of the suggestion.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead.\"\n   - **Literal Meaning:** This statement suggests replacing trams with lightrail, which is another form of modern public transportation.\n   - **Contextual Analysis:** Lightrail is often considered an upgrade or a more efficient form of transportation compared to trams. The statement could be a genuine suggestion for improvement rather than a sarcastic remark.\n   - **Sarcasm Detection:** The statement does not inherently carry a mocking or ironic tone. It seems more like a straightforward suggestion for modernization or improvement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Option (A) is sarcastic because it uses irony to mock the idea of replacing trams with an outdated mode of transportation, highlighting the absurdity of such a suggestion.\n- Option (B) is not sarcastic as it suggests a plausible and potentially beneficial change.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
