    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It usually involves a contrast between the literal meaning of the words and the intended meaning.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - The speaker describes a negative experience with Amazon packages: they are late, damaged, incorrect, or not functioning properly.\n   - The speaker then expresses disappointment about paying for free shipping with Prime.\n   - The word \"disappointed\" aligns with the negative experiences described, suggesting a straightforward expression of dissatisfaction rather than sarcasm.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Similarly, the speaker describes the same negative experience with Amazon packages.\n   - However, the speaker then expresses happiness about paying for free shipping with Prime.\n   - The word \"happy\" contrasts sharply with the negative experiences described, suggesting that the speaker is not genuinely happy. Instead, they are likely using sarcasm to highlight their dissatisfaction.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (A) uses language that is consistent with the negative experiences described, indicating a sincere expression of disappointment.\n   - Option (B) uses language that is inconsistent with the negative experiences described, indicating sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is Option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
