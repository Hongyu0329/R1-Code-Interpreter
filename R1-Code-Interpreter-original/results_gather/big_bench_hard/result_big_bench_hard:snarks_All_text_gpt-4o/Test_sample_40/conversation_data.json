    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the potential for sarcasm in each option. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is meant, often in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement A:** \"Protein supplements are way more expensive than $1 breakfast gruel.\"\n   - **Statement B:** \"Protein supplements are way more expensive than $1 breakfast burritos.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement A:**\n   - **Literal Meaning:** Protein supplements are more expensive than a very cheap and basic food item, \"breakfast gruel,\" which is typically associated with something plain and inexpensive.\n   - **Potential for Sarcasm:** The statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is implying that it's obvious or ridiculous to compare the cost of protein supplements to something as cheap as gruel. However, the statement itself is factually true, as protein supplements are indeed more expensive than $1 breakfast gruel.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement B:**\n   - **Literal Meaning:** Protein supplements are more expensive than $1 breakfast burritos, which are also inexpensive but more substantial and appealing than gruel.\n   - **Potential for Sarcasm:** The statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is highlighting the absurdity of comparing the cost of protein supplements to something as cheap as a $1 breakfast burrito. The sarcasm would lie in the exaggeration or mockery of the comparison, as it is obvious that protein supplements are more expensive.\n\n4. **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n   - Both statements compare the cost of protein supplements to inexpensive food items. However, the use of \"breakfast gruel\" in Statement A is already associated with something very cheap and unappealing, making the statement less likely to be sarcastic.\n   - Statement B, on the other hand, uses \"breakfast burritos,\" which are more substantial and appealing than gruel, making the comparison more likely to be sarcastic. The speaker might be mocking the idea of comparing the cost of protein supplements to something as trivial as a $1 burrito.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement B is more likely to be sarcastic due to the context and the nature of the comparison.\n\n<<<B>>>"
