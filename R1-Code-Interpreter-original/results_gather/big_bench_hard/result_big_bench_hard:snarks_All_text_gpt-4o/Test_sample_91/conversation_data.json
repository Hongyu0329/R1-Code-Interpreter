    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical expectations in a basketball scenario.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - In basketball, when a player is at halfcourt, they are far from the basket.\n   - A \"wide open pass\" suggests that there is an opportunity to pass the ball to a teammate who is in a better position, likely closer to the basket.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - **Option (A):** \"When you're at halfcourt and have a wide open pass, the obvious choice is to pass.\"\n     - This statement aligns with typical basketball strategy. Passing the ball to a teammate who is in a better position is a logical and expected action. There is no contradiction or unexpected element in this statement, so it is not sarcastic.\n   \n   - **Option (B):** \"When you're at halfcourt and have a wide open pass, the obvious choice is to shoot.\"\n     - This statement contradicts typical basketball strategy. Shooting from halfcourt, especially when there is a wide open pass available, is not the obvious choice. It is unexpected and goes against conventional wisdom, which makes it likely to be sarcastic. The sarcasm lies in the fact that shooting from such a distance is generally not advisable when a better option (passing) is available.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is expected or logical in a given situation. In this case, Option (B) presents an illogical choice as the \"obvious\" one, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
