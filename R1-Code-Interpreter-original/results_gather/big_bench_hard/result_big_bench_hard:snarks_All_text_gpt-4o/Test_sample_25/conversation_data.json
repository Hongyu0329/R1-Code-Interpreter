    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is true or expected, usually to mock or convey contempt.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - Sarcasm often relies on the listener's understanding of the actual situation being the opposite of what is stated.\n   - In both statements, the speaker is commenting on the cost of things over time.\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (A):**\n   - \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago.\"\n   - Over a span of eight years, it is common for prices to increase due to inflation and other economic factors.\n   - The statement implies that prices have not increased over eight years, which is unlikely and contrary to typical economic trends.\n   - Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic, as it suggests the opposite of the expected reality.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (B):**\n   - \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago.\"\n   - Over a short period of eight days, it is less likely for prices to change significantly.\n   - The statement implies that prices have remained stable over a short period, which is plausible and not contrary to expectations.\n   - Therefore, this statement is less likely to be sarcastic, as it aligns with the expected reality.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it suggests an unlikely scenario (no price increase over eight years), which is contrary to typical expectations.\n   - Statement (B) is less likely to be sarcastic because it aligns with the expected reality of price stability over a short period.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
