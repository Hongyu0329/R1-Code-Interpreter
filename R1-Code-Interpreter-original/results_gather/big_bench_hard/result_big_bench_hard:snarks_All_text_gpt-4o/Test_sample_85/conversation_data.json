    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the underlying meaning of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"We all know that no government in the world would ever ban anything that kills innovation.\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** This statement suggests that governments do not ban things that kill innovation.\n   - **Real-World Context:** In reality, governments often impose regulations or bans that can stifle innovation, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, the statement could be interpreted as sarcastic because it implies the opposite of what is often true in practice.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"We all know that no inventor in the world would ever ban anything that kills innovation.\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** This statement suggests that inventors do not ban things that kill innovation.\n   - **Real-World Context:** Inventors are typically individuals or groups focused on creating and fostering innovation. It is unlikely for inventors to ban things that kill innovation, as their primary goal is to innovate. Therefore, this statement is less likely to be sarcastic because it aligns with the general perception of inventors.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Sarcasm is more likely present in a statement that contradicts common knowledge or expectations.\n- Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it contradicts the common understanding that governments can and do implement bans that may hinder innovation.\n- Option (B) aligns with the general perception of inventors and does not carry the same level of irony or contradiction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) We all know that no government in the world would ever ban anything that kills innovation"
