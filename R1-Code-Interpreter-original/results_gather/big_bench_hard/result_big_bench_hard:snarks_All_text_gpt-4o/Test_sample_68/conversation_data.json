    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical connotations associated with the activities described. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one truly means, often for humorous or emphatic effect.\n\n1. **Understanding the Activity**: The activity in question is \"taking out and smelling the trash.\" Generally, this is not considered a pleasant or enjoyable task. Most people would find the smell of trash unpleasant, and taking out the trash is often seen as a chore rather than a favorite activity.\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (A)**: \n   - \"One of my least-favorite things to do working was taking out and smelling the trash.\"\n   - This statement aligns with the common perception of the activity. It is logical and straightforward, as taking out and smelling the trash is likely to be a least-favorite task for many people. There is no contradiction or unexpected element in this statement, so it is unlikely to be sarcastic.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (B)**:\n   - \"One of my favorite things to do working was taking out and smelling the trash.\"\n   - This statement contradicts the typical perception of the activity. Claiming that taking out and smelling the trash is a \"favorite\" activity is unexpected and likely not genuine. The contradiction between the unpleasant nature of the task and the claim of it being a favorite suggests sarcasm. The speaker is likely using sarcasm to humorously emphasize how much they dislike the task by pretending to enjoy it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Statement (B) is sarcastic because it presents an unlikely and contradictory claim about the enjoyment of an unpleasant task, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.\n\n<<<B>>>"
