    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the tone of the statements. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner. Let's break down the analysis:\n\n1. **Content Analysis**: Both statements are identical: \"It's easy to get into politics, all you have to do is be outrageous.\" The content suggests that getting into politics is simple if one is outrageous. \n\n2. **Literal Interpretation**: Literally, the statement suggests that being outrageous is a straightforward way to enter politics. This could be interpreted as a genuine belief or as a critique of the political system.\n\n3. **Sarcasm Detection**: \n   - If the speaker genuinely believes that being outrageous is a simple and effective way to enter politics, the statement is not sarcastic.\n   - If the speaker is using this statement to mock or criticize the political system, implying that it is absurd or problematic that being outrageous is a way to enter politics, then the statement is sarcastic.\n\n4. **Contextual Clues**: Without additional context, it is challenging to definitively determine sarcasm. However, the repetition of the statement in both options suggests that the question is testing the reader's ability to detect sarcasm based on the content alone.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that both options are identical and the question asks which statement is sarcastic, it implies that the statement is inherently sarcastic due to its content. The statement likely mocks the idea that being outrageous is a valid or commendable way to enter politics, thus highlighting a perceived flaw in the political system.\n\nTherefore, the statement is sarcastic.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) It's easy to get into politics, all you have to do to is be outrageous"
