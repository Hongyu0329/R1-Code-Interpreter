    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical implications of the statements.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It often relies on context and tone, which can be difficult to convey in written text without additional cues.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**: \"How could Government control of the internet be bad?\"\n   - Literal Interpretation: This statement suggests that government control of the internet is not bad.\n   - Sarcastic Interpretation: Given the common concerns about government control over the internet, such as censorship, loss of privacy, and restriction of freedom, this statement could be sarcastic. The speaker might actually mean that government control could indeed be bad, contrary to the literal interpretation.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**: \"How could Government control of the internet be beneficial?\"\n   - Literal Interpretation: This statement questions the benefits of government control over the internet.\n   - Sarcastic Interpretation: If the speaker believes that government control could have benefits, such as increased security or regulation of harmful content, this statement could be sarcastic. However, it is less likely to be sarcastic because questioning the benefits aligns with common concerns about government control.\n\n4. **Contextual Considerations**: Without additional context, sarcasm is often identified by the implausibility or irony of the statement. In this case, the idea that government control of the internet is not bad (Option A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it contradicts common criticisms and concerns.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an ironic view that contradicts the typical negative perception of government control over the internet.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) How could Government control of the internet be bad?"
