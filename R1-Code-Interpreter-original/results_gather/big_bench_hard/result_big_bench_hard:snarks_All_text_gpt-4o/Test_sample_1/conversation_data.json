    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying something in a way that implies the opposite of what is being said, often with a mocking or ironic tone.\n\n1. **Option (A): \"Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore\"**\n   - This statement suggests that simply being happy will prevent depression. \n   - The phrase \"just be happy\" can be seen as dismissive of the complexity of depression, implying that it's easy to overcome by simply choosing to be happy.\n   - The use of \"then you won't be depressed anymore\" implies a simplistic solution to a complex problem, which can be interpreted as sarcastic because it trivializes the issue.\n\n2. **Option (B): \"Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore\"**\n   - This statement suggests being happy about not being depressed anymore.\n   - The phrase \"just be happy that\" implies a reason to be happy, which is the absence of depression.\n   - This statement does not carry the same dismissive tone as Option (A) because it acknowledges a change in state (from depressed to not depressed) and suggests happiness about that change.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n- Sarcasm often involves a tone that is dismissive or mocking.\n- The context of mental health and depression is sensitive, and simplistic solutions can be seen as sarcastic.\n- The difference between the two statements lies in the implication of a solution versus a state of being.\n\n**Final Analysis:**\n- Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it implies a simplistic and dismissive solution to depression, which is a complex mental health issue.\n- Option (B) does not carry the same dismissive tone and instead suggests a reason to be happy.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is sarcastic is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore"
