    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"A wave of hypothermia and drownings will be a great way to start the year.\"\n   - **Literal Meaning:** The statement suggests that hypothermia and drownings are positive events.\n   - **Contextual Analysis:** Hypothermia and drownings are generally considered tragic and negative events. Describing them as a \"great way to start the year\" is contrary to the usual perception, indicating sarcasm. The speaker likely does not actually believe these events are great, but is using sarcasm to emphasize how undesirable they are.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"A wave of hypothermia and drownings will be a terrible way to start the year.\"\n   - **Literal Meaning:** The statement suggests that hypothermia and drownings are negative events.\n   - **Contextual Analysis:** This statement aligns with the common understanding that such events are indeed terrible. There is no contradiction or irony in this statement, so it is not sarcastic.\n\nBy comparing both options, we can see that Option (A) uses irony by describing a negative situation in a positive light, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. Option (B) straightforwardly describes the situation as negative, without any irony or sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
