    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Statement: \"I earn money for winning? Sign me up!\"\n   - Literal Meaning: The speaker is being offered money as a reward for winning, which is generally a positive and desirable situation.\n   - Implied Meaning: The statement seems straightforward and positive. The speaker is genuinely interested in the opportunity because it is beneficial.\n   - Sarcasm Check: There is no contradiction or irony in the statement. The speaker's enthusiasm matches the positive nature of the situation.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Statement: \"I lose money for winning? Sign me up!\"\n   - Literal Meaning: The speaker is being told they will lose money as a result of winning, which is an illogical and undesirable situation.\n   - Implied Meaning: The statement is likely not genuine. Winning typically results in a gain, not a loss, so the speaker's enthusiasm is likely feigned.\n   - Sarcasm Check: There is a clear contradiction between the negative outcome (losing money) and the positive expression (\"Sign me up!\"). This suggests the speaker is being sarcastic, as they are likely mocking the absurdity of the situation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (A) is straightforward and lacks irony, while Option (B) contains a contradiction and is likely sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) I lose money for winning? Sign me up!"
