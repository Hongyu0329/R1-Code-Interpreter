    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the inherent meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It usually involves exaggeration or absurdity to highlight the ridiculousness of a situation.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**: \n   - \"We should start a petition to ban breathing.\"\n   - Breathing is a fundamental biological process necessary for life. The idea of banning breathing is absurd and impossible, as it would mean the end of life. This statement is likely sarcastic because it exaggerates to the point of absurdity, suggesting that the speaker does not genuinely believe in banning breathing.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**: \n   - \"We should start a petition to ban vaping.\"\n   - Vaping is a controversial topic, with debates about its health effects and regulation. While some people genuinely advocate for stricter regulations or bans on vaping due to health concerns, the statement itself does not inherently contain the same level of absurdity or exaggeration as option (A). It could be a serious suggestion rather than a sarcastic one.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Option (A) uses an exaggerated and impossible scenario (banning breathing) to likely mock or criticize the idea of banning something essential or trivial.\n   - Option (B) presents a plausible suggestion that aligns with real-world debates and does not inherently carry the same level of absurdity or irony.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
