    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in each option. Sarcasm often involves saying something in a way that implies the opposite of what is literally stated, often for humorous or emphatic effect.\n\n1. **Option (A): \"Wow, you only applied to 200 internships this past week?\"**\n   - The use of \"only\" in this context is key. Applying to 200 internships in a week is an unusually high number, suggesting that the speaker is not genuinely impressed by the quantity but is instead highlighting the absurdity of applying to so many. The word \"only\" is used sarcastically here because 200 is not a small number, and the speaker is likely implying that this is an excessive amount.\n\n2. **Option (B): \"Wow, you only applied to 2 internships this past week?\"**\n   - In this case, applying to 2 internships in a week is a reasonable and realistic number. The use of \"only\" here could be interpreted as genuine surprise or disappointment that the number is low, but it does not carry the same level of absurdity or exaggeration as Option (A). Therefore, it is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBy comparing both options, Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses exaggeration (applying to 200 internships) to highlight the absurdity of the situation, whereas Option (B) does not have the same level of exaggeration or implied contradiction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
