    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - The statement is: \"What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a $50,000 scholarship.\"\n   - A $50,000 scholarship is generally considered a significant amount of money and a substantial reward for hard work.\n   - The use of \"only\" in this context suggests that the speaker is downplaying the value of the scholarship, which is ironic because $50,000 is a large sum.\n   - The phrase \"What a poor guy\" is likely not sincere, as receiving such a scholarship is typically a positive outcome.\n   - Therefore, the statement is likely sarcastic because it implies the opposite of what is literally being said.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - The statement is: \"What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a $50 scholarship.\"\n   - A $50 scholarship is a relatively small amount of money, especially considering \"years of work.\"\n   - The use of \"only\" is more literal here, as $50 is indeed a small reward for extensive effort.\n   - The phrase \"What a poor guy\" could be interpreted as genuine sympathy, as the reward does not match the effort.\n   - Therefore, the statement is likely not sarcastic because it aligns with the literal meaning.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (A) is sarcastic because it uses irony to convey that $50,000 is a small reward, which is contrary to the actual value of the scholarship.\n   - Option (B) is not sarcastic because it accurately reflects the small value of the $50 scholarship in relation to the effort.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
