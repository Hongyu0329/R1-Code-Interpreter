    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the meaning and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically to mock or convey contempt.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Option (A):** \"Since corporate restriction equals free speech this is actually a big win for democracy.\"\n   - **Option (B):** \"Since corporate money equals free speech this is actually a big win for democracy.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A):**\n   - The phrase \"corporate restriction equals free speech\" suggests that limiting corporate actions is equivalent to promoting free speech.\n   - The statement claims this is a \"big win for democracy.\"\n   - Typically, free speech is associated with fewer restrictions, not more. Therefore, equating restriction with free speech is contradictory and could be sarcastic.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B):**\n   - The phrase \"corporate money equals free speech\" refers to the idea that spending money is a form of expression protected under free speech.\n   - The statement claims this is a \"big win for democracy.\"\n   - This idea is often debated, with some arguing that equating money with speech gives undue influence to wealthy entities, potentially undermining democratic principles. Thus, calling it a \"big win for democracy\" could be sarcastic.\n\n4. **Determining Sarcasm:**\n   - Both statements contain elements that could be interpreted as sarcastic due to their contradictory nature.\n   - However, Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because the notion that corporate money equates to free speech is a contentious issue. Many people argue that it undermines democracy by allowing corporations to have disproportionate influence. Therefore, calling it a \"big win for democracy\" is likely intended to be sarcastic.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it highlights a controversial issue where the stated outcome (a big win for democracy) is contrary to the concerns many have about the influence of corporate money on democratic processes.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Since corporate money equals free speech this is actually a big win for democracy"
