    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to understand the nature of sarcasm. Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Only rich people can afford healthy food\n- This statement, taken literally, suggests that healthy food is expensive and only accessible to wealthy individuals. It does not inherently contain sarcasm unless the context or tone implies otherwise. Without additional context, it seems to be a straightforward statement about the affordability of healthy food.\n\n(B) Not only rich people can afford healthy food\n- This statement suggests that healthy food is accessible to a broader range of people, not just the wealthy. Again, without additional context or tone, it appears to be a straightforward statement.\n\nTo identify sarcasm, we need to consider which statement might be saying the opposite of what is meant. In many discussions about food affordability, there is a common belief or stereotype that only wealthy people can afford healthy food. If someone were to sarcastically comment on this stereotype, they might say, \"Only rich people can afford healthy food,\" implying the oppositeâ€”that healthy food should be accessible to everyone, not just the rich.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is likely the one that plays on this stereotype by stating it as if it were true, when the speaker might actually believe the opposite.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Only rich people can afford healthy food"
