    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and content of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - \"Yeah, he's clearly apathetic to earning minutes based on his lackluster play and the fact that he's grabbing hot dogs at half time.\"\n   - Analysis:\n     - The statement suggests that the person is not interested in earning playing time (\"apathetic\").\n     - The reasons given (\"lackluster play\" and \"grabbing hot dogs at half time\") support the claim of apathy.\n     - There is no contradiction or irony in the statement; it is straightforward and not sarcastic.\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - \"Yeah, he's clearly dedicated to earning minutes based on his lackluster play and the fact that he's grabbing hot dogs at half time.\"\n   - Analysis:\n     - The statement claims the person is \"dedicated to earning minutes.\"\n     - However, the reasons given (\"lackluster play\" and \"grabbing hot dogs at half time\") contradict the claim of dedication.\n     - The use of \"clearly\" adds an ironic tone, as the evidence provided does not support dedication.\n     - This contradiction and irony suggest sarcasm.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is sarcastic because it uses irony by stating the opposite of what the evidence suggests.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B)"
