    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is true or expected, often in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption (A): \"Bought the stock at $10.50 and sold at $100. Such profits being made\"\n- The person bought the stock at a low price ($10.50) and sold it at a much higher price ($100).\n- This transaction results in a profit, which aligns with the statement \"Such profits being made.\"\n- There is no contradiction or irony in this statement; it is straightforward and likely sincere.\n\nOption (B): \"Bought the stock at $1050 and sold at $100. Such profits being made\"\n- The person bought the stock at a high price ($1050) and sold it at a much lower price ($100).\n- This transaction results in a significant loss, not a profit.\n- The statement \"Such profits being made\" is contradictory to the actual outcome, as there is a loss instead of a profit.\n- This contradiction suggests sarcasm, as the statement is likely mocking the situation by implying the opposite of what is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to highlight the loss by stating the opposite, that profits were made.\n\n<<<B>>>"
