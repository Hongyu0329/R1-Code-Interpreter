    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the language used in each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It usually involves exaggeration or an absurd statement that is clearly not meant to be taken literally.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - \"Her wheel wobbling several millimeters in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe.\"\n   - The statement describes a wheel wobbling by a small amount (millimeters). This is a realistic and minor issue that might not necessarily indicate that a bike is unsafe. The statement seems straightforward and factual, without any exaggeration or irony.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - \"Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe.\"\n   - This statement describes a wheel wobbling by a large amount (feet). This is an exaggerated and absurd situation because a wheel wobbling several feet would clearly indicate a serious problem with the bike, making it unsafe. The statement implies the opposite of what is reasonable, suggesting sarcasm.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Option (A) uses a realistic measure (millimeters) and does not contain any exaggeration or irony, making it unlikely to be sarcastic.\n   - Option (B) uses an exaggerated measure (feet) that is clearly unreasonable, suggesting that the statement is sarcastic.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is sarcastic is Option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
