    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It usually involves a contrast between the literal meaning of the words and the intended meaning.\n\n2. **Context of the Statements**: Both statements involve a person who is about to go to college and expects to have little income. The topic is about tax breaks for students, which are financial benefits that can help reduce the financial burden on students.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Literal Meaning: The speaker is saying that removing tax breaks for students will be helpful.\n   - Contextual Understanding: Removing tax breaks would likely increase the financial burden on students, especially those with little income. Therefore, it is unlikely that removing tax breaks would genuinely be considered helpful.\n   - Implied Meaning: The speaker likely means the opposite of what is stated, suggesting that removing tax breaks would not be helpful. This contrast indicates sarcasm.\n\n4. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Literal Meaning: The speaker is saying that adding tax breaks for students will be helpful.\n   - Contextual Understanding: Adding tax breaks would indeed be helpful for students with little income, as it would reduce their financial burden.\n   - Implied Meaning: There is no contrast between the literal and intended meaning here; the statement is straightforward and likely genuine.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Option (A) is sarcastic because it presents a statement that is contrary to what would logically be considered helpful, given the context of a student with little income. The speaker is likely using sarcasm to criticize the idea of removing tax breaks.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) I'm headed to college within a year expecting barely any income during that time. Removing tax breaks for students will be helpful, right?"
