    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the language used in each option.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: \n   - Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often in a mocking or humorous way. It usually involves a contrast between the literal meaning of the words and the intended meaning.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option (A)**:\n   - Statement: \"He's a generous person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: The statement directly praises the person for being generous and highlights their involvement in a positive activity (promoting a charity stream).\n   - Intended Meaning: There is no apparent contradiction or irony in this statement. The literal meaning aligns with a positive view of the person's actions.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option (B)**:\n   - Statement: \"He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: The statement criticizes the person by calling them \"terrible,\" but then describes their involvement in a positive activity (promoting a charity stream).\n   - Intended Meaning: There is a clear contradiction between calling someone \"terrible\" and acknowledging their efforts in a charitable cause. This contrast suggests that the speaker might not genuinely believe the person is terrible, thus indicating sarcasm.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Option (B) contains a contradiction between the negative description of the person and the positive action they are involved in, which is a hallmark of sarcasm. The speaker likely does not truly believe the person is terrible, given the context of their charitable actions.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
