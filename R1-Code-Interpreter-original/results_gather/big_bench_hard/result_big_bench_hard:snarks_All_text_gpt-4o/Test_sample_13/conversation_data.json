    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical associations with the items mentioned in each statement.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often for humorous or emphatic effect. It often relies on context and common knowledge to convey the opposite meaning.\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (A)**: \"Everyone knows salt is the highlight of gourmet sophistication.\"\n   - **Literal Meaning**: This statement suggests that salt is considered the pinnacle of gourmet sophistication.\n   - **Common Knowledge**: Salt is a basic seasoning used in almost all cooking. While it is essential, it is not typically associated with gourmet sophistication, which is usually reserved for more luxurious or rare ingredients.\n   - **Potential Sarcasm**: Given that salt is a common and inexpensive ingredient, claiming it as the \"highlight of gourmet sophistication\" could be seen as sarcastic, implying the oppositeâ€”that salt is not sophisticated.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (B)**: \"Everyone knows caviar is the highlight of gourmet sophistication.\"\n   - **Literal Meaning**: This statement suggests that caviar is considered the pinnacle of gourmet sophistication.\n   - **Common Knowledge**: Caviar is a luxury food item, often associated with wealth and high-end dining. It is indeed considered a sophisticated and gourmet ingredient.\n   - **Potential Sarcasm**: Since caviar is genuinely associated with gourmet sophistication, this statement is likely not sarcastic. It aligns with common perceptions of caviar.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, statement (A) is likely sarcastic because it uses a common, everyday ingredient (salt) in a context that is typically reserved for luxury items, creating a contrast that suggests the opposite of the literal meaning. Statement (B) aligns with the common understanding of caviar as a sophisticated item, so it is not sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Everyone knows salt is the highlight of gourmet sophistication"
