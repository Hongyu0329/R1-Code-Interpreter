    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it okay\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** This statement suggests that making jokes or memes about racism is acceptable.\n   - **Sarcastic Interpretation:** The statement could be sarcastic if the speaker actually believes that making jokes about racism is not okay, and is using sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of claiming it is acceptable.\n   - **Analysis:** The phrase \"that's what keeps it okay\" could be interpreted as sarcastic because it implies that something inherently negative (racism) is being trivialized or justified through humor, which is often not genuinely acceptable.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** This statement suggests that making jokes or memes about racism contributes to its harmfulness.\n   - **Sarcastic Interpretation:** The statement is less likely to be sarcastic because it directly acknowledges the negative impact of making jokes about racism.\n   - **Analysis:** The phrase \"that's what keeps it toxic\" aligns with the understanding that racism is harmful, and making light of it through memes perpetuates its toxicity. This statement is more straightforward and less likely to be sarcastic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an absurd justification for something that is generally considered unacceptable, using irony to critique the trivialization of racism.\n- Option (B) is more straightforward and aligns with a genuine critique of the issue, making it less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
