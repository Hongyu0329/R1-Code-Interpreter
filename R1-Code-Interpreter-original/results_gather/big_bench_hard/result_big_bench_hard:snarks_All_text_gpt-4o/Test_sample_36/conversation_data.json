    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually to mock or convey contempt.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement A:** \"Hey genocide is clearly the most rational decision.\"\n   - **Statement B:** \"Hey compromise is clearly the most rational decision.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement A:**\n   - Genocide is a term that refers to the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group. It is widely considered a heinous and irrational act.\n   - Describing genocide as \"the most rational decision\" is contradictory because genocide is inherently irrational and morally wrong.\n   - Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic, as it uses irony to highlight the absurdity of considering genocide rational.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement B:**\n   - Compromise is generally seen as a rational and constructive approach to resolving conflicts.\n   - Describing compromise as \"the most rational decision\" aligns with common understanding and does not contain inherent irony or contradiction.\n   - Therefore, this statement is likely not sarcastic, as it straightforwardly aligns with the typical view of compromise.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Statement A uses irony by calling an irrational and morally reprehensible act \"rational,\" which is a hallmark of sarcasm.\n   - Statement B straightforwardly describes compromise as rational, which is consistent with common beliefs and lacks sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
