    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the underlying implications of each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"But America is a more free country because they have democracy to protect them from that sort of tyranny.\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** This statement suggests that America is free because democracy inherently protects against tyranny. \n   - **Contextual Analysis:** Democracy is generally seen as a system that provides checks and balances against tyranny, so this statement aligns with common beliefs about democracy.\n   - **Sarcasm Check:** There is no obvious contradiction or irony in this statement. It seems to be a straightforward assertion rather than a sarcastic one.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"But America is a more free country because they have guns to protect them from that sort of tyranny.\"\n   - **Literal Interpretation:** This statement suggests that guns are the reason America is free and protected from tyranny.\n   - **Contextual Analysis:** The idea that guns protect against tyranny is a contentious and debated topic. Some people believe that an armed populace can deter government overreach, while others argue that this is an oversimplification and not a reliable safeguard.\n   - **Sarcasm Check:** The statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is mocking the notion that guns alone can protect against tyranny, especially if they believe that other factors (like democracy, laws, and institutions) are more critical. The use of \"more free\" could also imply an exaggeration, hinting at sarcasm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Statement (A) aligns with a common belief about democracy and does not contain obvious sarcasm.\n- Statement (B) could be sarcastic if the speaker is critiquing or mocking the idea that guns are the primary or sole protectors against tyranny.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
