    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to understand the nature of sarcasm. Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they truly mean, often for humorous or emphatic effect.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption (A): \"This website is well known to post falsehoods and spread false rumors. Rock-solid source if you ask me.\"\n- The first sentence states that the website is known for posting falsehoods and spreading false rumors.\n- The second sentence, \"Rock-solid source if you ask me,\" is the opposite of what one would logically conclude from the first sentence. A website known for falsehoods would not be considered a \"rock-solid source.\"\n- This contradiction suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic. They don't actually believe the website is a reliable source; they are using irony to emphasize its unreliability.\n\nOption (B): \"This website is well known to post falsehoods and spread false rumors. Suspicious source if you ask me.\"\n- The first sentence is the same as in option (A), stating that the website is known for falsehoods and rumors.\n- The second sentence, \"Suspicious source if you ask me,\" aligns with the logical conclusion one would draw from the first sentence. A website known for falsehoods would indeed be considered suspicious.\n- There is no contradiction or irony here, so this statement is not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is literally stated.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
