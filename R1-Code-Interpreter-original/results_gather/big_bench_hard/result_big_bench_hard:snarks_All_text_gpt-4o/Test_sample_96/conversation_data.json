    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"They're losing to a team with a terrible record. I for one am shocked.\"\n   - **Context:** The team is losing to another team that has a terrible record.\n   - **Language Analysis:** The phrase \"I for one am shocked\" suggests that the speaker is expressing surprise. However, losing to a team with a terrible record is generally not surprising; it is expected that a team with a better record should win. Therefore, the statement \"I for one am shocked\" is likely sarcastic because the speaker is pretending to be surprised about something that is actually not surprising.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"They're losing to a team with a winning record. I for one am shocked.\"\n   - **Context:** The team is losing to another team that has a winning record.\n   - **Language Analysis:** In this case, losing to a team with a winning record is not unexpected. It is reasonable to expect that a team with a winning record might win against a team with a lesser record. Therefore, the statement \"I for one am shocked\" could be interpreted as genuine surprise, but it is less likely to be sarcastic because the situation described is not inherently surprising.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because the speaker is expressing mock surprise about a situation that is not surprising (losing to a team with a terrible record).\n- Option (B) is less likely to be sarcastic because the situation described (losing to a team with a winning record) is not inherently surprising, and the expression of surprise could be genuine.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) They're losing to a team with a terrible record. I for one am shocked"
