    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given data and apply the conditions specified in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Data:**\n   - We have a table with four penguins, each with attributes: name, age, height, and weight.\n   - The data is as follows:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Identify the Conditions:**\n   - We need to find penguins who are:\n     - Less than 8 years old\n     - Weigh less than 12 kg\n\n3. **Apply the Conditions to Each Penguin:**\n   - **Louis:**\n     - Age: 7 (less than 8)\n     - Weight: 11 kg (less than 12)\n     - Louis meets both conditions.\n   - **Bernard:**\n     - Age: 5 (less than 8)\n     - Weight: 13 kg (not less than 12)\n     - Bernard does not meet the weight condition.\n   - **Vincent:**\n     - Age: 9 (not less than 8)\n     - Weight: 11 kg (less than 12)\n     - Vincent does not meet the age condition.\n   - **Gwen:**\n     - Age: 8 (not less than 8)\n     - Weight: 15 kg (not less than 12)\n     - Gwen does not meet either condition.\n\n4. **Count the Penguins Meeting Both Conditions:**\n   - Only Louis meets both conditions of being less than 8 years old and weighing less than 12 kg.\n\n5. **Determine the Answer:**\n   - Based on the analysis, there is only 1 penguin that meets both conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<A>>>."
