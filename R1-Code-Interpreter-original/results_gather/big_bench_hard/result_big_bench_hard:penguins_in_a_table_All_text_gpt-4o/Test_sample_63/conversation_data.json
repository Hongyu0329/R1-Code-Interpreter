    "To determine how many penguins are less than 10 years old, we need to analyze the age of each penguin listed in the table. Let's go through the data step by step:\n\n1. **Louis**: Age is 7.\n2. **Bernard**: Age is 5.\n3. **Vincent**: Age is 9.\n4. **Gwen**: Age is 8.\n\nNext, we need to count how many of these penguins have an age less than 10:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is less than 10.\n- Bernard is 5 years old, which is less than 10.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is less than 10.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is less than 10.\n\nAll four penguins are less than 10 years old.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins less than 10 years old is 4.\n\nThe correct option is (D) 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<D>>>."
