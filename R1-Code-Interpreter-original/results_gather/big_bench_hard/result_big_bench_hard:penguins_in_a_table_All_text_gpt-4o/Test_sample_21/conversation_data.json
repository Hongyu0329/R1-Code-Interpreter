    "To find the cumulated weight of the penguins, we need to sum up the weights of all the penguins listed in the table, including the newly added penguin, James.\n\n1. **Identify the weights of each penguin:**\n   - Louis: 11 kg\n   - Bernard: 13 kg\n   - Vincent: 11 kg\n   - Gwen: 15 kg\n   - James: 12 kg\n\n2. **Calculate the total weight:**\n   - Add the weights together: 11 + 13 + 11 + 15 + 12\n\n3. **Perform the addition:**\n   - 11 + 13 = 24\n   - 24 + 11 = 35\n   - 35 + 15 = 50\n   - 50 + 12 = 62\n\n4. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - Double-check each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Match the result with the given options:**\n   - The calculated total weight is 62 kg.\n\nTherefore, the cumulated weight of the penguins is 62 kg.\n\nThe final answer is <<<D>>>."
