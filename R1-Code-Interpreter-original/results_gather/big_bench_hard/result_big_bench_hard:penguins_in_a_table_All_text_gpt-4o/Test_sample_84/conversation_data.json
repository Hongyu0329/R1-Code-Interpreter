    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total age of all the penguins and giraffes listed in the tables. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Extract the ages of the penguins:**\n   - Louis: 7 years\n   - Bernard: 5 years\n   - Vincent: 9 years\n   - Gwen: 8 years\n\n2. **Calculate the total age of the penguins:**\n   - Total age of penguins = 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 = 29 years\n\n3. **Extract the ages of the giraffes:**\n   - Jody: 5 years\n   - Gladys: 10 years\n   - Marian: 2 years\n   - Donna: 9 years\n\n4. **Calculate the total age of the giraffes:**\n   - Total age of giraffes = 5 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 26 years\n\n5. **Calculate the cumulated age of both penguins and giraffes:**\n   - Cumulated age = Total age of penguins + Total age of giraffes\n   - Cumulated age = 29 + 26 = 55 years\n\n6. **Match the cumulated age with the given options:**\n   - The correct option is (D) 55.\n\nTherefore, the cumulated age of the penguins and giraffes is:\n\n<<<55>>>"
