    "To find the average height of the penguins, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the heights of all penguins:**\n   - Louis: 50 cm\n   - Bernard: 80 cm\n   - Vincent: 60 cm\n   - Gwen: 70 cm\n   - James: 90 cm\n\n2. **Calculate the total height:**\n   - Total height = 50 + 80 + 60 + 70 + 90\n\n3. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Total height = 350 cm\n\n4. **Count the number of penguins:**\n   - There are 5 penguins in total (Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, James).\n\n5. **Calculate the average height:**\n   - Average height = Total height / Number of penguins\n   - Average height = 350 cm / 5\n\n6. **Perform the division:**\n   - Average height = 70 cm\n\n7. **Match the calculated average height with the given options:**\n   - The calculated average height is 70 cm, which corresponds to option (C).\n\nTherefore, the average height of the penguins is 70 cm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
