    "To determine how many animals are listed in the tables, we need to count the number of entries in each table.\n\n1. **Penguin Table Analysis:**\n   - The table lists the following penguins:\n     - Louis\n     - Bernard\n     - Vincent\n     - Gwen\n   - Total number of penguins: 4\n\n2. **Giraffe Table Analysis:**\n   - The table lists the following giraffes:\n     - Jody\n     - Gladys\n     - Marian\n     - Donna\n   - Total number of giraffes: 4\n\n3. **Total Number of Animals:**\n   - Add the number of penguins and giraffes together:\n     - Total animals = Number of penguins + Number of giraffes\n     - Total animals = 4 (penguins) + 4 (giraffes) = 8\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals listed in the tables is 8.\n\nFinal answer: <<<D>>>."
