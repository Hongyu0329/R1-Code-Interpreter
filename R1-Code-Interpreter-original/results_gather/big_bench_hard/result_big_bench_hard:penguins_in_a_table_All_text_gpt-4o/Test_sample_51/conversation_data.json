    "To determine which penguin is the shortest, we need to analyze the height of each penguin listed in the table. Let's go through the information step by step:\n\n1. **Extract the relevant data from the table:**\n   - Louis: height = 50 cm\n   - Bernard: height = 80 cm\n   - Vincent: height = 60 cm\n   - Gwen: height = 70 cm\n\n2. **Compare the heights:**\n   - Louis: 50 cm\n   - Bernard: 80 cm\n   - Vincent: 60 cm\n   - Gwen: 70 cm\n\n3. **Identify the shortest height:**\n   - The shortest height among the penguins is 50 cm.\n\n4. **Determine which penguin has this height:**\n   - Louis is the penguin with a height of 50 cm.\n\n5. **Check the options provided:**\n   - (A) Louis\n   - (B) Bernard\n   - (C) Vincent\n   - (D) Gwen\n   - (E) James\n\n6. **Select the correct option:**\n   - The shortest penguin is Louis, which corresponds to option (A).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
