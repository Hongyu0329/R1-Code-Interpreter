    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the ages of the penguins listed in the table and compare them to find which penguin is younger than Vincent and older than Louis.\n\n1. **Extract the ages from the table:**\n   - Louis: 7 years old\n   - Bernard: 5 years old\n   - Vincent: 9 years old\n   - Gwen: 8 years old\n\n2. **Understand the age criteria:**\n   - We are looking for a penguin whose age is less than Vincent's age (9 years) and more than Louis's age (7 years).\n\n3. **Compare each penguin's age with the criteria:**\n   - **Louis:** 7 years old. Not older than Louis.\n   - **Bernard:** 5 years old. Younger than Louis.\n   - **Vincent:** 9 years old. This is the reference age, not a candidate.\n   - **Gwen:** 8 years old. Older than Louis (7 years) and younger than Vincent (9 years).\n\n4. **Check the options provided:**\n   - (A) Louis: Not a candidate as he is not older than himself.\n   - (B) Bernard: Not a candidate as he is younger than Louis.\n   - (C) Vincent: Not a candidate as he is the reference age.\n   - (D) Gwen: Matches the criteria.\n   - (E) James: Not listed in the table, so not a candidate.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The penguin that is younger than Vincent and older than Louis is Gwen.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
