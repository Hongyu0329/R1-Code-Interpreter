    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data and perform the specified operations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Table Analysis:**\n   - We have a table with the following penguins:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Adding a New Penguin:**\n   - We add a new penguin named James with the following attributes:\n     - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n3. **Deleting a Penguin:**\n   - We delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n\n4. **Updated Table:**\n   - After adding James and deleting Bernard, the table now consists of:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n     - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n5. **Criteria for Selection:**\n   - We need to find penguins who are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.\n\n6. **Checking Each Penguin:**\n   - **Louis:** age 7, weight 11 kg\n     - Louis is less than 8 years old and weighs less than 12 kg. (Meets both criteria)\n   - **Vincent:** age 9, weight 11 kg\n     - Vincent is not less than 8 years old. (Does not meet the age criterion)\n   - **Gwen:** age 8, weight 15 kg\n     - Gwen is not less than 8 years old and does not weigh less than 12 kg. (Does not meet either criterion)\n   - **James:** age 12, weight 12 kg\n     - James is not less than 8 years old and does not weigh less than 12 kg. (Does not meet either criterion)\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only Louis meets both criteria of being less than 8 years old and weighing less than 12 kg.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins that meet the criteria is 1.\n\nFinal answer: <<<A>>>."
