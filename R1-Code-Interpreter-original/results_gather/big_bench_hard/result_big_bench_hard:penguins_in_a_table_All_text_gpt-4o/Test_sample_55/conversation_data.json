    "To determine how many columns are in the table, we need to analyze the structure of the data provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Header**: The first line of the table is the header, which lists the categories of data for each penguin. The header is: \"name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\".\n\n2. **Count the Categories in the Header**: The header lists the following categories:\n   - Name\n   - Age\n   - Height (cm)\n   - Weight (kg)\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Columns**: Each category in the header represents a column in the table. Therefore, the number of columns is equal to the number of categories listed in the header.\n\n4. **Count the Columns**: There are four categories listed in the header, which means there are four columns in the table.\n\n5. **Verify with Data**: Each line of data for the penguins corresponds to these four categories:\n   - Louis: 7, 50, 11\n   - Bernard: 5, 80, 13\n   - Vincent: 9, 60, 11\n   - Gwen: 8, 70, 15\n\n   Each penguin's data is organized into four pieces of information, matching the four columns identified in the header.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The table has four columns.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D) 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
