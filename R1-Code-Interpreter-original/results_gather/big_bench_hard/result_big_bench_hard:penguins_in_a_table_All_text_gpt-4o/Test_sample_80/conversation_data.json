    "To determine the name of the last animal, we need to carefully analyze the given tables and the question.\n\n1. **Understand the Structure of the Tables:**\n   - The first table lists penguins with their respective attributes: name, age, height, and weight.\n   - The second table lists giraffes with the same attributes.\n\n2. **Identify the Last Animal in Each Table:**\n   - In the penguin table, the last entry is \"Gwen, 8, 70, 15\".\n   - In the giraffe table, the last entry is \"Donna, 9, 440, 650\".\n\n3. **Determine the Last Animal Overall:**\n   - The question asks for the name of the last animal, which implies the last entry in the entire list of animals, combining both tables.\n   - Since the giraffe table is listed after the penguin table, the last animal overall is the last entry in the giraffe table.\n\n4. **Identify the Name of the Last Animal:**\n   - The last entry in the giraffe table is \"Donna, 9, 440, 650\".\n   - Therefore, the name of the last animal is \"Donna\".\n\n5. **Match the Name with the Given Options:**\n   - The options provided are:\n     (A) Bernard\n     (B) Donna\n     (C) Gladys\n     (D) Gwen\n     (E) James\n   - The name \"Donna\" corresponds to option (B).\n\nBased on the analysis, the name of the last animal is \"Donna\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<Donna>>>."
