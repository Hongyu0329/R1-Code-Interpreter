    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Table**: \n   - The table initially contains the following penguins:\n     - Louis, 7, 50, 11\n     - Bernard, 5, 80, 13\n     - Vincent, 9, 60, 11\n     - Gwen, 8, 70, 15\n\n2. **Add a New Penguin**:\n   - We add a new penguin to the table:\n     - James, 12, 90, 12\n\n3. **Delete a Penguin**:\n   - We delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n\n4. **Current Table After Modifications**:\n   - After adding James and removing Bernard, the table now contains:\n     - Louis, 7, 50, 11\n     - Vincent, 9, 60, 11\n     - Gwen, 8, 70, 15\n     - James, 12, 90, 12\n\n5. **Sort the Penguins by Name**:\n   - We need to sort the remaining penguins alphabetically by their names:\n     - Gwen\n     - James\n     - Louis\n     - Vincent\n\n6. **Identify the First Penguin in Alphabetical Order**:\n   - The first penguin in alphabetical order is Gwen.\n\nTherefore, the name of the first penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gwen>>>."
