    "To find the cumulated age of the giraffes, we need to add up the ages of all the giraffes listed in the table. Let's analyze the data step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the ages of each giraffe:**\n   - Jody is 5 years old.\n   - Gladys is 10 years old.\n   - Marian is 2 years old.\n   - Donna is 9 years old.\n\n2. **Add the ages together:**\n   - Start with Jody's age: 5\n   - Add Gladys's age: 5 + 10 = 15\n   - Add Marian's age: 15 + 2 = 17\n   - Add Donna's age: 17 + 9 = 26\n\n3. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - Re-check each addition step to ensure accuracy:\n     - 5 + 10 = 15\n     - 15 + 2 = 17\n     - 17 + 9 = 26\n\n4. **Compare the result with the given options:**\n   - The calculated cumulated age of the giraffes is 26.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A) 26.\n\nFinal answer: <<<A>>>."
