    "To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: The table consists of four columns: name, age, height (cm), and weight (kg). Each row after the header represents a penguin with its respective attributes.\n\n2. **Identify the Penguins and Their Ages**:\n   - Louis: Age 7\n   - Bernard: Age 5\n   - Vincent: Age 9\n   - Gwen: Age 8\n\n3. **Remove Bernard from the Table**: According to the problem, Bernard is deleted from the table. Therefore, we will not include Bernard's age in our calculations.\n\n4. **Calculate the Cumulated Age of the Remaining Penguins**:\n   - Louis: Age 7\n   - Vincent: Age 9\n   - Gwen: Age 8\n\n5. **Sum the Ages of the Remaining Penguins**:\n   - Louis's age: 7\n   - Vincent's age: 9\n   - Gwen's age: 8\n\n   Cumulated age = 7 + 9 + 8 = 24\n\n6. **Select the Correct Option**: From the given options, we need to find the one that matches our calculated cumulated age.\n\nThe options are:\n- (A) 24\n- (B) 29\n- (C) 36\n- (D) 41\n- (E) 48\n\nThe correct answer is option (A) 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<24>>>"
