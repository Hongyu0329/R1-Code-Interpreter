    "To find the cumulated age of the animals, we need to sum the ages of all the penguins and giraffes listed in the tables.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the penguin table.**\n- Louis: age 7\n- Bernard: age 5\n- Vincent: age 9\n- Gwen: age 8\n- James: age 12\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total age of the penguins.**\n- Total age of penguins = 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 12 = 41\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the giraffe table.**\n- Jody: age 5\n- Gladys: age 10\n- Marian: age 2\n- Donna: age 9\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total age of the giraffes.**\n- Total age of giraffes = 5 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 26\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the cumulated age of all animals.**\n- Cumulated age = Total age of penguins + Total age of giraffes\n- Cumulated age = 41 + 26 = 67\n\n**Step 6: Match the cumulated age with the given options.**\n- The cumulated age of the animals is 67, which corresponds to option (E).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
