    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many animals from both tables are more than 5 years old. We will analyze each table separately and then combine the results.\n\n**Penguin Table Analysis:**\n\n1. **Louis**: Age is 7, which is more than 5.\n2. **Bernard**: Age is 5, which is not more than 5.\n3. **Vincent**: Age is 9, which is more than 5.\n4. **Gwen**: Age is 8, which is more than 5.\n\nFrom the penguin table, the animals more than 5 years old are Louis, Vincent, and Gwen. This gives us a total of 3 penguins.\n\n**Giraffe Table Analysis:**\n\n1. **Jody**: Age is 5, which is not more than 5.\n2. **Gladys**: Age is 10, which is more than 5.\n3. **Marian**: Age is 2, which is not more than 5.\n4. **Donna**: Age is 9, which is more than 5.\n\nFrom the giraffe table, the animals more than 5 years old are Gladys and Donna. This gives us a total of 2 giraffes.\n\n**Combining Results:**\n\n- Penguins more than 5 years old: 3\n- Giraffes more than 5 years old: 2\n\nTotal animals more than 5 years old = 3 (penguins) + 2 (giraffes) = 5\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals more than 5 years old is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<5>>>"
