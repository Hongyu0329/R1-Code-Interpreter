    "To determine the age of Bernard, we need to carefully analyze the given table and extract the relevant information. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table consists of a header and four rows, each representing a penguin with their respective attributes: name, age, height, and weight.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Row**:\n   - We are interested in finding the age of Bernard. Therefore, we need to locate the row corresponding to Bernard.\n\n3. **Extract Bernard's Information**:\n   - From the table, Bernard's row is: \"Bernard, 5, 80, 13\".\n   - This row indicates that Bernard's age is 5.\n\n4. **Verify the Information**:\n   - Double-check the extracted information to ensure accuracy. The row clearly states Bernard's age as 5.\n\n5. **Match with the Options**:\n   - Compare the extracted age with the provided options:\n     - (A) 7\n     - (B) 5\n     - (C) 9\n     - (D) 8\n     - (E) 12\n   - The correct option that matches Bernard's age is (B) 5.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the age of Bernard.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>."
