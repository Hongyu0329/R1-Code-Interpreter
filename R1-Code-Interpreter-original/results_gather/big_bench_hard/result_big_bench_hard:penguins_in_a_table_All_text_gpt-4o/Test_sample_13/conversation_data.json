    "To determine how many giraffes are in the tables, we need to carefully analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Penguin Table Analysis:**\n   - The penguin table initially contains four penguins: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.\n   - A new penguin, James, is added to the table.\n   - The penguin table now has a total of five penguins.\n\n2. **Giraffe Table Analysis:**\n   - The giraffe table lists four giraffes: Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna.\n   - There is no mention of adding or removing any giraffes from this table.\n\n3. **Question Focus:**\n   - The question specifically asks about the number of giraffes in the tables.\n   - We need to focus only on the giraffe table for this count.\n\n4. **Counting Giraffes:**\n   - From the giraffe table, we have the following giraffes: Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna.\n   - This gives us a total of four giraffes.\n\n5. **Options Analysis:**\n   - We compare the count of giraffes (4) with the provided options:\n     - (A) 1\n     - (B) 2\n     - (C) 3\n     - (D) 4\n     - (E) 5\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The correct option that matches the count of giraffes is (D) 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
