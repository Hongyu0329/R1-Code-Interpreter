    "To determine how many giraffes are listed in the tables, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the giraffe table. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Table for Giraffes:**\n   - The table for giraffes is clearly separated from the table for penguins. It starts with the header: \"name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\" and lists the following entries:\n     - Jody, 5, 430, 620\n     - Gladys, 10, 420, 590\n     - Marian, 2, 310, 410\n     - Donna, 9, 440, 650\n\n2. **Count the Number of Giraffes:**\n   - Each line after the header represents one giraffe.\n   - Count the number of lines (or entries) in the giraffe table:\n     - Jody\n     - Gladys\n     - Marian\n     - Donna\n   - There are 4 entries in total.\n\n3. **Verify the Options:**\n   - The options provided are:\n     - (A) 1\n     - (B) 2\n     - (C) 3\n     - (D) 4\n     - (E) 5\n   - Based on our count, the correct number of giraffes is 4.\n\n4. **Select the Correct Option:**\n   - The correct option that matches our count is (D) 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
