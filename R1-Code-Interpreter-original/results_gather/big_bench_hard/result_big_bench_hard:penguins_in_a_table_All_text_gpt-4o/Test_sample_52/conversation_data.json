    "To determine which penguin is less than 7 years old, we need to analyze the age of each penguin listed in the table. Let's go through the information step by step:\n\n1. **Louis**: Age is 7.\n2. **Bernard**: Age is 5.\n3. **Vincent**: Age is 9.\n4. **Gwen**: Age is 8.\n\nNow, let's compare each penguin's age to 7:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is not less than 7.\n- Bernard is 5 years old, which is less than 7.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is not less than 7.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is not less than 7.\n\nFrom the analysis, Bernard is the only penguin whose age is less than 7.\n\nThe options provided are:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\n\nSince Bernard is the only penguin less than 7 years old, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<Bernard>>>"
