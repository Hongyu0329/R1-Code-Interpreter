    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given in the table and compare the ages of the penguins to determine which one is older than Gwen.\n\n1. **Extract Information from the Table:**\n   - Louis: Age = 7\n   - Bernard: Age = 5\n   - Vincent: Age = 9\n   - Gwen: Age = 8\n\n2. **Understand the Question:**\n   - We need to find which penguin is older than Gwen.\n   - Gwen's age is 8.\n\n3. **Compare Ages:**\n   - Louis is 7 years old, which is not older than Gwen (8 years old).\n   - Bernard is 5 years old, which is not older than Gwen (8 years old).\n   - Vincent is 9 years old, which is older than Gwen (8 years old).\n\n4. **Check the Options:**\n   - (A) Louis: 7 years old, not older than Gwen.\n   - (B) Bernard: 5 years old, not older than Gwen.\n   - (C) Vincent: 9 years old, older than Gwen.\n   - (D) Gwen: 8 years old, not older than herself.\n   - (E) James: Not mentioned in the table, so no age information is available.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only penguin older than Gwen is Vincent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<C>>>."
