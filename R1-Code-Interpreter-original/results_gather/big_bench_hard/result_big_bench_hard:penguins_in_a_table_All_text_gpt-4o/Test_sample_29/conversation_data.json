    "To determine the name of the last giraffe, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the giraffe table. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Giraffe Table**: The table for giraffes is clearly marked and separate from the penguin table. It includes the following entries:\n   - Jody, 5, 430, 620\n   - Gladys, 10, 420, 590\n   - Marian, 2, 310, 410\n   - Donna, 9, 440, 650\n\n2. **Determine the Last Entry**: The last entry in the giraffe table is the one that appears at the bottom of the list. In this case, the last giraffe listed is:\n   - Donna, 9, 440, 650\n\n3. **Identify the Name**: The name of the last giraffe, based on the last entry, is \"Donna.\"\n\n4. **Match with Options**: We need to match the name \"Donna\" with the given options:\n   - (A) Jody\n   - (B) Gladys\n   - (C) Marian\n   - (D) Donna\n   - (E) Louise\n\n5. **Select the Correct Option**: The correct option that matches the name of the last giraffe is (D) Donna.\n\nTherefore, the name of the last giraffe is:\n\n<<<Donna>>>"
