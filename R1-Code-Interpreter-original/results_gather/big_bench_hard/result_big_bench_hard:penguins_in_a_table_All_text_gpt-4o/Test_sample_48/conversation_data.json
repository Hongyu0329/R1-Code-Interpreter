    "To find the cumulated age of the penguins, we need to sum the ages of all the penguins listed in the table, including the newly added penguin, James.\n\n1. **Identify the ages of the original penguins:**\n   - Louis: 7 years\n   - Bernard: 5 years\n   - Vincent: 9 years\n   - Gwen: 8 years\n\n2. **Add the age of the new penguin:**\n   - James: 12 years\n\n3. **Calculate the total age:**\n   - Sum the ages: 7 (Louis) + 5 (Bernard) + 9 (Vincent) + 8 (Gwen) + 12 (James)\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n   - 7 + 5 = 12\n   - 12 + 9 = 21\n   - 21 + 8 = 29\n   - 29 + 12 = 41\n\n5. **Verify the options:**\n   - The calculated total age is 41, which matches option (D).\n\nTherefore, the cumulated age of the penguins is 41.\n\n<<<D>>>"
