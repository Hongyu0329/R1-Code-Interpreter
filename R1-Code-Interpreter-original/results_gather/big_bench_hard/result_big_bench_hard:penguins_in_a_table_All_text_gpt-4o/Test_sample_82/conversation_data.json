    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Table**: \n   - The table initially contains the following penguins:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Add a New Penguin**:\n   - We add a new penguin named James with the following details:\n     - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n3. **Delete a Penguin**:\n   - We delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n\n4. **Calculate the Cumulated Weight**:\n   - After deleting Bernard, the remaining penguins are:\n     - Louis: weight 11 kg\n     - Vincent: weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: weight 15 kg\n     - James: weight 12 kg\n   - Calculate the total weight by summing the weights of the remaining penguins:\n     - Total weight = 11 kg (Louis) + 11 kg (Vincent) + 15 kg (Gwen) + 12 kg (James)\n     - Total weight = 49 kg\n\n5. **Select the Correct Option**:\n   - The cumulated weight of the penguins is 49 kg, which corresponds to option (B).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
