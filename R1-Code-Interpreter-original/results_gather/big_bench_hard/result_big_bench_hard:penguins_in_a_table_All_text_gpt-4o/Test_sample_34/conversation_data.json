    "To determine how many species are listed in the table, we need to carefully analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table**: The table contains information about penguins, with each line representing a penguin's name, age, height, and weight.\n\n2. **Identifying Species**: The question asks about the number of species. However, the table only provides names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins, without any explicit mention of species.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Data**: \n   - The names listed are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.\n   - Each penguin has different attributes (age, height, weight), but there is no indication that these attributes correspond to different species.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the table does not provide any information about different species and only lists individual penguins with their respective attributes, we must assume that all penguins belong to the same species.\n\n5. **Answering the Question**: Based on the information given, there is no evidence of multiple species. Therefore, the number of species listed in the table is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<A>>>."
