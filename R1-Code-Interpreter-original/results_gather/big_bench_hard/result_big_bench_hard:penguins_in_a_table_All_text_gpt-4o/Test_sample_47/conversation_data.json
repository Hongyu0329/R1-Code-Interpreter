    "To determine how many penguins are in the tables, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the penguin table.\n\n1. **Identify the Header and Data Rows:**\n   - The first line of the penguin table is the header: \"name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\".\n   - Each subsequent line represents a penguin with its respective details.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Penguins:**\n   - The penguin table lists the following penguins:\n     - Louis\n     - Bernard\n     - Vincent\n     - Gwen\n   - Each of these names corresponds to a separate line in the table, indicating a separate penguin.\n\n3. **Verify the Count:**\n   - We have four lines of data for penguins, each representing a different penguin.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are 4 penguins listed in the table.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins in the tables is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<D>>>."
