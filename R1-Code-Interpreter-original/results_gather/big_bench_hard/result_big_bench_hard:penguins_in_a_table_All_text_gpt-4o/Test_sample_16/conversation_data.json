    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the table of giraffes and determine how many of them are more than 5 years old. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table lists giraffes with their respective attributes: name, age, height (cm), and weight (kg).\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Attribute**:\n   - We are interested in the \"age\" attribute to determine which giraffes are more than 5 years old.\n\n3. **List the Giraffes and Their Ages**:\n   - Jody: 5 years old\n   - Gladys: 10 years old\n   - Marian: 2 years old\n   - Donna: 9 years old\n\n4. **Determine Which Giraffes Are More Than 5 Years Old**:\n   - Jody is 5 years old, which is not more than 5.\n   - Gladys is 10 years old, which is more than 5.\n   - Marian is 2 years old, which is not more than 5.\n   - Donna is 9 years old, which is more than 5.\n\n5. **Count the Giraffes More Than 5 Years Old**:\n   - Gladys and Donna are the only giraffes more than 5 years old.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total**:\n   - There are 2 giraffes (Gladys and Donna) who are more than 5 years old.\n\n7. **Select the Correct Option**:\n   - The correct option that corresponds to 2 giraffes is (B) 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
