    "To find the cumulated age of the penguins, we need to add up the ages of all the penguins listed in the table. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the ages of each penguin:**\n   - Louis: 7 years old\n   - Bernard: 5 years old\n   - Vincent: 9 years old\n   - Gwen: 8 years old\n   - James: 12 years old (added later)\n\n2. **Add the ages together:**\n   - Start with Louis: 7\n   - Add Bernard's age: 7 + 5 = 12\n   - Add Vincent's age: 12 + 9 = 21\n   - Add Gwen's age: 21 + 8 = 29\n   - Add James's age: 29 + 12 = 41\n\n3. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - Re-check each step to ensure no mistakes were made in addition.\n\nThe cumulated age of the penguins is 41.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) 41.\n\nFinal answer: <<<41>>>."
