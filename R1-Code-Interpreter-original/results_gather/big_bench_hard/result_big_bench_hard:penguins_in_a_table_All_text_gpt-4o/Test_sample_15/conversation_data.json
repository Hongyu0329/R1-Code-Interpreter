    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data and follow the steps outlined in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Table Analysis:**\n   - We have a table with the following penguins:\n     - Louis: Age 7, Height 50 cm, Weight 11 kg\n     - Bernard: Age 5, Height 80 cm, Weight 13 kg\n     - Vincent: Age 9, Height 60 cm, Weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: Age 8, Height 70 cm, Weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Adding a New Penguin:**\n   - We add a new penguin named James with the following details:\n     - James: Age 12, Height 90 cm, Weight 12 kg\n\n3. **Deleting a Penguin:**\n   - We delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n\n4. **Updated Table:**\n   - After adding James and deleting Bernard, the table now includes:\n     - Louis: Age 7, Height 50 cm, Weight 11 kg\n     - Vincent: Age 9, Height 60 cm, Weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: Age 8, Height 70 cm, Weight 15 kg\n     - James: Age 12, Height 90 cm, Weight 12 kg\n\n5. **Condition Analysis:**\n   - We need to find the number of penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.\n\n6. **Checking Each Penguin:**\n   - Louis: Age 7 (more than 5), Weight 11 kg (not more than 12) → Does not meet both conditions.\n   - Vincent: Age 9 (more than 5), Weight 11 kg (not more than 12) → Does not meet both conditions.\n   - Gwen: Age 8 (more than 5), Weight 15 kg (more than 12) → Meets both conditions.\n   - James: Age 12 (more than 5), Weight 12 kg (not more than 12) → Does not meet both conditions.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only Gwen meets both conditions of being more than 5 years old and weighing more than 12 kg.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins that meet the criteria is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<A>>>."
