    "To determine how many animals are listed in the table, we need to carefully analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Initial Table Analysis:**\n   - The table initially contains the following penguins:\n     - Louis\n     - Bernard\n     - Vincent\n     - Gwen\n   - This gives us a total of 4 penguins initially.\n\n2. **Addition of a New Penguin:**\n   - A new penguin named James is added to the table.\n   - This increases the total number of penguins by 1.\n\n3. **Final Count:**\n   - Initially, there were 4 penguins.\n   - With the addition of James, the total number of penguins becomes 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals listed in the table is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is: <<<E>>>."
