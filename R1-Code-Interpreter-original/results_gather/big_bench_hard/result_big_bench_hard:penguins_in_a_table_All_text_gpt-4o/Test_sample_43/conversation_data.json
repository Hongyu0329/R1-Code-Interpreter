    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many animals (both penguins and giraffes) are more than 5 years old. We will analyze each table separately and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the penguin table**\n\nThe penguin table, including the newly added penguin, is as follows:\n\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Bernard: 5 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n- James: 12 years old\n\nWe need to count the penguins that are more than 5 years old:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Bernard is 5 years old, which is not more than 5.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is more than 5.\n- James is 12 years old, which is more than 5.\n\nSo, there are 4 penguins more than 5 years old.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the giraffe table**\n\nThe giraffe table is as follows:\n\n- Jody: 5 years old\n- Gladys: 10 years old\n- Marian: 2 years old\n- Donna: 9 years old\n\nWe need to count the giraffes that are more than 5 years old:\n\n- Jody is 5 years old, which is not more than 5.\n- Gladys is 10 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Marian is 2 years old, which is not more than 5.\n- Donna is 9 years old, which is more than 5.\n\nSo, there are 2 giraffes more than 5 years old.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results**\n\nNow, we combine the counts from both tables:\n\n- Penguins more than 5 years old: 4\n- Giraffes more than 5 years old: 2\n\nTotal animals more than 5 years old = 4 (penguins) + 2 (giraffes) = 6\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe total number of animals more than 5 years old is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
