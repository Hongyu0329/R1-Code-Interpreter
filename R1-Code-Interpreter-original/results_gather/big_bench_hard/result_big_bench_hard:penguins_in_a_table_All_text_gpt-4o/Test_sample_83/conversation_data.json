    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data and apply the conditions specified in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Table Analysis:**\n   - We have a table with the following penguins:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Condition of Deletion:**\n   - The penguin named Bernard is deleted from the table. After deletion, the table consists of:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n3. **Applying the Conditions:**\n   - We need to find penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.\n   - Let's check each remaining penguin:\n     - **Louis:** \n       - Age: 7 (more than 5 years old)\n       - Weight: 11 kg (less than 12 kg)\n       - Louis meets both conditions.\n     - **Vincent:**\n       - Age: 9 (more than 5 years old)\n       - Weight: 11 kg (less than 12 kg)\n       - Vincent meets both conditions.\n     - **Gwen:**\n       - Age: 8 (more than 5 years old)\n       - Weight: 15 kg (not less than 12 kg)\n       - Gwen does not meet the weight condition.\n\n4. **Counting the Penguins:**\n   - Louis and Vincent both meet the conditions of being more than 5 years old and weighing less than 12 kg.\n   - Therefore, there are 2 penguins that meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh less than 12 kg is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B>>>."
