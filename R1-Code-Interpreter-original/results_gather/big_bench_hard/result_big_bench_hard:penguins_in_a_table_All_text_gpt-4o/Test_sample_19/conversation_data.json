    "To determine the youngest penguin, we need to analyze the given data step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - The table consists of four columns: name, age, height (cm), and weight (kg).\n   - Each row after the header represents a penguin with its respective attributes.\n\n2. **Extract the Data:**\n   - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n   - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n3. **Identify the Youngest Penguin:**\n   - Compare the ages of the penguins:\n     - Louis is 7 years old.\n     - Bernard is 5 years old.\n     - Vincent is 9 years old.\n     - Gwen is 8 years old.\n\n4. **Consider the Deletion:**\n   - The problem states that Bernard is deleted from the table.\n   - After deletion, the remaining penguins are Louis, Vincent, and Gwen.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate the Youngest Penguin:**\n   - After Bernard's deletion, compare the ages of the remaining penguins:\n     - Louis is 7 years old.\n     - Vincent is 9 years old.\n     - Gwen is 8 years old.\n   - The youngest among the remaining penguins is Louis, who is 7 years old.\n\n6. **Consider the Options:**\n   - The options provided are:\n     (A) Louis\n     (B) Bernard\n     (C) Vincent\n     (D) Gwen\n     (E) James\n\n7. **Select the Correct Option:**\n   - Since Bernard is deleted and James is not mentioned in the table, the youngest penguin among the options is Louis.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
