    "To determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old, we need to analyze the age of each penguin listed in the table. Let's go through the data step by step:\n\n1. **Louis**: Age is 7.\n   - Since 7 is greater than 5, Louis is more than 5 years old.\n\n2. **Bernard**: Age is 5.\n   - Since 5 is not greater than 5, Bernard is not more than 5 years old.\n\n3. **Vincent**: Age is 9.\n   - Since 9 is greater than 5, Vincent is more than 5 years old.\n\n4. **Gwen**: Age is 8.\n   - Since 8 is greater than 5, Gwen is more than 5 years old.\n\nNow, let's count the number of penguins who are more than 5 years old:\n- Louis is more than 5 years old.\n- Vincent is more than 5 years old.\n- Gwen is more than 5 years old.\n\nIn total, there are 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C) 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
