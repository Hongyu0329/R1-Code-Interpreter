    "To determine the total number of animals listed in the tables, we need to count the number of penguins and giraffes separately and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Count the Penguins:**\n   - Initially, there are four penguins listed: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.\n   - A new penguin, James, is added to the table.\n   - Total number of penguins = 4 (initial) + 1 (new) = 5.\n\n2. **Count the Giraffes:**\n   - The giraffe table lists four giraffes: Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna.\n   - Total number of giraffes = 4.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Animals:**\n   - Total animals = Total penguins + Total giraffes = 5 (penguins) + 4 (giraffes) = 9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals listed in the tables is 9.\n\nThe correct answer is: <<<E>>>."
