    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the cumulated age of all the penguins listed in the table. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the ages of each penguin:**\n   - Louis: 7 years old\n   - Bernard: 5 years old\n   - Vincent: 9 years old\n   - Gwen: 8 years old\n\n2. **Add the ages together:**\n   - Start with Louis: 7\n   - Add Bernard's age: 7 + 5 = 12\n   - Add Vincent's age: 12 + 9 = 21\n   - Add Gwen's age: 21 + 8 = 29\n\n3. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - Double-check each addition step to ensure accuracy:\n     - 7 (Louis) + 5 (Bernard) = 12\n     - 12 + 9 (Vincent) = 21\n     - 21 + 8 (Gwen) = 29\n\n4. **Match the result with the given options:**\n   - The calculated cumulated age is 29.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (B) 29 matches our calculated result.\n\nTherefore, the cumulated age of the penguins is:\n\n<<<29>>>"
