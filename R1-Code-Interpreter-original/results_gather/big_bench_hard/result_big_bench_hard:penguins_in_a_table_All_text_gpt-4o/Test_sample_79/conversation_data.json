    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given data and perform the specified operations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Table Analysis:**\n   - The table initially contains the following penguins:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Adding a New Penguin:**\n   - We add a new penguin named James with the following details:\n     - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n3. **Deleting a Penguin:**\n   - We delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n\n4. **Updated Table:**\n   - After adding James and deleting Bernard, the table now contains:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n     - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n5. **Counting Penguins Older Than 5 Years:**\n   - We need to count the number of penguins whose age is more than 5 years.\n   - Louis is 7 years old, which is more than 5.\n   - Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 5.\n   - Gwen is 8 years old, which is more than 5.\n   - James is 12 years old, which is more than 5.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - All four penguins (Louis, Vincent, Gwen, and James) are older than 5 years.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins more than 5 years old is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<D>>>."
