    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data and apply the conditions specified in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Data:**\n   - We have a table with penguins and their attributes: name, age, height, and weight.\n   - The initial penguins in the table are:\n     - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n     - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n   - A new penguin, James, is added with the following attributes:\n     - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n2. **Identify the Condition:**\n   - We need to find the number of penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Penguin Against the Condition:**\n   - **Louis:** \n     - Age: 7 (more than 5 years old)\n     - Weight: 11 kg (not more than 12 kg)\n     - Does not meet both conditions.\n   - **Bernard:**\n     - Age: 5 (not more than 5 years old)\n     - Weight: 13 kg (more than 12 kg)\n     - Does not meet both conditions.\n   - **Vincent:**\n     - Age: 9 (more than 5 years old)\n     - Weight: 11 kg (not more than 12 kg)\n     - Does not meet both conditions.\n   - **Gwen:**\n     - Age: 8 (more than 5 years old)\n     - Weight: 15 kg (more than 12 kg)\n     - Meets both conditions.\n   - **James:**\n     - Age: 12 (more than 5 years old)\n     - Weight: 12 kg (not more than 12 kg)\n     - Does not meet both conditions.\n\n4. **Count the Penguins Meeting Both Conditions:**\n   - Only Gwen meets both conditions of being more than 5 years old and weighing more than 12 kg.\n\n5. **Determine the Correct Option:**\n   - The number of penguins meeting the conditions is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
