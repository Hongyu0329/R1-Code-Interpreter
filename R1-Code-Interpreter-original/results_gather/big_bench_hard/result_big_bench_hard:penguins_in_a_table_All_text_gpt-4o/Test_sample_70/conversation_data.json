    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the steps and changes made to the table of penguins.\n\n1. **Initial Table Analysis:**\n   - The table initially contains the following penguins:\n     - Louis\n     - Bernard\n     - Vincent\n     - Gwen\n   - This means there are initially 4 penguins in the table.\n\n2. **Adding a Penguin:**\n   - We add a new penguin named James to the table.\n   - After adding James, the table now contains:\n     - Louis\n     - Bernard\n     - Vincent\n     - Gwen\n     - James\n   - This increases the total number of penguins to 5.\n\n3. **Deleting a Penguin:**\n   - We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n   - After deleting Bernard, the table now contains:\n     - Louis\n     - Vincent\n     - Gwen\n     - James\n   - This reduces the total number of penguins to 4.\n\n4. **Final Count:**\n   - After all the additions and deletions, the final number of penguins in the table is 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
