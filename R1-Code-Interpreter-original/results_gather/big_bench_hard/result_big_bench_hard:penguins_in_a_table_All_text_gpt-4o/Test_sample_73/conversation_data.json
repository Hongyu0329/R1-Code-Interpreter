    "To determine which penguin has the shortest name, we need to analyze the names of the penguins provided in the table. The names given are:\n\n1. Louis\n2. Bernard\n3. Vincent\n4. Gwen\n\nWe will count the number of characters in each name:\n\n- Louis: 5 characters\n- Bernard: 7 characters\n- Vincent: 7 characters\n- Gwen: 4 characters\n\nNow, we compare the character counts to find the shortest name:\n\n- Louis has 5 characters.\n- Bernard has 7 characters.\n- Vincent has 7 characters.\n- Gwen has 4 characters.\n\nGwen has the shortest name with 4 characters.\n\nThe options provided are:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\n\nThe correct answer, based on the analysis, is option (D) Gwen.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<D>>>."
