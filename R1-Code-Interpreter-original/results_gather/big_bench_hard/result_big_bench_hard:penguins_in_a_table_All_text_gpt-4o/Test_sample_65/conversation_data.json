    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the average height of the penguins after Bernard is removed from the table. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Remaining Penguins:**\n   - The original list of penguins includes: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.\n   - Bernard is removed from the list.\n   - The remaining penguins are: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen.\n\n2. **Extract the Heights of the Remaining Penguins:**\n   - Louis has a height of 50 cm.\n   - Vincent has a height of 60 cm.\n   - Gwen has a height of 70 cm.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average Height:**\n   - Add the heights of the remaining penguins: 50 + 60 + 70 = 180 cm.\n   - Count the number of remaining penguins: 3.\n   - Calculate the average height: 180 cm / 3 = 60 cm.\n\n4. **Match the Average Height with the Options Provided:**\n   - The calculated average height is 60 cm.\n   - Option (A) corresponds to 60.\n\nTherefore, the average height of the penguins after Bernard is removed is 60 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<A>>>."
