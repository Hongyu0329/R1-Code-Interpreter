    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the error in the translation from German to English. The original German sentence provides information about the family of birds of prey known as \"Habichtartige,\" including the number of genera and species. The English translation contains a discrepancy in the numerical values.\n\nLet's break down the original German sentence:\n- \"Die Habichtartigen sind eine Familie der Greifvögel\" translates to \"The hawk-types are a family of birds of prey.\"\n- \"umfassen die meisten ihrer Vertreter\" translates to \"comprise most of their representatives.\"\n- \"je nach Autor etwa 76–82 Gattungen und 260 lebende Arten\" translates to \"depending on the author about 76-82 genera and 260 living species.\"\n\nNow, let's compare this with the English translation:\n- The translation states \"about 76-82 genera and 360 living species.\"\n\nThe discrepancy lies in the number of living species. The original German text states \"260 lebende Arten\" (260 living species), while the English translation states \"360 living species.\"\n\nThis indicates that the error in the translation pertains to numerical values, as the number of living species has been incorrectly translated.\n\nTherefore, the error type is:\n(B) Numerical Values\n\n<<<Numerical Values>>>"
