    "The task is to identify the type of error in the given translation from German to English. Let's analyze the source and the translation:\n\n- **Source (German):** \"Als Fassadenbrand werden Ereignisse bezeichnet, bei denen Teile der Fassade eines Gebäudes in Brand geraten.\"\n- **Translation (English):** \"A facade fire refers to events in which parts of the facade of a building are set on ice.\"\n\nThe key part of the source sentence is \"in Brand geraten,\" which translates to \"catch fire\" or \"are set on fire\" in English. However, the translation says \"are set on ice,\" which is incorrect. The error here is that the phrase \"in Brand\" (meaning \"on fire\") has been incorrectly translated to \"on ice,\" which is the opposite in terms of meaning.\n\nThis type of error falls under the category of \"Negation or Antonyms\" because the translation uses a term that is the opposite of the intended meaning.\n\nTherefore, the error in the translation pertains to:\n\n<<<C) Negation or Antonyms>>>"
