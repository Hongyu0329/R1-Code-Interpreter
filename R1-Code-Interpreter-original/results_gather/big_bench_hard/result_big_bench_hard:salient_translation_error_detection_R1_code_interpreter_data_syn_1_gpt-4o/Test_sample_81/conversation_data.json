    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the source text in German with its English translation and identify the type of error present in the translation.\n\n1. **Source Text Analysis**:\n   - The source text states that Kathrinhagen is a part of the municipality of Auetal in the district of Schaumburg in Lower Saxony with approximately 870 inhabitants.\n\n2. **Translation Analysis**:\n   - The translation states that Kathrinhagen is a district of the municipality of Auetal in the district of Schaumburg in Lower Saxony with about 70 inhabitants.\n\n3. **Identifying the Error**:\n   - The key difference between the source and the translation is the number of inhabitants. The source mentions \"etwa 870 Einwohnern\" (about 870 inhabitants), while the translation mentions \"about 70 inhabitants.\"\n\n4. **Error Type**:\n   - The error pertains to the numerical value of the inhabitants. The number \"870\" in the source text has been incorrectly translated as \"70\" in the English translation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the error type is related to numerical values.\n\n<<<B>>>"
