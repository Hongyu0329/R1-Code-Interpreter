    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the source sentence in German with its English translation and identify the type of error present in the translation.\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis**:\n   - The German sentence is: \"Deutsche Forschungsschiffe übernehmen vielfältige Forschungsaufgaben auf den Meeren.\"\n   - Breaking it down:\n     - \"Deutsche Forschungsschiffe\" translates to \"German research vessels.\"\n     - \"übernehmen\" translates to \"carry out\" or \"undertake.\"\n     - \"vielfältige Forschungsaufgaben\" translates to \"a wide range of research tasks.\"\n     - \"auf den Meeren\" translates to \"on the seas.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis**:\n   - The English translation provided is: \"German research vessels carry out a wide range of tasks on the seas.\"\n   - Comparing this with the source:\n     - \"German research vessels\" matches \"Deutsche Forschungsschiffe.\"\n     - \"carry out\" matches \"übernehmen.\"\n     - \"a wide range of tasks\" is where the discrepancy lies. The source specifies \"Forschungsaufgaben\" (research tasks), but the translation omits \"research,\" simply stating \"tasks.\"\n     - \"on the seas\" matches \"auf den Meeren.\"\n\n3. **Error Identification**:\n   - The error in the translation is the omission of the word \"research\" in \"a wide range of tasks.\" This changes the meaning from specific \"research tasks\" to the more general \"tasks.\"\n\n4. **Error Type**:\n   - The error type is related to the omission of a significant detail, which is \"research\" in this context. This falls under the category of \"Dropped Content\" because a significant part of the meaning (the specificity of the tasks being research-related) is missing in the translation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the error in the translation pertains to:\n\n<<<E) Dropped Content>>>"
