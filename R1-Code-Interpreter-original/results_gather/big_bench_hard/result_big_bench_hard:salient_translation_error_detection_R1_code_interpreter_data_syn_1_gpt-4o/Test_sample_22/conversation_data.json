    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the error in the translation from German to English. Let's break down the source sentence and the translation:\n\n1. **Source Sentence (German):** \"Kohl bildet eine Gattung der Familie der Kreuzblütler.\"\n   - \"Kohl\" refers to \"cabbage.\"\n   - \"bildet eine Gattung\" translates to \"forms a genus.\"\n   - \"der Familie der Kreuzblütler\" translates to \"of the family of cruciferous plants.\"\n\n2. **Translation (English):** \"Kohl is a genius of the Cruciferous Family.\"\n   - \"Kohl\" is correctly translated as \"Kohl\" (or \"cabbage\").\n   - \"is a genius\" is incorrect. The correct translation should be \"is a genus.\"\n   - \"of the Cruciferous Family\" is a correct translation of \"der Familie der Kreuzblütler.\"\n\nThe error in the translation is in the phrase \"is a genius,\" where \"genius\" is used instead of \"genus.\" This is an error related to the use of a wrong word that sounds similar but has a different meaning.\n\nNow, let's identify the type of error from the given options:\n- (A) Modifiers or Adjectives: This option is not applicable as the error is not about modifiers or adjectives.\n- (B) Numerical Values: This option is not applicable as there are no numerical values involved.\n- (C) Negation or Antonyms: This option is not applicable as there is no negation or antonym involved.\n- (D) Named Entities: This option is not applicable as the error is not about named entities.\n- (E) Dropped Content: This option is not applicable as no content is dropped.\n- (F) Facts: This option is applicable because the error is a factual one, where \"genius\" is incorrectly used instead of \"genus.\"\n\nThe error pertains to a factual mistake in the translation.\n\n<<<F>>>"
