    "The task is to identify the type of error in the given translation from German to English. Let's analyze the source and the translation:\n\n- Source: \"Beth Clare Rodford ist eine ehemalige britische Ruderin.\"\n- Translation: \"Beth Clare Rodford is a British rower.\"\n\nThe German word \"ehemalige\" translates to \"former\" in English. However, in the translation, the word \"former\" is missing, which changes the meaning of the sentence. The translation suggests that Beth Clare Rodford is currently a British rower, whereas the source indicates that she is a former rower.\n\nThe error here is that a modifier or adjective (\"ehemalige\" meaning \"former\") has been omitted in the translation.\n\nTherefore, the error pertains to:\n\n(A) Modifiers or Adjectives\n\n<<<A>>>"
