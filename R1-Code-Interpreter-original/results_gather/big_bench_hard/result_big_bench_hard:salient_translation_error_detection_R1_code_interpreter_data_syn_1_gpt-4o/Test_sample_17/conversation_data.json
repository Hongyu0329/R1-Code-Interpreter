    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the source sentence in German with its English translation and identify the type of error present in the translation.\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis**:\n   - The German sentence is: \"Minnesota Point ist eine Insel und ehemalige Halbinsel an der M端ndung des Saint Louis River in den Oberen See.\"\n   - Breaking it down:\n     - \"Minnesota Point ist eine Insel\" translates to \"Minnesota Point is an island\".\n     - \"und ehemalige Halbinsel\" translates to \"and former peninsula\".\n     - \"an der M端ndung des Saint Louis River\" translates to \"at the mouth of the Saint Louis River\".\n     - \"in den Oberen See\" translates to \"in the Upper Lake\".\n\n2. **Translation Analysis**:\n   - The English translation provided is: \"Minnesota Point is an island and former peninsula at the mouth of the Saint Louis River.\"\n   - Comparing this with the source sentence, we notice that the phrase \"in den Oberen See\" (which means \"in the Upper Lake\") is missing in the translation.\n\n3. **Error Identification**:\n   - The missing part \"in den Oberen See\" indicates that a significant clause has been removed in the translation.\n   - This type of error falls under the category of \"Dropped Content\".\n\nTherefore, the error in the translation is due to dropped content.\n\n<<<E) Dropped Content>>>"
