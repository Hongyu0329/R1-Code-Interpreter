    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the type of error present in the translation from German to English. The source sentence in German is \"ist ein ehemaliger tschechischer Tennisspieler,\" which translates to \"is a former Czech tennis player\" in English. However, the given translation is \"is a former Czech soccer player.\"\n\nLet's analyze the components of the sentence:\n\n1. \"ehemaliger\" translates to \"former\" - this part is correctly translated.\n2. \"tschechischer\" translates to \"Czech\" - this part is also correctly translated.\n3. \"Tennisspieler\" translates to \"tennis player\" - this is where the error occurs. The translation incorrectly uses \"soccer player\" instead of \"tennis player.\"\n\nThe error involves changing the sport from \"tennis\" to \"soccer,\" which is a change in the named entity (the type of player). Therefore, the error pertains to the category of Named Entities.\n\nThus, the correct option is (D) Named Entities.\n\n<<<Named Entities>>>"
