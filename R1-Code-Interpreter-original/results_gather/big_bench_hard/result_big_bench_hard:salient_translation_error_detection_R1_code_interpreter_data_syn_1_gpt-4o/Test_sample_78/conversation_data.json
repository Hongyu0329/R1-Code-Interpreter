    "To identify the error in the translation, let's compare the source text with the translation:\n\n1. **Source**: \"Der Dortmund-Ems-Kanal ist eine Bundeswasserstraße zwischen dem Dortmunder Stadthafen und Papenburg/Ems in den Bundesländern Nordrhein-Westfalen und Niedersachsen.\"\n2. **Translation**: \"The Dortmund-Ems Canal is a federal waterway between Dortmund's city port and Papenburg/Ems in the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the translation:\n\n- **Named Entities**: The names \"Dortmund-Ems Canal,\" \"Dortmund's city port,\" and \"Papenburg/Ems\" are correctly translated. However, the translation omits \"Niedersachsen\" (Lower Saxony), which is a named entity.\n- **Numerical Values**: There are no numerical values in the source text or translation.\n- **Modifiers or Adjectives**: The translation does not change any modifiers or adjectives.\n- **Negation or Antonyms**: There is no introduction or removal of negation or change to antonyms.\n- **Facts**: The translation does not introduce any trivial factual errors.\n- **Dropped Content**: The translation omits \"Niedersachsen\" (Lower Saxony), which is a significant part of the original sentence.\n\nThe error in the translation is the omission of \"Niedersachsen\" (Lower Saxony), which is a significant clause in the original sentence.
