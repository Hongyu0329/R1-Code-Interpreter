    "To identify the error in the translation, let's analyze the source and the translation:\n\n1. **Source**: \"Die FZ90 ist eine ungelenkte 70-mm-Luft-Boden-Rakete zum Einsatz an Flugzeugen und Hubschraubern.\"\n   - \"ungelenkte\" translates to \"unguided\"\n   - \"70-mm\" translates to \"70-mm\"\n   - \"Luft-Boden-Rakete\" translates to \"air-to-surface missile\"\n   - \"zum Einsatz an Flugzeugen und Hubschraubern\" translates to \"used on aircraft and helicopters\"\n\n2. **Translation**: \"The FZ90 is an unguided 70 nm air-to-surface missile used on aircraft and helicopters.\"\n   - \"unguided\" is correct\n   - \"70 nm\" is incorrect; it should be \"70 mm\"\n   - \"air-to-surface missile\" is correct\n   - \"used on aircraft and helicopters\" is correct\n\nThe error in the translation is with the numerical value \"70 nm\" instead of \"70 mm\". The unit of measurement has been changed from millimeters (mm) to nanometers (nm), which is a numerical value error.\n\nTherefore, the error pertains to:\n\n(B) Numerical Values\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following translations from German to English contain a particular error.
