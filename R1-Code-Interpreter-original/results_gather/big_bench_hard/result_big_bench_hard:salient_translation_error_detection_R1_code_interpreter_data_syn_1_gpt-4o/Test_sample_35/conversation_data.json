    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the source sentence in German with its English translation and identify the type of error present in the translation.\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis:**\n   - The German sentence is: \"Holsterhausen ist ein Stadtteil der kreisfreien Stadt Essen, nach Einwohnern der viertgrößte.\"\n   - Translation: \"Holsterhausen is a district of the county-free city of Essen, the fourth largest by population.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis:**\n   - The English translation provided is: \"Holsterhausen is a district of the county-free city of Essen, the fifth largest after inhabitants.\"\n\n3. **Identifying the Error:**\n   - The key part of the sentence to focus on is \"nach Einwohnern der viertgrößte\" which translates to \"the fourth largest by population.\"\n   - The translation says \"the fifth largest after inhabitants,\" which is incorrect.\n\n4. **Error Type:**\n   - The error is in the numerical value. The German sentence states \"viertgrößte\" (fourth largest), but the translation states \"fifth largest.\"\n\nTherefore, the error in the translation pertains to numerical values.\n\n<<<B>>>"
