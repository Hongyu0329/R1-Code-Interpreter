    "The task is to identify the type of error in the given translation from German to English. Let's analyze the source and the translation:\n\n- **Source (German):** \"Artemisia ist eine Pflanzengattung in der Familie der Korbblütler.\"\n- **Translation (English):** \"Artemisia is a genus of plants in the family Artemisia.\"\n\nNow, let's break down the source sentence:\n\n- \"Artemisia\" is the subject, which is a genus of plants.\n- \"Pflanzengattung\" translates to \"genus of plants.\"\n- \"in der Familie der Korbblütler\" translates to \"in the family of Asteraceae\" (Korbblütler is the German term for the Asteraceae family, also known as the daisy family).\n\nIn the translation, the phrase \"in the family Artemisia\" is incorrect. The correct translation should be \"in the family Asteraceae\" or \"in the family of daisies.\" The error here is that the family name \"Korbblütler\" (Asteraceae) has been incorrectly translated as \"Artemisia,\" which is a named entity error.\n\nTherefore, the error in the translation pertains to:\n\n(D) Named Entities\n\nThe family name has been incorrectly translated, which is a named entity error.\n\n<<<D>>>"
