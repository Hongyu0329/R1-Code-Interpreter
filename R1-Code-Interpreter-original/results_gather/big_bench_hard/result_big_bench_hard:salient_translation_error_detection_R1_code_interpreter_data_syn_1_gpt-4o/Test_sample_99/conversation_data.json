    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the type of error present in the translation of the given German sentence to English. The original German sentence is:\n\n\"Fabian Baumgärtel ist ein deutscher Fußballspieler.\"\n\nThe English translation provided is:\n\n\"Fabian Baumgärtel is a German footballer who plays as a goalkeeper.\"\n\nLet's break down the translation:\n\n1. **Named Entities**: The name \"Fabian Baumgärtel\" and the term \"German footballer\" are correctly translated, so there is no error in named entities.\n\n2. **Numerical Values**: There are no numerical values in the sentence, so this option is not applicable.\n\n3. **Modifiers or Adjectives**: The adjective \"German\" is correctly translated from \"deutscher,\" so there is no error here.\n\n4. **Negation or Antonyms**: There is no negation or antonym introduced in the translation.\n\n5. **Facts**: The translation introduces a factual error by specifying that Fabian Baumgärtel \"plays as a goalkeeper,\" which is not mentioned in the original sentence. The original sentence only states that he is a football player, without specifying his position.\n\n6. **Dropped Content**: There is no significant clause dropped in the translation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the error in the translation pertains to the introduction of a factual error regarding the position played by Fabian Baumgärtel, which is not mentioned in the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (F) Facts.\n\n<<<F>>>"
