    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the source sentence in German with its English translation and identify the type of error present in the translation.\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis**:\n   - The source sentence in German is: \"Phil Morris ist ein US-amerikanischer Schauspieler.\"\n   - Translating this directly to English, it means: \"Phil Morris is a US-American actor.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis**:\n   - The given translation is: \"Phil Morris is an American director.\"\n\n3. **Identifying the Error**:\n   - The key difference between the source and the translation is the word \"Schauspieler\" (actor) being translated as \"director.\"\n   - This is a change in the profession or role of the person, which is a factual error.\n\n4. **Error Classification**:\n   - The error pertains to the category of \"Facts\" because the translation introduces a factual inaccuracy by changing the profession of Phil Morris from \"actor\" to \"director.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the error in the translation is a factual error.\n\n<<<F>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following translations from German to English contain a particular error.
