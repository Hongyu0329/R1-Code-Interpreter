    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the type of error present in the translation from German to English. Let's analyze the given source and translation:\n\n- Source: \"Ferenc Farkas war ein ungarischer Komponist.\"\n- Translation: \"Ferenc Puskas was a Hungarian composer.\"\n\nThe source sentence states that \"Ferenc Farkas was a Hungarian composer.\" However, the translation changes \"Ferenc Farkas\" to \"Ferenc Puskas.\" \n\nFerenc Farkas and Ferenc Puskas are two different individuals. Ferenc Farkas was indeed a Hungarian composer, while Ferenc Puskas was a famous Hungarian footballer. This change in the name is a clear example of an error involving named entities, where one entity (Ferenc Farkas) is incorrectly translated as another entity (Ferenc Puskas).\n\nTherefore, the error in the translation pertains to named entities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
