    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the error in the translation from German to English. The source text is \"Viele deutsche Nationaldenkmäler des 19.\" and the translation is \"Many German national monuments of the 190th century.\"\n\nLet's break down the source and translation:\n\n1. **Source**: \"Viele deutsche Nationaldenkmäler des 19.\"\n   - \"Viele\" means \"many.\"\n   - \"deutsche\" means \"German.\"\n   - \"Nationaldenkmäler\" means \"national monuments.\"\n   - \"des 19.\" refers to the 19th century.\n\n2. **Translation**: \"Many German national monuments of the 190th century.\"\n   - The translation correctly translates \"Viele deutsche Nationaldenkmäler\" to \"Many German national monuments.\"\n   - However, \"des 19.\" should be translated as \"of the 19th century,\" not \"of the 190th century.\"\n\nThe error in the translation is related to the numerical value of the century. The source text refers to the 19th century, but the translation incorrectly refers to the 190th century.\n\nTherefore, the error pertains to:\n\n(B) Numerical Values\n\nThe translation error involves the incorrect translation of the numerical value of the century.\n\n<<<Numerical Values>>>"
