    "To identify the error in the translation, let's analyze the source and the translated text:\n\n1. **Source Text**: \"Die Liste der Registered Historic Places im Comal County führt alle Bauwerke und historischen Stätten im texanischen Comal County auf, die in das National Register of Historic Places aufgenommen wurden.\"\n\n2. **Translation**: \"The Register ed. Historic Places in Comal County lists all buildings and historical sites in Texas, that have been added to the National Register of Historic Places.\"\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The source text specifies \"im texanischen Comal County,\" which translates to \"in the Texan Comal County.\" This indicates that the list is specific to Comal County in Texas.\n- The translation, however, states \"in Texas,\" which generalizes the location to the entire state of Texas rather than specifying Comal County.\n\n**Error Identification**:\n- The error here is that the translation changes the specific location \"Comal County\" to a broader location \"Texas,\" which is a factual error regarding the specific location mentioned in the source text.\n\nBased on the options provided, the error pertains to:\n- (F) Facts: Trivial factual errors not pertaining to the above classes are introduced in the translations.\n\nTherefore, the error in the translation is a factual error regarding the specific location mentioned.\n\n<<<F>>>"
