    "To identify the error in the translation, let's analyze the source and translated sentences:\n\n1. **Source Sentence**: \"Der Nischni Nowgoroder Kreml ist eine ehemalige Zitadelle in der Großstadt Nischni Nowgorod in Russland an der Mündung des Flusses Oka in die Wolga.\"\n   - Translation: \"Nizhny Novgooder Kremlin is a former citadel in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, at the mouth of the Okja River in the Volga River.\"\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - **Named Entities**: The name \"Nischni Nowgoroder\" is translated as \"Nizhny Novgooder,\" which is incorrect. The correct translation should be \"Nizhny Novgorod.\"\n   - **Numerical Values**: There are no numerical values in the sentence.\n   - **Modifiers or Adjectives**: The adjectives and modifiers seem to be correctly translated.\n   - **Negation or Antonyms**: There is no negation or antonym error.\n   - **Facts**: The factual information about the location and description of the Kremlin is correct.\n   - **Dropped Content**: No significant content is dropped in the translation.\n\nThe error in the translation pertains to the incorrect translation of the named entity \"Nischni Nowgoroder\" to \"Nizhny Novgooder.\"\n\nTherefore, the error type is related to named entities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
