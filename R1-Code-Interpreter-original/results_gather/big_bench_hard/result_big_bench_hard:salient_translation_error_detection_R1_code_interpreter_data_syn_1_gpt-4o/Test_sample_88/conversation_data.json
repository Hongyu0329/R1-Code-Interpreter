    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the source sentence in German with its English translation and identify the type of error present.\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis**:\n   - The German sentence describes the \"evangelische St.-Ulrichs-Kirche\" in Rastede, Ammerland, near Oldenburg.\n   - It is described as a \"mittelalterlicher Bau\" (medieval building) with \"überwiegend barocker Ausstattung\" (predominantly baroque furnishings).\n\n2. **Translation Analysis**:\n   - The English translation describes the same church as a \"modern building\" with \"predominantly baroque furnishings.\"\n\n3. **Error Identification**:\n   - The key difference between the source and the translation is the description of the building's age or style.\n   - The German sentence describes the building as \"mittelalterlich\" (medieval), while the English translation describes it as \"modern.\"\n   - This is a change in the adjective or modifier describing the building.\n\n4. **Error Type**:\n   - The error pertains to the change in the adjective describing the building's style or age from \"medieval\" to \"modern.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the error type is related to \"Modifiers or Adjectives.\"\n\n<<<A>>>"
