    "The source sentence in German states that the 1952 Summer Olympics took place from July 19 to August 3. However, the translation provided is \"The 1952 Summer Olympics were held at the 1952 Summer Olympics,\" which is incorrect. The translation error here is that the date range \"vom 19. Juli bis 3.\" is completely omitted, and instead, the phrase \"at the 1952 Summer Olympics\" is repeated, which does not convey the original meaning.\n\nThe error type that best fits this situation is \"Dropped Content,\" as a significant clause (the date range) in the translation is removed.\n\n<<<E) Dropped Content>>>"
