    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the source sentence in German with its English translation and identify the type of error present in the translation.\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis**:\n   - The source sentence in German is: \"Eleonore Lingnau-Kluge war eine deutsche Malerin.\"\n   - Translation to English (without errors): \"Eleonore Lingnau-Kluge was a German painter.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis**:\n   - The given translation is: \"Eleonore Lingnau-Kluge was a German dancer.\"\n\n3. **Identifying the Error**:\n   - The key difference between the correct translation and the given translation is the word \"Malerin\" (painter) being translated as \"dancer.\"\n   - This is a change in the profession or occupation of the person, which is a factual detail about Eleonore Lingnau-Kluge.\n\n4. **Error Type**:\n   - The error involves changing a factual detail about the subject, specifically the profession from \"painter\" to \"dancer.\"\n   - This type of error falls under the category of \"Facts\" as it introduces a trivial factual error.\n\nTherefore, the translation error pertains to the category of \"Facts.\"\n\n<<<F>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following translations from German to English contain a particular error.
