At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Karl, Bob is dancing with Melissa, Claire is dancing with Lola, Dave is dancing with Sam, and Eve is dancing with Izzi.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Claire and Dave switch partners. Then, Eve and Bob switch partners. Then, Claire and Alice switch partners. Then, Eve and Alice switch partners. Finally, Claire and Dave switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Karl\n(B) Melissa\n(C) Lola\n(D) Sam\n(E) Izzi\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's start by listing the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice is with Karl\n- Bob is with Melissa\n- Claire is with Lola\n- Dave is with Sam\n- Eve is with Izzi\n\nNow, let's apply the partner switches:\n\n1. Claire and Dave switch partners:\n   - Claire is now with Sam\n   - Dave is now with Lola\n\n2. Eve and Bob switch partners:\n   - Eve is now with Melissa\n   - Bob is now with Izzi\n\n3. Claire and Alice switch partners:\n   - Claire is now with Karl\n   - Alice is now with Sam\n\n4. Eve and Alice switch partners:\n   - Eve is now with Sam\n   - Alice is now with Melissa\n\n5. Claire and Dave switch partners:\n   - Claire is now with Lola\n   - Dave is now with Karl\n\nAfter all the switches, we need to determine who Alice is dancing with. Let's write a Python script to track these changes and find the final partner of Alice.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    \"Alice\": \"Karl\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Melissa\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Lola\",\n    \"Dave\": \"Sam\",\n    \"Eve\": \"Izzi\"\n}\n\n# Apply the partner switches\n# 1. Claire and Dave switch partners\npartners[\"Claire\"], partners[\"Dave\"] = partners[\"Dave\"], partners[\"Claire\"]\n\n# 2. Eve and Bob switch partners\npartners[\"Eve\"], partners[\"Bob\"] = partners[\"Bob\"], partners[\"Eve\"]\n\n# 3. Claire and Alice switch partners\npartners[\"Claire\"], partners[\"Alice\"] = partners[\"Alice\"], partners[\"Claire\"]\n\n# 4. Eve and Alice switch partners\npartners[\"Eve\"], partners[\"Alice\"] = partners[\"Alice\"], partners[\"Eve\"]\n\n# 5. Claire and Dave switch partners\npartners[\"Claire\"], partners[\"Dave\"] = partners[\"Dave\"], partners[\"Claire\"]\n\n# Find out who Alice is dancing with\nprint(partners[\"Alice\"])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out the final partner of Alice.",
    "The code execution shows that after all the partner switches, Alice is dancing with Melissa. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B) Melissa>>>"
