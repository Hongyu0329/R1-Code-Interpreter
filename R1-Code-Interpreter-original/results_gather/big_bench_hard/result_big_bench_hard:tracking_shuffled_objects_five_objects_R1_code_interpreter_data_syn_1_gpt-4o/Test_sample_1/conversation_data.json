    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's start by listing the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence.\n\n1. Initial pairings:\n   - Alice with Ophelia\n   - Bob with Jamie\n   - Claire with Melissa\n   - Dave with Rodrigo\n   - Eve with Patrick\n\n2. First switch: Claire and Bob switch partners.\n   - Bob with Melissa\n   - Claire with Jamie\n\n3. Second switch: Claire and Eve switch partners.\n   - Claire with Patrick\n   - Eve with Jamie\n\n4. Third switch: Claire and Bob switch partners.\n   - Claire with Melissa\n   - Bob with Patrick\n\n5. Fourth switch: Eve and Dave switch partners.\n   - Eve with Rodrigo\n   - Dave with Jamie\n\n6. Fifth switch: Claire and Alice switch partners.\n   - Claire with Ophelia\n   - Alice with Melissa\n\nNow, let's determine who Alice is dancing with at the end of the dance. According to the final switch, Alice is dancing with Melissa.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option (C) Melissa.\n\n<<<C) Melissa>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are dancers at a square dance.
