  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Rodrigo, Bob is dancing with Sam, Claire is dancing with Karl, Dave is dancing with Izzi, and Eve is dancing with Jamie.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Eve and Bob switch partners. Then, Dave and Alice switch partners. Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. Then, Eve and Claire switch partners. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Rodrigo\n(B) Sam\n(C) Karl\n(D) Izzi\n(E) Jamie\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's start by listing the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Rodrigo\n- Bob with Sam\n- Claire with Karl\n- Dave with Izzi\n- Eve with Jamie\n\nNow, let's apply the partner switches:\n\n1. Eve and Bob switch partners:\n   - Eve with Sam\n   - Bob with Jamie\n\n2. Dave and Alice switch partners:\n   - Dave with Rodrigo\n   - Alice with Izzi\n\n3. Alice and Claire switch partners:\n   - Alice with Karl\n   - Claire with Izzi\n\n4. Eve and Claire switch partners:\n   - Eve with Izzi\n   - Claire with Sam\n\n5. Alice and Bob switch partners:\n   - Alice with Jamie\n   - Bob with Karl\n\nAt the end of these switches, we need to determine who Eve is dancing with. Let's write a Python script to track these changes and find the final partner for Eve.\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Rodrigo',\n    'Bob': 'Sam',\n    'Claire': 'Karl',\n    'Dave': 'Izzi',\n    'Eve': 'Jamie'\n}\n\n# Switches\nswitches = [\n    ('Eve', 'Bob'),\n    ('Dave', 'Alice'),\n    ('Alice', 'Claire'),\n    ('Eve', 'Claire'),\n    ('Alice', 'Bob')\n]\n\n# Apply switches\nfor dancer1, dancer2 in switches:\n    partners[dancer1], partners[dancer2] = partners[dancer2], partners[dancer1]\n\n# Find Eve's final partner\nfinal_partner_eve = partners['Eve']\nprint(final_partner_eve)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out who Eve is dancing with at the end.",
    "The code execution shows that Eve is dancing with Izzi at the end of the dance. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
