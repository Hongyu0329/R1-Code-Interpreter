  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Ophelia, Bob is dancing with Lola, Claire is dancing with Izzi, Dave is dancing with Karl, and Eve is dancing with Jamie.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Bob and Claire switch partners. Then, Eve and Dave switch partners. Then, Eve and Claire switch partners. Then, Alice and Eve switch partners. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Ophelia\n(B) Lola\n(C) Izzi\n(D) Karl\n(E) Jamie\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's break down the sequence of partner switches:\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice - Ophelia\n   - Bob - Lola\n   - Claire - Izzi\n   - Dave - Karl\n   - Eve - Jamie\n\n2. **First Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Alice - Ophelia\n   - Bob - Izzi\n   - Claire - Lola\n   - Dave - Karl\n   - Eve - Jamie\n\n3. **Second Switch (Eve and Dave switch partners):**\n   - Alice - Ophelia\n   - Bob - Izzi\n   - Claire - Lola\n   - Dave - Jamie\n   - Eve - Karl\n\n4. **Third Switch (Eve and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Alice - Ophelia\n   - Bob - Izzi\n   - Claire - Karl\n   - Dave - Jamie\n   - Eve - Lola\n\n5. **Fourth Switch (Alice and Eve switch partners):**\n   - Alice - Lola\n   - Bob - Izzi\n   - Claire - Karl\n   - Dave - Jamie\n   - Eve - Ophelia\n\n6. **Fifth Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice - Izzi\n   - Bob - Lola\n   - Claire - Karl\n   - Dave - Jamie\n   - Eve - Ophelia\n\nAfter all the switches, Alice is dancing with Izzi. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) Izzi>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are dancers at a square dance.
