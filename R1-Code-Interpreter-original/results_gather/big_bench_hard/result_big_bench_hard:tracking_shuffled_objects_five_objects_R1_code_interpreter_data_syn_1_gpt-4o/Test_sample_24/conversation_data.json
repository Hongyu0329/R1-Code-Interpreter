At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Karl, Bob is dancing with Lola, Claire is dancing with Ophelia, Dave is dancing with Melissa, and Eve is dancing with Sam.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Alice and Dave switch partners. Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. Then, Alice and Eve switch partners. Then, Bob and Dave switch partners. Finally, Dave and Claire switch partners.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's start by listing the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Karl\n- Bob with Lola\n- Claire with Ophelia\n- Dave with Melissa\n- Eve with Sam\n\nNow, let's apply the partner switches:\n\n1. **Alice and Dave switch partners:**\n   - Alice is now with Melissa\n   - Dave is now with Karl\n\n2. **Alice and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Alice is now with Ophelia\n   - Claire is now with Melissa\n\n3. **Alice and Eve switch partners:**\n   - Alice is now with Sam\n   - Eve is now with Ophelia\n\n4. **Bob and Dave switch partners:**\n   - Bob is now with Karl\n   - Dave is now with Lola\n\n5. **Dave and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Dave is now with Melissa\n   - Claire is now with Lola\n\nAt the end of these switches, we need to determine who Eve is dancing with. Let's summarize the final pairings:\n\n- Alice with Sam\n- Bob with Karl\n- Claire with Lola\n- Dave with Melissa\n- Eve with Ophelia\n\nEve is dancing with Ophelia. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<Ophelia>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are dancers at a square dance.
