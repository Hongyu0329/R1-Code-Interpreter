    "To solve this problem, we need to track the position changes of each player as they swap positions according to the given sequence. We start with the initial positions and apply each swap in order to determine the final position of Eve.\n\nInitial positions:\n- Alice: Goalkeeper\n- Bob: Left Midfielder\n- Claire: Right Winger\n- Dave: Striker\n- Eve: Center Midfielder\n\nLet's apply the swaps step by step:\n\n1. Alice and Claire trade positions:\n   - Alice: Right Winger\n   - Claire: Goalkeeper\n   - Bob: Left Midfielder\n   - Dave: Striker\n   - Eve: Center Midfielder\n\n2. Alice and Bob trade positions:\n   - Alice: Left Midfielder\n   - Claire: Goalkeeper\n   - Bob: Right Winger\n   - Dave: Striker\n   - Eve: Center Midfielder\n\n3. Dave and Bob trade positions:\n   - Alice: Left Midfielder\n   - Claire: Goalkeeper\n   - Bob: Striker\n   - Dave: Right Winger\n   - Eve: Center Midfielder\n\n4. Bob and Eve trade positions:\n   - Alice: Left Midfielder\n   - Claire: Goalkeeper\n   - Bob: Center Midfielder\n   - Dave: Right Winger\n   - Eve: Striker\n\n5. Dave and Eve trade positions:\n   - Alice: Left Midfielder\n   - Claire: Goalkeeper\n   - Bob: Center Midfielder\n   - Dave: Striker\n   - Eve: Right Winger\n\nAfter applying all the swaps, Eve ends up playing as the Right Winger.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) right winger>>>"
