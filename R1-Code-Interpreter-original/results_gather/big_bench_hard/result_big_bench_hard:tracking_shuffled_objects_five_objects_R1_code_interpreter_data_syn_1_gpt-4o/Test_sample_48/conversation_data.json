  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Jamie, Bob is dancing with Rodrigo, Claire is dancing with Patrick, Dave is dancing with Izzi, and Eve is dancing with Melissa.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Dave and Eve switch partners. Then, Bob and Claire switch partners. Then, Bob and Eve switch partners. Then, Claire and Alice switch partners. Finally, Claire and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Jamie\n(B) Rodrigo\n(C) Patrick\n(D) Izzi\n(E) Melissa\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's start by listing the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Jamie\n- Bob with Rodrigo\n- Claire with Patrick\n- Dave with Izzi\n- Eve with Melissa\n\nNow, let's apply the partner switches:\n\n1. **Dave and Eve switch partners:**\n   - Dave is now with Melissa\n   - Eve is now with Izzi\n\n2. **Bob and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Bob is now with Patrick\n   - Claire is now with Rodrigo\n\n3. **Bob and Eve switch partners:**\n   - Bob is now with Izzi\n   - Eve is now with Patrick\n\n4. **Claire and Alice switch partners:**\n   - Claire is now with Jamie\n   - Alice is now with Rodrigo\n\n5. **Claire and Bob switch partners:**\n   - Claire is now with Izzi\n   - Bob is now with Jamie\n\nNow, let's determine who Dave is dancing with at the end of the dance. We know from step 1 that Dave switched to Melissa, and there were no further switches involving Dave. Therefore, Dave is still dancing with Melissa.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to track the changes:\n\n```python\n# Initial pairings\npartners = {\n    \"Alice\": \"Jamie\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Rodrigo\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Patrick\",\n    \"Dave\": \"Izzi\",\n    \"Eve\": \"Melissa\"\n}\n\n# Function to switch partners\ndef switch(partners, person1, person2):\n    partners[person1], partners[person2] = partners[person2], partners[person1]\n\n# Apply the partner switches\nswitch(partners, \"Dave\", \"Eve\")\nswitch(partners, \"Bob\", \"Claire\")\nswitch(partners, \"Bob\", \"Eve\")\nswitch(partners, \"Claire\", \"Alice\")\nswitch(partners, \"Claire\", \"Bob\")\n\n# Output Dave's partner at the end\nprint(partners[\"Dave\"])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final partner of Dave.",
    "The code execution confirms that Dave is dancing with Melissa at the end of the dance. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E) Melissa>>>"
