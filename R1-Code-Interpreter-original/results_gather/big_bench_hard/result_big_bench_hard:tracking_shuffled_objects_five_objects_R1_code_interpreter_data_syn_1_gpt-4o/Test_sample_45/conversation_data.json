At the start of the game, they are each holding a ball: Alice has a blue ball, Bob has a purple ball, Claire has a green ball, Dave has a brown ball, and Eve has a orange ball.\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players trade balls. First, Bob and Claire swap balls. Then, Dave and Bob swap balls. Then, Claire and Bob swap balls. Then, Bob and Alice swap balls. Finally, Eve and Bob swap balls.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of ball swaps and determine which ball Bob ends up with at the end of the game. Let's go through the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Blue\n   - Bob: Purple\n   - Claire: Green\n   - Dave: Brown\n   - Eve: Orange\n\n2. **First Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gets Green, Claire gets Purple\n   - Alice: Blue\n   - Bob: Green\n   - Claire: Purple\n   - Dave: Brown\n   - Eve: Orange\n\n3. **Second Swap (Dave and Bob):**\n   - Bob gets Brown, Dave gets Green\n   - Alice: Blue\n   - Bob: Brown\n   - Claire: Purple\n   - Dave: Green\n   - Eve: Orange\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Bob gets Purple, Claire gets Brown\n   - Alice: Blue\n   - Bob: Purple\n   - Claire: Brown\n   - Dave: Green\n   - Eve: Orange\n\n5. **Fourth Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Bob gets Blue, Alice gets Purple\n   - Alice: Purple\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Brown\n   - Dave: Green\n   - Eve: Orange\n\n6. **Fifth Swap (Eve and Bob):**\n   - Bob gets Orange, Eve gets Blue\n   - Alice: Purple\n   - Bob: Orange\n   - Claire: Brown\n   - Dave: Green\n   - Eve: Blue\n\nAfter all the swaps, Bob ends up with the orange ball. Therefore, the correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
