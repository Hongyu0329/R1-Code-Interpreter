  "question": "Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are holding a white elephant gift exchange. At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a green present, Bob has a brown present, Claire has a purple present, Dave has a white present, and Eve has a blue present.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Alice and Bob swap their gifts. Then, Bob and Eve swap their gifts. Then, Dave and Eve swap their gifts. Then, Alice and Claire swap their gifts. Finally, Bob and Eve swap their gifts. At the end of the event, Dave has the\nOptions:\n(A) green present\n(B) brown present\n(C) purple present\n(D) white present\n(E) blue present\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the presents as they are swapped among the participants. We will simulate each swap step-by-step to determine which present Dave ends up with.\n\nInitially, the distribution of presents is as follows:\n- Alice: Green\n- Bob: Brown\n- Claire: Purple\n- Dave: White\n- Eve: Blue\n\nLet's go through each swap:\n\n1. **Alice and Bob swap their gifts:**\n   - Alice: Brown\n   - Bob: Green\n   - Claire: Purple\n   - Dave: White\n   - Eve: Blue\n\n2. **Bob and Eve swap their gifts:**\n   - Alice: Brown\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Purple\n   - Dave: White\n   - Eve: Green\n\n3. **Dave and Eve swap their gifts:**\n   - Alice: Brown\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Purple\n   - Dave: Green\n   - Eve: White\n\n4. **Alice and Claire swap their gifts:**\n   - Alice: Purple\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Brown\n   - Dave: Green\n   - Eve: White\n\n5. **Bob and Eve swap their gifts:**\n   - Alice: Purple\n   - Bob: White\n   - Claire: Brown\n   - Dave: Green\n   - Eve: Blue\n\nAfter all the swaps, Dave has the green present. Let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial distribution of presents\npresents = {\n    'Alice': 'Green',\n    'Bob': 'Brown',\n    'Claire': 'Purple',\n    'Dave': 'White',\n    'Eve': 'Blue'\n}\n\n# Swap operations\nswaps = [\n    ('Alice', 'Bob'),\n    ('Bob', 'Eve'),\n    ('Dave', 'Eve'),\n    ('Alice', 'Claire'),\n    ('Bob', 'Eve')\n]\n\n# Perform the swaps\nfor person1, person2 in swaps:\n    presents[person1], presents[person2] = presents[person2], presents[person1]\n\n# Output the present Dave has at the end\nprint(presents['Dave'])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final present Dave has.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the swaps, Dave ends up with the green present. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A) green present>>>"
