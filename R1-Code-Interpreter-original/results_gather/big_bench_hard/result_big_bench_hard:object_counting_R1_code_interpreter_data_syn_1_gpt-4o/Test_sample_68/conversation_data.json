    "To determine the number of musical instruments you have, we need to count the distinct instruments mentioned. You have listed a clarinet and a trombone. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Identify the instruments: \n   - Clarinet\n   - Trombone\n\n2. Count the instruments:\n   - There are two distinct instruments mentioned.\n\nSince this is a straightforward counting problem, we don't need to write any code for this. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    I have a clarinet, and a trombone.
