    "To determine the total number of fruits, we need to count each type of fruit and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Nectarines: 3\n- Peach: 1\n- Apple: 1\n- Strawberry: 1\n- Raspberries: 3\n- Banana: 1\n- Plum: 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of fruits by summing these quantities.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of each type of fruit\nnectarines = 3\npeach = 1\napple = 1\nstrawberry = 1\nraspberries = 3\nbanana = 1\nplum = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of fruits\ntotal_fruits = nectarines + peach + apple + strawberry + raspberries + banana + plum\n\n# Print the total number of fruits\nprint(total_fruits)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of fruits.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the total number of fruits as 11. Therefore, the total number of fruits you have is:\n\n<<<11>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    I have three nectarines, a peach, an apple, a strawberry, three raspberries, a banana, and a plum.
