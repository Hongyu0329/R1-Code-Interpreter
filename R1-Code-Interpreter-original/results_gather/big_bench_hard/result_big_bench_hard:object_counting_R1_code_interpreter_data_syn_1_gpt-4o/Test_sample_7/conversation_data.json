    "To solve this problem, we need to count the total number of fruits listed. The list of fruits includes:\n\n- 1 blackberry\n- 1 peach\n- 1 nectarine\n- 1 plum\n- 1 raspberry\n- 1 orange\n- 1 strawberry\n- 1 banana\n- 2 apples\n- 4 grapes\n\nWe can sum these quantities to find the total number of fruits. Let's write a Python script to calculate this.\n\n```python\n# List of quantities of each type of fruit\nfruits = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4]\n\n# Calculate the total number of fruits\ntotal_fruits = sum(fruits)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_fruits)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of fruits.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the total number of fruits as 14. Therefore, the total number of fruits you have is:\n\n<<<14>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    I have a blackberry, a peach, a nectarine, a plum, a raspberry, an orange, a strawberry, a banana, two apples, and four grapes.
