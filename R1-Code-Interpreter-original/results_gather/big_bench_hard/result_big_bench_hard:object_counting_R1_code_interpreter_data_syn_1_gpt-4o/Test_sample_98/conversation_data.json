    "To solve this problem, we need to identify which items in the list are fruits. The items mentioned are:\n\n1. A peach\n2. Three cats\n3. A raspberry\n\nFrom this list, we know that:\n\n- A peach is a fruit.\n- Cats are animals, not fruits.\n- A raspberry is a fruit.\n\nTherefore, we have two fruits: a peach and a raspberry.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    I have a peach, three cats, and a raspberry.
