    "To solve this problem, we need to count the total number of animals listed. The user has mentioned the following animals:\n\n1. A mouse\n2. A rabbit\n3. A dog\n4. A duck\n5. Two goats\n\nWe can calculate the total number of animals by adding each of these together. Let's write a simple Python script to compute this.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nmouse = 1\nrabbit = 1\ndog = 1\nduck = 1\ngoats = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of animals\ntotal_animals = mouse + rabbit + dog + duck + goats\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_animals)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of animals.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the correct output. The total number of animals is the sum of all the individual animals mentioned:\n\n- 1 mouse\n- 1 rabbit\n- 1 dog\n- 1 duck\n- 2 goats\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 6 animals.\n\n<<<6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    I have a mouse, a rabbit, a dog, a duck, and two goats.
