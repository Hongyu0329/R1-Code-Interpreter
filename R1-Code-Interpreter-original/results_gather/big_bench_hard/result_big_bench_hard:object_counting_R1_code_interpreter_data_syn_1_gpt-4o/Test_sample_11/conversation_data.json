    "To solve this problem, we need to count the total number of vegetables listed. The list includes:\n\n- Three yams\n- One lettuce head\n- One onion\n- One potato\n- One cabbage\n- One carrot\n- Two heads of broccoli\n- Two stalks of celery\n\nLet's calculate the total number of vegetables by adding up the quantities of each type.\n\n```python\n# Define the quantities of each vegetable\nyams = 3\nlettuce_head = 1\nonion = 1\npotato = 1\ncabbage = 1\ncarrot = 1\nbroccoli_heads = 2\ncelery_stalks = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of vegetables\ntotal_vegetables = yams + lettuce_head + onion + potato + cabbage + carrot + broccoli_heads + celery_stalks\n\n# Output the total number of vegetables\nprint(total_vegetables)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of vegetables.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the total number of vegetables as 12. This means that when we add up all the quantities of the different vegetables you have, the total comes to 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    I have three yams, a lettuce head, an onion, a potato, a cabbage, a carrot, two heads of broccoli, and two stalks of celery.
