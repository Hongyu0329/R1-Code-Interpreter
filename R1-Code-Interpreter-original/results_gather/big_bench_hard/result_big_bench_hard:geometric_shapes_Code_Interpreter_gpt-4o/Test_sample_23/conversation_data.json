    "\nassistant > To determine the shape drawn by the given SVG path, we need to analyze the sequence of line commands in the path data. The path consists of a series of \"move to\" (M) and \"line to\" (L) commands, which define the vertices and edges of the shape.\n\nThe path data is as follows:\n- M 59.64,77.72 L 75.18,56.50\n- M 75.18,56.50 L 6.90,59.13\n- M 6.90,59.13 L 22.09,77.44\n- M 22.09,77.44 L 2.73,94.57\n- M 2.73,94.57 L 91.78,91.66\n- M 91.78,91.66 L 59.64,77.72\n\nThis sequence of commands indicates that the path is composed of 6 line segments connecting 6 points. This suggests that the shape is a hexagon, as a hexagon is a polygon with 6 sides.\n\nTherefore, the shape drawn by the SVG path is a hexagon.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
