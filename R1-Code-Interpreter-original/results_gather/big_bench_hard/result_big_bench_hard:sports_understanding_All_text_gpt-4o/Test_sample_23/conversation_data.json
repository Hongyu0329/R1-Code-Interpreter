    "To determine whether the sentence \"Gerard Pique scored a corner kick\" is plausible, we need to analyze the components of the sentence and the context of soccer (football) rules and gameplay.\n\n1. **Understanding the Terms:**\n   - **Gerard Pique:** A professional footballer known for playing as a central defender, primarily for FC Barcelona and the Spanish national team.\n   - **Scored:** In football, to score means to put the ball into the opponent's goal, resulting in a point.\n   - **Corner Kick:** A method of restarting play in a football match. It is awarded when the ball goes out of play over the goal line, last touched by a defending player, and is taken from the corner of the field nearest to where the ball went out.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Sentence:**\n   - The sentence suggests that Gerard Pique directly scored a goal from a corner kick.\n   - In football, it is extremely rare for a player to score directly from a corner kick. This is known as an \"Olympic goal\" or \"gol ol√≠mpico.\" While rare, it is not impossible.\n\n3. **Plausibility:**\n   - While Gerard Pique is primarily a defender and not typically the player to take corner kicks, it is not outside the realm of possibility for him to take one, especially in a situation where he might be filling in for another player.\n   - Scoring directly from a corner kick is rare but plausible. It requires the ball to be kicked with enough curve and precision to enter the goal without being touched by another player.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sentence is plausible in the sense that it is possible, though unlikely, for Gerard Pique to score directly from a corner kick. The rarity of such an event does not make it impossible.\n\n<<<answer>>>The sentence is plausible, though unlikely."
