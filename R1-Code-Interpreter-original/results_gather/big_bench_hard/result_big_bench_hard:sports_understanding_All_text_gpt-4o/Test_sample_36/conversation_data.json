He has played in the NBA, which is the context in which this sentence is likely set.\n\n2. **Understanding the Action**:\n   - The action in question is \"committed a three second violation.\" In basketball, a three-second violation is a rule infraction that occurs when an offensive player remains in the key (the painted area near the basket) for more than three seconds while their team has control of the ball.\n\n3. **Contextual Plausibility**:\n   - Since Malik Beasley is a professional basketball player, it is entirely plausible that he could commit a three-second violation during a game. This is a common infraction that can happen to any player, regardless of their skill level, especially in the fast-paced environment of an NBA game.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Malik Beasley is a basketball player and the three-second violation is a common rule in basketball, the sentence is plausible. There is no information in the sentence that contradicts known facts about Malik Beasley or the rules of basketball.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"Malik Beasley committed a three second violation\" is plausible.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is plausible."
