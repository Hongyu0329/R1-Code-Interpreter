  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Ramires scored a header goal\" is plausible, we need to analyze several aspects:\n\n1. **Identify Ramires**: \n   - Ramires is a Brazilian professional footballer known for his time at clubs like Chelsea FC and the Brazilian national team. He is primarily a midfielder.\n\n2. **Understand the action described**:\n   - The sentence states that Ramires scored a goal using a header. In football, a header is when a player uses their head to direct the ball, often to score a goal.\n\n3. **Assess the plausibility**:\n   - Ramires, being a professional footballer, has the skills necessary to score goals, including using his head. \n   - Midfielders, although not primarily known for scoring goals, do occasionally score, including through headers, especially during set pieces like corners or free kicks.\n   - Ramires has been known for his versatility and ability to contribute to both defense and attack, making it plausible for him to score a header goal.\n\n4. **Consider historical context**:\n   - If there are records or instances of Ramires scoring goals with his head in past matches, this would further support the plausibility. However, even without specific historical instances, the action remains plausible given his professional background.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given Ramires's professional background and the nature of football, it is entirely plausible for him to have scored a goal using a header.\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes, the sentence \"Ramires scored a header goal\" is plausible."
