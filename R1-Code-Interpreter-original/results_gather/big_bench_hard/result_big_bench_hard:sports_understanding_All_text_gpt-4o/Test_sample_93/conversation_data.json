    "To determine if the sentence \"Sean Couturier maradona'd the defender\" is plausible, we need to analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject**: \n   - Sean Couturier is a professional ice hockey player from Canada, known for playing in the NHL.\n\n2. **Understand the Verb \"maradona'd\"**:\n   - The term \"maradona'd\" is derived from Diego Maradona, a famous Argentine soccer player. It refers to a specific move in soccer known as the \"Maradona turn\" or \"Maradona spin,\" where a player spins around with the ball to evade a defender.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The sentence implies that Sean Couturier performed a move associated with soccer, specifically a move named after a soccer legend, on a defender.\n   - Since Sean Couturier is an ice hockey player, the context of performing a soccer move in a hockey game is unusual.\n\n4. **Plausibility in Sports Context**:\n   - While it is possible for athletes to use techniques from other sports, the specific move \"maradona'd\" is not typically applicable in ice hockey due to the differences in playing surfaces, equipment, and rules.\n   - However, the sentence could be metaphorically plausible if it is used to describe a similar evasive maneuver in hockey, but this would be more of a creative or humorous expression rather than a literal description.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The sentence is not literally plausible because the \"Maradona turn\" is a soccer move and Sean Couturier is a hockey player. However, it could be metaphorically plausible if used in a creative or humorous context to describe an evasive move in hockey.\n\n<<<answer>>>The sentence is not literally plausible, but it could be metaphorically plausible in a creative context."
