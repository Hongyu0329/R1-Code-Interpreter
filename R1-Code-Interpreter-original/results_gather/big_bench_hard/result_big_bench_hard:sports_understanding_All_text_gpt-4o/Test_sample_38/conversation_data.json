    "To determine if the sentence \"T.Y. Hilton threw a touchdown in the AFC divisional round\" is plausible, we need to analyze several aspects:\n\n1. **Understanding the Player's Role:**\n   - T.Y. Hilton is a professional American football player known primarily as a wide receiver. Wide receivers are typically responsible for catching passes, not throwing them. \n\n2. **Position Responsibilities:**\n   - In American football, the player who usually throws touchdowns is the quarterback. While it is not impossible for a wide receiver to throw a pass, it is uncommon and usually occurs during trick plays.\n\n3. **Historical Context:**\n   - We should consider if there is any historical precedent or record of T.Y. Hilton throwing a touchdown pass in any game, particularly in the AFC divisional round. This would require checking game statistics or reports from past AFC divisional rounds.\n\n4. **Game Situations:**\n   - Trick plays, where non-quarterbacks throw passes, do occur in football, but they are rare and often memorable. If T.Y. Hilton had thrown a touchdown in such a high-stakes game, it would likely be well-documented.\n\n5. **Plausibility:**\n   - While it is technically possible for a wide receiver to throw a touchdown pass, the sentence's plausibility hinges on whether such an event has actually occurred or is likely to occur given T.Y. Hilton's typical role on the team.\n\nAfter considering these points, the sentence is not plausible based on T.Y. Hilton's known role as a wide receiver and the rarity of such events. There is no widely known record of him throwing a touchdown in an AFC divisional round game.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible."
