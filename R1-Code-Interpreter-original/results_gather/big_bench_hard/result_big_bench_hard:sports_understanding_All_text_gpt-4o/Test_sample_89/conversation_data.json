    "To determine if the sentence \"Dejounte Murray took a side-step three\" is plausible, we need to analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Subject**: \n   - Dejounte Murray is a professional basketball player. As of my last update, he played in the NBA, which is the highest level of professional basketball in the United States.\n\n2. **Understanding the Action**:\n   - \"Took a side-step three\" refers to a specific basketball move. A \"three\" in basketball refers to a three-point shot, which is a shot made from beyond the three-point line, earning the team three points.\n   - A \"side-step\" is a move where the player steps to the side to create space from the defender before taking a shot. This is a common move used by players to get a clearer shot at the basket, especially from the three-point line.\n\n3. **Plausibility of the Action**:\n   - Dejounte Murray, being a professional basketball player, is likely to have the skills necessary to perform a side-step three-point shot. This move is not uncommon in professional basketball and is often used by players to evade defenders and take a shot from beyond the arc.\n   - The move is plausible for a player of his caliber, as NBA players frequently practice and execute various types of shots, including the side-step three.\n\n4. **Contextual Considerations**:\n   - There is no specific context provided in the sentence that would make the action implausible. For instance, if the sentence mentioned a situation where a side-step three would be impossible (like during a free throw), it would be implausible. However, the sentence as it stands does not provide any such context.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Dejounte Murray is a professional basketball player and the action described is a common basketball move, the sentence is plausible.\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes, the sentence \"Dejounte Murray took a side-step three\" is plausible."
