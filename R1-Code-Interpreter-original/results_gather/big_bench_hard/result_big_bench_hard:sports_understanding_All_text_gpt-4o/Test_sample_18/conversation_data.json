    "To determine if the sentence \"Tom Brady converted the first down\" is plausible, we need to analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject**: The subject of the sentence is \"Tom Brady.\" Tom Brady is a well-known professional American football player, primarily recognized for his role as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL).\n\n2. **Understand the Action**: The action in the sentence is \"converted the first down.\" In American football, converting a first down means successfully advancing the ball past the line to gain at least 10 yards from the starting point of the current set of downs, thereby earning a new set of downs.\n\n3. **Role of a Quarterback**: As a quarterback, Tom Brady's primary responsibilities include passing the ball to receivers, handing it off to running backs, and occasionally running with the ball himself. All these actions can contribute to converting a first down.\n\n4. **Plausibility Check**: Given Tom Brady's position and role on the field, it is entirely plausible for him to be involved in converting a first down. He could achieve this by completing a pass to a receiver who gains the necessary yardage, or by running the ball himself for the required distance.\n\n5. **Contextual Consideration**: The sentence does not provide specific details about how the first down was converted, but it is common in football commentary to attribute the conversion to the quarterback, especially if they played a significant role in the play.\n\nBased on the analysis, the sentence \"Tom Brady converted the first down\" is plausible within the context of American football.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is plausible."
