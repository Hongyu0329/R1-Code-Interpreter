    "To determine if the sentence \"Nazem Kadri was out at home\" is plausible, we need to analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject**: The subject of the sentence is \"Nazem Kadri.\" Nazem Kadri is a professional ice hockey player, known for playing in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\n2. **Understand the Context**: The phrase \"out at home\" can have multiple interpretations depending on the context:\n   - In a **sports context**, particularly baseball, \"out at home\" refers to a player being tagged out at home plate while trying to score a run.\n   - In a **general context**, \"out at home\" could mean someone is not present at their residence.\n\n3. **Relevance to Nazem Kadri**:\n   - **Baseball Context**: Nazem Kadri is not a baseball player, so the sports-related interpretation of being \"out at home\" in a baseball game does not apply to him.\n   - **General Context**: If we consider the general meaning, it could simply mean that Nazem Kadri was not at his home at a certain time. This is a plausible scenario for any individual, including Nazem Kadri.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the sentence does not specify a context, and considering Nazem Kadri's profession, the most plausible interpretation is the general one, where \"out at home\" means he was not present at his residence. This is a common and plausible situation for anyone.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"Nazem Kadri was out at home\" is plausible when interpreted in the general context of someone not being at their residence.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes, the sentence is plausible."
