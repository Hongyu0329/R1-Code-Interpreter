  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Tyler Boyd hit the screen pass in the NFC divisional round\" is plausible, we need to analyze each component of the sentence:\n\n1. **Tyler Boyd**: \n   - Tyler Boyd is a professional American football player known for playing as a wide receiver. As of the latest information, he plays for the Cincinnati Bengals in the National Football League (NFL).\n\n2. **Screen Pass**:\n   - A screen pass is a type of play in American football where the quarterback throws a short pass to a receiver, typically a running back or wide receiver, who is positioned behind the line of scrimmage. The offensive linemen usually move downfield to block for the receiver.\n\n3. **NFC Divisional Round**:\n   - The NFC (National Football Conference) is one of the two conferences in the NFL, the other being the AFC (American Football Conference). The divisional round is part of the NFL playoffs, where the top teams from each conference compete to advance to the conference championship game.\n\n4. **Team Affiliation**:\n   - Tyler Boyd plays for the Cincinnati Bengals, which is a team in the AFC, not the NFC. Therefore, he would not be participating in the NFC divisional round, as that is reserved for teams within the NFC.\n\n5. **Plausibility**:\n   - Given that Tyler Boyd is an AFC player, it is not plausible for him to be involved in a play during the NFC divisional round. The sentence would only be plausible if it referred to the AFC divisional round, where the Cincinnati Bengals could potentially play.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentence is not plausible because Tyler Boyd, as a player for an AFC team, would not participate in an NFC divisional round game.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible."
