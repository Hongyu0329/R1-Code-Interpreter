In baseball, a player can be \"out\" at a base if they are tagged by a fielder with the ball or if the fielder touches the base with the ball before the runner arrives.\n\n2. **Identifying the Subject**:\n   - \"Luis Robert\" is a professional baseball player, known for playing in Major League Baseball (MLB). This adds credibility to the scenario being a baseball context.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Action**:\n   - \"Was out at second\" suggests that Luis Robert was attempting to reach second base but was put out by the opposing team. This is a common occurrence in baseball, where players attempt to advance bases and can be put out in various ways (e.g., caught stealing, forced out, tagged out).\n\n4. **Plausibility Check**:\n   - Given that Luis Robert is a known baseball player and the action described is a routine part of baseball games, the sentence is plausible. It describes a typical event that can happen during a baseball game.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is nothing unusual or implausible about the sentence.
