  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Courtland Sutton hit a triple\" is plausible, we need to analyze the components of the sentence and the context in which they are used.\n\n1. **Identify the Subject**: \n   - Courtland Sutton is a professional athlete known for playing in the National Football League (NFL) as a wide receiver for the Denver Broncos. His primary sport is American football.\n\n2. **Understand the Action**:\n   - The phrase \"hit a triple\" is a term commonly used in baseball. A \"triple\" occurs when a batter hits the ball and successfully reaches third base without being put out, and without the benefit of a fielding error.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Since Courtland Sutton is known for playing football, the action of hitting a triple does not align with his professional sports career. \n   - If the sentence were referring to a different context, such as Sutton participating in a baseball game or a charity event involving baseball, it might be plausible. However, without additional context, the sentence suggests an action that is not typical for a football player.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the information available, the sentence is not plausible in the context of Courtland Sutton's known professional activities. It would require additional context to make sense, such as him participating in a baseball game.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible without additional context."
