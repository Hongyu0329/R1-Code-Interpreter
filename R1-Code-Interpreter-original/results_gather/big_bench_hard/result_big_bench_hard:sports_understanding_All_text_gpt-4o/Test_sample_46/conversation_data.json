  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"DJ Chark caught the back shoulder fade in the NFC divisional round\" is plausible, we need to analyze several components:\n\n1. **Identify DJ Chark**: DJ Chark is a professional American football player. As of the latest information, he is a wide receiver in the NFL. We need to verify if he is likely to participate in an NFC divisional round game.\n\n2. **Team Affiliation**: Check which team DJ Chark is currently playing for. As of the latest data, DJ Chark was playing for the Carolina Panthers, which is an NFC team. This means he could potentially participate in an NFC divisional round game if his team qualifies.\n\n3. **NFC Divisional Round**: The NFC divisional round is part of the NFL playoffs. It involves the top teams from the NFC conference. For DJ Chark to catch a pass in this round, his team must have advanced to this stage of the playoffs.\n\n4. **Back Shoulder Fade**: This is a type of pass in football where the quarterback throws the ball to the receiver's back shoulder, away from the defender. It is a common and plausible play in football, especially for a wide receiver like DJ Chark.\n\n5. **Plausibility Check**: \n   - If DJ Chark's team (Carolina Panthers) made it to the NFC divisional round, it is plausible for him to catch a back shoulder fade pass during the game.\n   - If the Panthers did not make it to the playoffs or were eliminated before the divisional round, then the sentence would not be plausible.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without specific information on whether the Carolina Panthers reached the NFC divisional round in the most recent season, we cannot definitively say if the sentence is plausible. However, given that DJ Chark is a wide receiver for an NFC team, the scenario described is plausible under the condition that his team reached the divisional round.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is plausible if DJ Chark's team reached the NFC divisional round."
