    "To determine if the sentence \"Adam Thielen got on base\" is plausible, we need to analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject**: The subject of the sentence is \"Adam Thielen.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Action**: The action in the sentence is \"got on base.\"\n\n3. **Understand the Context of the Action**: \n   - \"Got on base\" is a phrase commonly used in baseball. It refers to a player reaching one of the bases (first, second, or third) safely, typically through a hit, walk, or error.\n\n4. **Identify Adam Thielen**:\n   - Adam Thielen is a professional athlete known for playing in the National Football League (NFL) as a wide receiver. He is not known for playing professional baseball.\n\n5. **Assess the Plausibility**:\n   - Since Adam Thielen is known for playing football and not baseball, the sentence is not plausible in the context of his professional career. \n   - If the sentence were referring to a casual or recreational baseball game, it might be plausible, but without additional context, it is unlikely.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the information available, the sentence is not plausible in the context of professional sports, as Adam Thielen is not a baseball player.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible."
