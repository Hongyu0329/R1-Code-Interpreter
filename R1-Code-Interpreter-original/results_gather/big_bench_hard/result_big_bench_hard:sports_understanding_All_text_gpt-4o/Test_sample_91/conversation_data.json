    "To determine if the sentence \"Josh Allen hit the screen pass\" is plausible, we need to analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject**: \n   - \"Josh Allen\" is the subject of the sentence. Josh Allen is a well-known professional American football quarterback who plays in the NFL.\n\n2. **Understand the Action**:\n   - The verb in the sentence is \"hit.\" In the context of American football, \"hit\" can mean to physically make contact with something or someone, or it can be used metaphorically to mean successfully executing a play.\n\n3. **Understand the Object**:\n   - The object of the sentence is \"the screen pass.\" A screen pass is a specific type of play in American football where the quarterback throws a short pass to a receiver, typically a running back or wide receiver, who is behind the line of scrimmage. The offensive linemen then move downfield to block for the receiver.\n\n4. **Analyze the Plausibility**:\n   - In football terminology, a quarterback \"throws\" a pass rather than \"hits\" it. The term \"hit\" is not typically used to describe the action of executing a screen pass. Therefore, the sentence \"Josh Allen hit the screen pass\" is not standard football terminology.\n   - However, if we interpret \"hit\" metaphorically as successfully executing or completing the screen pass, it could be considered plausible in a more casual or metaphorical sense. But this is not the conventional way to describe the action.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the sentence could be understood metaphorically, it is not a standard or conventional way to describe a quarterback executing a screen pass in football. Therefore, it is not plausible in the context of standard football terminology.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible in standard football terminology."
