    "To determine if the sentence \"Freddie Freeman watched the pitch go by\" is plausible, we need to analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject**: The subject of the sentence is \"Freddie Freeman.\" We need to determine if this is a plausible subject for the action described.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: Freddie Freeman is a well-known professional baseball player. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) and is recognized for his skills as a hitter and fielder. This context is important because it relates to the action described in the sentence.\n\n3. **Action Described**: The action in the sentence is \"watched the pitch go by.\" In baseball, a \"pitch\" refers to the ball thrown by the pitcher towards the batter. \"Watching the pitch go by\" implies that the batter did not swing at the pitch and instead observed it as it passed.\n\n4. **Plausibility of the Action**: It is common in baseball for batters to watch pitches go by, especially if they are assessing the pitcher's style, waiting for a better pitch to hit, or if the pitch is outside the strike zone. Given Freddie Freeman's experience and role as a batter, it is entirely plausible for him to watch a pitch go by during a game.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Considering Freddie Freeman's background as a professional baseball player and the common occurrence of batters watching pitches in baseball, the sentence is plausible.\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes, the sentence \"Freddie Freeman watched the pitch go by\" is plausible."
