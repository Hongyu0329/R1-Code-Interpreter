  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Jakub Vrana hit a walkoff homer\" is plausible, we need to analyze several aspects:\n\n1. **Understanding the Terms:**\n   - **Jakub Vrana:** He is a professional ice hockey player, not a baseball player. He is known for playing in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n   - **Walkoff Homer:** This is a term used in baseball. A \"walkoff home run\" is a home run that ends the game, giving the home team the lead in the final inning.\n\n2. **Contextual Plausibility:**\n   - Since Jakub Vrana is an ice hockey player, it is unlikely that he would be involved in a baseball game, let alone hit a walkoff home run.\n   - The term \"walkoff homer\" is specific to baseball, and it would not apply to any situation in ice hockey.\n\n3. **Cross-Sport Participation:**\n   - While athletes sometimes participate in sports other than their primary one, it is rare for a professional athlete to switch sports at a professional level, especially from hockey to baseball.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that Jakub Vrana is not a baseball player and the term \"walkoff homer\" is specific to baseball, the sentence is not plausible in a literal sense.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"Jakub Vrana hit a walkoff homer\" is not plausible.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible."
