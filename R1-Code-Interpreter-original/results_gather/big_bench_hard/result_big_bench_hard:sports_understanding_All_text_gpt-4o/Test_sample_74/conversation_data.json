  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Igor Shesterkin launched a hail mary\" is plausible, we need to analyze the components of the sentence and the context in which they are used.\n\n1. **Identify Igor Shesterkin**: Igor Shesterkin is a professional ice hockey goaltender. As of the latest information, he plays for the New York Rangers in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\n2. **Understand \"hail mary\"**: The term \"hail mary\" is commonly used in American football. It refers to a long, desperate pass thrown by the quarterback, usually at the end of a game, in an attempt to score a touchdown. The term is not typically associated with ice hockey.\n\n3. **Contextual Plausibility**: \n   - In ice hockey, goaltenders like Igor Shesterkin are primarily responsible for preventing the opposing team from scoring by blocking shots on goal. They do not typically engage in offensive plays like launching a \"hail mary\" pass.\n   - While it is possible for a goaltender to make a long pass or clear the puck down the ice, this action is not commonly referred to as a \"hail mary\" in the context of ice hockey.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that \"hail mary\" is a term specific to American football and not typically used in ice hockey, and considering Igor Shesterkin's role as a goaltender, the sentence is not plausible in the context of ice hockey.\n\n<<<answer>>>The sentence is not plausible."
