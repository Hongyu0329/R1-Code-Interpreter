    "To determine if the sentence \"Robin Lehner launched the desperation heave\" is plausible, we need to analyze each component of the sentence and consider the context in which it might be used.\n\n1. **Identify Robin Lehner**: \n   - Robin Lehner is a professional ice hockey goaltender. He has played in the NHL for teams such as the Ottawa Senators, Buffalo Sabres, New York Islanders, Chicago Blackhawks, and Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n2. **Understand \"desperation heave\"**:\n   - The term \"desperation heave\" is commonly used in sports, particularly in basketball and American football, to describe a last-second, long-distance attempt to score. In basketball, it might refer to a long shot taken as time expires. In football, it could refer to a long pass thrown in a last-ditch effort to score.\n\n3. **Contextual Plausibility**:\n   - In ice hockey, the term \"desperation heave\" is not typically used. Hockey has its own terminology for last-second plays, such as \"last-second shot\" or \"buzzer-beater\" (though the latter is more common in basketball).\n   - As a goaltender, Robin Lehner's primary role is to prevent goals, not to score them. While it is not impossible for a goaltender to attempt a long shot (e.g., when the opposing net is empty), it is rare and not typically described as a \"desperation heave.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Robin Lehner is a goaltender and the term \"desperation heave\" is not commonly associated with ice hockey, the sentence is not plausible in the context of hockey. It would be more plausible if it referred to a player in a sport where \"desperation heave\" is a common term, such as basketball or football.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible."
