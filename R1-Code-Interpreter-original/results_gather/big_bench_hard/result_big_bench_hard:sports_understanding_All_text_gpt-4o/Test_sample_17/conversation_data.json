  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Adam Thielen scored in added time\" is plausible, we need to analyze several aspects:\n\n1. **Identify Adam Thielen**: \n   - Adam Thielen is a professional American football player. As of the latest information, he is known for playing as a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL).\n\n2. **Understand the term \"added time\"**:\n   - \"Added time\" is a term commonly used in soccer (association football) to refer to the extra minutes added at the end of a match to compensate for stoppages during the game. It is not a term typically used in American football.\n\n3. **Contextual relevance**:\n   - In American football, the equivalent of \"added time\" would be overtime, which occurs if the game is tied at the end of regulation time. However, the term \"added time\" is not used in the context of American football.\n\n4. **Plausibility assessment**:\n   - Given that Adam Thielen is an American football player and \"added time\" is a term used in soccer, the sentence is not plausible in the context of American football. If the sentence were referring to a soccer match, it would be plausible, but Adam Thielen is not known to play professional soccer.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The sentence is not plausible because it incorrectly uses a soccer term in the context of an American football player.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible."
