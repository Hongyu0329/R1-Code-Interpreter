  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Brandin Cooks went for it on fourth down\" is plausible, we need to analyze the components of the sentence and the context in which it is used.\n\n1. **Understanding the Subject**: \n   - Brandin Cooks is a professional American football player known for playing as a wide receiver. He has played for several teams in the NFL, including the New Orleans Saints, New England Patriots, Los Angeles Rams, and Houston Texans.\n\n2. **Understanding the Action**:\n   - \"Went for it on fourth down\" is a phrase commonly used in American football. It refers to a team deciding to attempt to gain a first down or score on the fourth down, rather than punting or attempting a field goal. This is typically a decision made by the team's coach or the quarterback, not an individual player like a wide receiver.\n\n3. **Role of a Wide Receiver**:\n   - As a wide receiver, Brandin Cooks' primary role is to catch passes from the quarterback. He is not typically involved in making strategic decisions such as whether to go for it on fourth down. Such decisions are usually made by the coaching staff or the quarterback.\n\n4. **Plausibility of the Sentence**:\n   - The sentence implies that Brandin Cooks, as an individual, made the decision to go for it on fourth down. This is not plausible because individual players, especially wide receivers, do not make such strategic decisions. The decision to go for it on fourth down is a team decision, typically made by the coach or the quarterback.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the role of Brandin Cooks as a wide receiver and the nature of the decision-making process in football, the sentence is not plausible. It inaccurately attributes a team decision to an individual player who is not in a position to make such decisions.\n\n<<<answer>>> The sentence is not plausible."
