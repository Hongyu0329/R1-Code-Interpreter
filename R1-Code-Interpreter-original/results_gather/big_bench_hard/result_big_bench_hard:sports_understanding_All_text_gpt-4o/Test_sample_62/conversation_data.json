He is known for his height, physical presence, and ability to score goals, particularly with his head.\n\n2. **Understand the context of \"extra time\"**:\n   - In football, \"extra time\" refers to the additional period played if a match is tied after the regular 90 minutes, typically in knockout competitions. It consists of two 15-minute halves.\n\n3. **Assess the plausibility of Fellaini scoring in extra time**:\n   - Given Fellaini's position as a midfielder and his known ability to score goals, it is plausible for him to score during any part of a match, including extra time. His physical attributes and playing style make him a threat in set-piece situations, which are common in extra time as teams look for decisive goals.\n\n4. **Consider historical context**:\n   - Historically, Fellaini has scored important goals in various matches, including those that went into extra time.
