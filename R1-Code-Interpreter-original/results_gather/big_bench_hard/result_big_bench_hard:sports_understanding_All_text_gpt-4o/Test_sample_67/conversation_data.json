  "response_list": [
    "To determine if the sentence \"Jordan Binnington scored in the third period\" is plausible, we need to analyze several aspects:\n\n1. **Identify Jordan Binnington**: Jordan Binnington is a professional ice hockey goaltender who plays for the St. Louis Blues in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\n2. **Role of a Goaltender**: In ice hockey, the primary role of a goaltender is to prevent the opposing team from scoring by blocking shots on goal. Goaltenders typically do not score goals themselves, as they spend most of the game in or near their own net.\n\n3. **Scoring by Goaltenders**: While it is rare, goaltenders can score goals. This usually happens in specific situations, such as when the opposing team has pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker, and the goaltender manages to shoot the puck into the empty net. However, such occurrences are uncommon.\n\n4. **Plausibility of the Sentence**: Given that Jordan Binnington is a goaltender, the sentence \"Jordan Binnington scored in the third period\" is not impossible, but it is highly unlikely. It would require a rare situation where Binnington either directly shot the puck into the opposing net or was credited with a goal under unusual circumstances.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the sentence is not impossible, it is implausible under normal circumstances in a hockey game. The rarity of goaltenders scoring goals makes the statement unlikely, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility.\n\n<<<answer>>>The sentence is implausible."
