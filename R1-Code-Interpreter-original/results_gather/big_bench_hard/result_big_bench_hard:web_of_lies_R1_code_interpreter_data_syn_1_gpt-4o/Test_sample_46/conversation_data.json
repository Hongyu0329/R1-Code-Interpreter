    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine the truthfulness of each person involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Millie tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Millie tells the truth.\n\n2. **Millicent says Millie tells the truth.**\n   - If Millicent is telling the truth, then Millie indeed tells the truth, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\n3. **Raymond says Millicent tells the truth.**\n   - If Raymond is telling the truth, then Millicent tells the truth, which means Millie tells the truth.\n\n4. **Crista says Raymond lies.**\n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Raymond is lying, which means Millicent does not tell the truth, contradicting our previous assumption.\n\n5. **Ka says Crista tells the truth.**\n   - If Ka is telling the truth, then Crista tells the truth, which means Raymond is lying.\n\nLet's analyze the implications:\n\n- If Millie tells the truth, then Millicent tells the truth, and Raymond tells the truth. However, this contradicts Crista's statement that Raymond lies.\n- If Crista tells the truth, then Raymond lies, which means Millicent does not tell the truth, contradicting the assumption that Millie tells the truth.\n\nTo resolve this, let's consider the possibility that Millie does not tell the truth:\n\n- If Millie does not tell the truth, then Millicent does not tell the truth, and Raymond does not tell the truth.\n- If Raymond does not tell the truth, then Crista tells the truth.\n- If Crista tells the truth, then Ka tells the truth.\n\nThis scenario is consistent and does not lead to any contradictions. Therefore, Ka tells the truth.\n\n<<<Ka tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Millie tells the truth.
