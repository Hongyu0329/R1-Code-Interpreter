    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Amberly lies.\n2. Shenna says Amberly tells the truth.\n3. Willian says Shenna tells the truth.\n4. Raymond says Willian lies.\n5. Sal says Raymond lies.\n\nWe need to determine if Sal tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Since Amberly lies, Shenna's statement that \"Amberly tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Shenna lies.\n- Willian says Shenna tells the truth, but since Shenna lies, Willian's statement is false. Therefore, Willian lies.\n- Raymond says Willian lies, and since Willian does lie, Raymond's statement is true. Therefore, Raymond tells the truth.\n- Sal says Raymond lies, but since Raymond tells the truth, Sal's statement is false. Therefore, Sal lies.\n\nNow, let's confirm this logic using a simple Python script to verify the truthfulness of each statement.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\namberly_truth = False\nshenna_truth = amberly_truth  # Shenna says Amberly tells the truth\nwillian_truth = shenna_truth  # Willian says Shenna tells the truth\nraymond_truth = not willian_truth  # Raymond says Willian lies\nsal_truth = not raymond_truth  # Sal says Raymond lies\n\n# Output whether Sal tells the truth\nprint(sal_truth)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Sal does not tell the truth, which aligns with our logical reasoning. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Sal does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Amberly lies.
