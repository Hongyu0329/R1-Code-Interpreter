    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We can do this by analyzing the statements and checking for consistency.\n\n1. **Fidel lies.** - This is the initial statement. We don't have any information to verify this yet.\n\n2. **Michael says Fidel lies.** - If Michael is telling the truth, then Fidel indeed lies. If Michael is lying, then Fidel tells the truth.\n\n3. **Fletcher says Michael lies.** - If Fletcher is telling the truth, then Michael is lying, which means Fidel tells the truth. If Fletcher is lying, then Michael is telling the truth, which means Fidel lies.\n\n4. **Inga says Fletcher tells the truth.** - If Inga is telling the truth, then Fletcher is telling the truth, which means Michael is lying, and Fidel tells the truth. If Inga is lying, then Fletcher is lying, which means Michael is telling the truth, and Fidel lies.\n\n5. **Andree says Inga lies.** - If Andree is telling the truth, then Inga is lying, which means Fletcher is lying, Michael is telling the truth, and Fidel lies. If Andree is lying, then Inga is telling the truth, which means Fletcher is telling the truth, Michael is lying, and Fidel tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Andree tells the truth, then Inga lies, Fletcher lies, Michael tells the truth, and Fidel lies. This scenario is consistent.\n- If Andree lies, then Inga tells the truth, Fletcher tells the truth, Michael lies, and Fidel tells the truth. This scenario is also consistent.\n\nSince both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is more likely based on the given statements. Let's write a Python script to evaluate these scenarios and determine if Andree tells the truth.\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_statements():\n    # Scenario 1: Andree tells the truth\n    andree_truth = True\n    inga_lies = True\n    fletcher_lies = True\n    michael_truth = True\n    fidel_lies = True\n\n    # Scenario 2: Andree lies\n    andree_lies = True\n    inga_truth = True\n    fletcher_truth = True\n    michael_lies = True\n    fidel_truth = True\n\n    # Check consistency of both scenarios\n    scenario_1_consistent = inga_lies and fletcher_lies and michael_truth and fidel_lies\n    scenario_2_consistent = inga_truth and fletcher_truth and michael_lies and fidel_truth\n\n    return scenario_1_consistent, scenario_2_consistent\n\nscenario_1, scenario_2 = evaluate_statements()\nprint(\"Scenario 1 (Andree tells the truth) is consistent:\", scenario_1)\nprint(\"Scenario 2 (Andree lies) is consistent:\", scenario_2)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to see which scenario is consistent.",
    "The code output indicates that both scenarios are consistent, meaning that both possibilities (Andree telling the truth and Andree lying) can logically coexist based on the given statements. However, since the problem asks specifically whether Andree tells the truth, we need to determine if there is a unique solution or if both scenarios are equally valid.\n\nGiven that both scenarios are consistent, it implies that the problem does not have a unique solution based solely on the information provided. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Andree tells the truth or not without additional information.\n\n<<<answer: The problem does not have a unique solution based on the given statements. Both scenarios where Andree tells the truth and where Andree lies are consistent. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if Andree tells the truth.>>>"
