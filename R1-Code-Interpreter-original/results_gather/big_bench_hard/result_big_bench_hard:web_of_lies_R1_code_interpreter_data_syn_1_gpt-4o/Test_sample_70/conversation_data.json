    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. **Kandi lies.**\n2. **Phoebe says Kandi tells the truth.**\n3. **Yoland says Phoebe tells the truth.**\n4. **Fletcher says Yoland lies.**\n5. **Lorine says Fletcher tells the truth.**\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- If Kandi lies, then Phoebe's statement that \"Kandi tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Phoebe lies.\n- If Phoebe lies, then Yoland's statement that \"Phoebe tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Yoland lies.\n- If Yoland lies, then Fletcher's statement that \"Yoland lies\" is true. Therefore, Fletcher tells the truth.\n- If Fletcher tells the truth, then Lorine's statement that \"Fletcher tells the truth\" is true. Therefore, Lorine tells the truth.\n\nThus, based on the logical consistency of the statements, Lorine tells the truth.\n\n<<<Lorine tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Kandi lies.
