    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Amberly tells the truth.**  \n   - This is a given statement. So, Amberly is truthful.\n\n2. **Jamey says Amberly tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Amberly is truthful, Jamey's statement is true. Therefore, Jamey is also truthful.\n\n3. **Shalonda says Jamey lies.**  \n   - Since Jamey is truthful, Shalonda's statement is false. Therefore, Shalonda is lying.\n\n4. **Antwan says Shalonda tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Shalonda is lying, Antwan's statement is false. Therefore, Antwan is lying.\n\n5. **Alejandro says Antwan lies.**  \n   - Since Antwan is lying, Alejandro's statement is true. Therefore, Alejandro is truthful.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Alejandro tells the truth. \n\nLet's confirm this logic with a simple Python script to ensure the consistency of our reasoning.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\namberly_truthful = True\njamey_truthful = amberly_truthful\nshalonda_truthful = not jamey_truthful\nantwan_truthful = shalonda_truthful\nalejandro_truthful = not antwan_truthful\n\n# Output the truthfulness of Alejandro\nprint(alejandro_truthful)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether Alejandro is truthful or not. Let's execute it.",
    "The code output confirms that Alejandro is indeed truthful. Based on the logical deductions and the code verification, we can conclude:\n\n<<<Alejandro tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Amberly tells the truth.
