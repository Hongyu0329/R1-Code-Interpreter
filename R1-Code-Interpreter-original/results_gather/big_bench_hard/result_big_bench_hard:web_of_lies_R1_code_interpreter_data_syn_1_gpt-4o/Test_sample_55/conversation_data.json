    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical implications of their statements.\n\n1. **Kandi tells the truth.**  \n   - This is our starting point. If Kandi tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Alejandro says Kandi tells the truth.**  \n   - If Alejandro is telling the truth, then Kandi indeed tells the truth, which is consistent with our starting point.\n\n3. **Millicent says Alejandro lies.**  \n   - If Millicent is telling the truth, then Alejandro is lying, which contradicts our assumption that Alejandro is telling the truth. Therefore, Millicent must be lying.\n\n4. **Shalonda says Millicent lies.**  \n   - If Shalonda is telling the truth, then Millicent is indeed lying, which is consistent with our conclusion that Millicent is lying.\n\n5. **Conception says Shalonda lies.**  \n   - If Conception is telling the truth, then Shalonda is lying. However, we concluded that Shalonda is telling the truth. Therefore, Conception must be lying.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Conception does not tell the truth. \n\nLet's summarize the findings in a Python script to verify the logical consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_truth():\n    # Initial assumptions\n    kandi_truth = True  # Kandi tells the truth\n    alejandro_truth = kandi_truth  # Alejandro says Kandi tells the truth\n    millicent_truth = not alejandro_truth  # Millicent says Alejandro lies\n    shalonda_truth = not millicent_truth  # Shalonda says Millicent lies\n    conception_truth = not shalonda_truth  # Conception says Shalonda lies\n\n    return conception_truth\n\n# Output the result\nprint(check_truth())\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Conception does not tell the truth, which aligns with our logical deduction. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Conception does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Kandi tells the truth.
