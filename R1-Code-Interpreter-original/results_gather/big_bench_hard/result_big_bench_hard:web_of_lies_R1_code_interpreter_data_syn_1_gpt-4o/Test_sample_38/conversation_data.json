    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Maybelle lies.**\n2. **Jamey says Maybelle tells the truth.**\n3. **Phoebe says Jamey lies.**\n4. **Willian says Phoebe lies.**\n5. **Shalonda says Willian lies.**\n\nWe need to determine if Shalonda tells the truth. Let's break it down:\n\n- If Maybelle lies, then Jamey's statement that Maybelle tells the truth is false. Therefore, Jamey lies.\n- If Jamey lies, then Phoebe's statement that Jamey lies is true. Therefore, Phoebe tells the truth.\n- If Phoebe tells the truth, then Willian's statement that Phoebe lies is false. Therefore, Willian lies.\n- If Willian lies, then Shalonda's statement that Willian lies is true. Therefore, Shalonda tells the truth.\n\nLet's verify this logic with a simple Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values for each person\nmaybelle_lies = True\njamey_truth = not maybelle_lies\nphoebe_truth = not jamey_truth\nwillian_truth = not phoebe_truth\nshalonda_truth = not willian_truth\n\n# Check if Shalonda tells the truth\nprint(shalonda_truth)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Shalonda tells the truth. This confirms our logical reasoning that if Maybelle lies, then the chain of statements leads to Shalonda telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Shalonda tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Maybelle lies.
