    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Ka lies.\n2. Christie says Ka tells the truth.\n3. Jerry says Christie lies.\n4. Crista says Jerry lies.\n5. Yoland says Crista tells the truth.\n\nWe need to determine if Yoland tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Since Ka lies, Christie's statement that \"Ka tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Christie lies.\n- Jerry says Christie lies. Since Christie indeed lies, Jerry tells the truth.\n- Crista says Jerry lies. Since Jerry tells the truth, Crista lies.\n- Yoland says Crista tells the truth. Since Crista lies, Yoland's statement is false.\n\nTherefore, Yoland does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<answer\nNo, Yoland does not tell the truth.\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Ka lies.
