    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement based on the given conditions. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Conception tells the truth.\n2. Teressa says Conception lies.\n3. Sal says Teressa tells the truth.\n4. Fidel says Sal tells the truth.\n5. Shenna says Fidel lies.\n\nWe need to determine if Shenna tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Conception tells the truth, then Teressa's statement that Conception lies is false. Therefore, Teressa lies.\n- If Teressa lies, then Sal's statement that Teressa tells the truth is false. Therefore, Sal lies.\n- If Sal lies, then Fidel's statement that Sal tells the truth is false. Therefore, Fidel lies.\n- If Fidel lies, then Shenna's statement that Fidel lies is true. Therefore, Shenna tells the truth.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Shenna tells the truth. \n\nLet's verify this reasoning with a simple Python script to ensure the logic holds:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values for each person\nconception_truth = True\nteressa_truth = not conception_truth\nsal_truth = teressa_truth\nfidel_truth = sal_truth\nshenna_truth = not fidel_truth\n\n# Check if Shenna tells the truth\nprint(shenna_truth)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether Shenna tells the truth based on the logical deductions made. Let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Shenna tells the truth, which aligns with our logical deduction. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Shenna tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Conception tells the truth.
