    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Jim lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. So, Jim is lying.\n\n2. **Ka says Jim lies.**\n   - If Ka is telling the truth, then Jim indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. So, Ka could be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Jerry says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - If Jerry is telling the truth, then Ka is telling the truth, which means Jim lies. This is consistent with the given statement. So, Jerry could be telling the truth.\n\n4. **Fletcher says Jerry tells the truth.**\n   - If Fletcher is telling the truth, then Jerry is telling the truth, which means Ka is telling the truth, and Jim lies. This is consistent with the given statement. So, Fletcher could be telling the truth.\n\n5. **Kandi says Fletcher lies.**\n   - If Kandi is telling the truth, then Fletcher is lying. But if Fletcher is lying, then Jerry is lying, which means Ka is lying, which contradicts the given statement that Jim lies. Therefore, Kandi cannot be telling the truth.\n\nThus, Kandi must be lying. Let's confirm this with a logical check using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nJim_lies = True\nKa_truth = Jim_lies\nJerry_truth = Ka_truth\nFletcher_truth = Jerry_truth\nKandi_truth = not Fletcher_truth\n\n# Print the result for Kandi\nprint(Kandi_truth)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether Kandi is telling the truth or not. Let's execute it.",
    "The code output indicates that Kandi is not telling the truth, which aligns with our logical deduction. Therefore, Kandi is lying.\n\n<<<Kandi does not tell the truth.>>>"
