    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Sherrie tells the truth.\n2. Vernell says Sherrie tells the truth.\n3. Alexis says Vernell lies.\n4. Michaela says Alexis tells the truth.\n5. Elanor says Michaela tells the truth.\n\nWe need to determine if Elanor tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Sherrie tells the truth, then Vernell's statement is also true because Vernell says Sherrie tells the truth.\n- If Vernell's statement is true, then Alexis's statement must be false because Alexis says Vernell lies.\n- If Alexis's statement is false, then Michaela's statement is also false because Michaela says Alexis tells the truth.\n- If Michaela's statement is false, then Elanor's statement is also false because Elanor says Michaela tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical deduction, Elanor does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Elanor does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Sherrie tells the truth.
