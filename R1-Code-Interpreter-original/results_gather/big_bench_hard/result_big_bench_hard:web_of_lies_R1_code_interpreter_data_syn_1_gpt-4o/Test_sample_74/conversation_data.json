    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Osvaldo tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Osvaldo tells the truth, then his statement is true.\n\n2. **Andree says Osvaldo tells the truth.**\n   - If Andree is telling the truth, then Osvaldo is indeed telling the truth.\n\n3. **Willian says Andree lies.**\n   - If Willian is telling the truth, then Andree is lying, which means Osvaldo is not telling the truth.\n\n4. **Vina says Willian tells the truth.**\n   - If Vina is telling the truth, then Willian is telling the truth, which means Andree is lying, and Osvaldo is not telling the truth.\n\n5. **Jaymie says Vina tells the truth.**\n   - If Jaymie is telling the truth, then Vina is telling the truth, which means Willian is telling the truth, Andree is lying, and Osvaldo is not telling the truth.\n\nLet's analyze the logical consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Osvaldo tells the truth, then Andree is telling the truth, which contradicts Willian's statement.\n- If Osvaldo is lying, then Andree is lying, which makes Willian's statement true, Vina's statement true, and Jaymie's statement true.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that Osvaldo is lying, Andree is lying, Willian is telling the truth, Vina is telling the truth, and Jaymie is telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, Jaymie tells the truth.\n\n<<<Yes, Jaymie tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Osvaldo tells the truth.
