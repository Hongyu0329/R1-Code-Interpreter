    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical consistency of their statements.\n\n1. **Bernita tells the truth.**\n2. **Michael says Bernita tells the truth.**\n3. **Fidel says Michael lies.**\n4. **Dallas says Fidel tells the truth.**\n5. **Millicent says Dallas lies.**\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n- If Bernita tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n- If Michael says Bernita tells the truth, and Bernita indeed tells the truth, then Michael is also telling the truth.\n- If Fidel says Michael lies, but Michael is telling the truth, then Fidel is lying.\n- If Dallas says Fidel tells the truth, but Fidel is lying, then Dallas is lying.\n- If Millicent says Dallas lies, and Dallas is indeed lying, then Millicent is telling the truth.\n\nNow, let's verify this logic using a Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nbernita_truth = True\nmichael_truth = bernita_truth\nfidel_truth = not michael_truth\ndallas_truth = fidel_truth\nmillicent_truth = not dallas_truth\n\n# Output the truth value of Millicent\nprint(millicent_truth)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if Millicent tells the truth.",
    "The code output indicates that Millicent tells the truth. Based on the logical analysis and the code execution, we can conclude that Millicent's statement is true.\n\n<<<Millicent tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Bernita tells the truth.
