    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency.\n\n1. **Fletcher lies.**  \n   - This is a given statement.\n\n2. **Phoebe says Fletcher tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Fletcher lies, Phoebe's statement is false. Therefore, Phoebe lies.\n\n3. **Vina says Phoebe tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Phoebe lies, Vina's statement is false. Therefore, Vina lies.\n\n4. **Andree says Vina tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Vina lies, Andree's statement is false. Therefore, Andree lies.\n\n5. **Willian says Andree tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Andree lies, Willian's statement is false. Therefore, Willian lies.\n\nBased on this chain of reasoning, we can conclude that Willian does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Willian lies.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Fletcher lies.
