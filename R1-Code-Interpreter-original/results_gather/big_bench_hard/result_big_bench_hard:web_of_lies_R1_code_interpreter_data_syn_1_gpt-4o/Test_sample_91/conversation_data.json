    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Antwan tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. Let's assume it is true.\n\n2. **Helene says Antwan tells the truth.**\n   - If Helene is telling the truth, then Antwan is indeed telling the truth, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\n3. **Gwenn says Helene tells the truth.**\n   - If Gwenn is telling the truth, then Helene is telling the truth, which means Antwan is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Sal says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n   - If Sal is telling the truth, then Gwenn is telling the truth, which means Helene is telling the truth, and thus Antwan is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Shaunda says Sal lies.**\n   - If Shaunda is telling the truth, then Sal is lying, which means Gwenn is not telling the truth, which means Helene is not telling the truth, which means Antwan is not telling the truth. This contradicts our initial assumption that Antwan tells the truth.\n\nSince assuming Shaunda tells the truth leads to a contradiction, Shaunda must be lying. Therefore, Sal is telling the truth, which means Gwenn is telling the truth, Helene is telling the truth, and Antwan is telling the truth.\n\nThus, Shaunda does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Shaunda does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Antwan tells the truth.
