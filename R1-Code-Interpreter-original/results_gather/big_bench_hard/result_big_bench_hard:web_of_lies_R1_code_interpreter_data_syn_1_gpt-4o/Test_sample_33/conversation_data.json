    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Jerry lies.** - This is a given fact.\n\n2. **Helene says Jerry lies.** - Since Jerry indeed lies, Helene is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Alexis says Helene tells the truth.** - Since Helene is telling the truth, Alexis is also telling the truth.\n\n4. **Sherrie says Alexis tells the truth.** - Since Alexis is telling the truth, Sherrie is also telling the truth.\n\n5. **Michael says Sherrie tells the truth.** - Since Sherrie is telling the truth, Michael is also telling the truth.\n\nBased on this chain of reasoning, we can conclude that Michael tells the truth.\n\n<<<Michael tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Jerry lies.
