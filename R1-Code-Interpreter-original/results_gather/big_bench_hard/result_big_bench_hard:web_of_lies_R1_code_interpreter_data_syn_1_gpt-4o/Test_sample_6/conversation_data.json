    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Shalonda lies.**\n   - This means Shalonda's statement is false.\n\n2. **Teressa says Shalonda tells the truth.**\n   - If Teressa is telling the truth, then Shalonda tells the truth, which contradicts the fact that Shalonda lies. Therefore, Teressa must be lying.\n\n3. **Tamika says Teressa lies.**\n   - Since Teressa is indeed lying, Tamika is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Lorine says Tamika tells the truth.**\n   - Since Tamika is telling the truth, Lorine is also telling the truth.\n\n5. **Jaymie says Lorine lies.**\n   - Since Lorine is telling the truth, Jaymie's statement is false.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n- Shalonda lies.\n- Teressa lies.\n- Tamika tells the truth.\n- Lorine tells the truth.\n- Jaymie lies.\n\nTherefore, Jaymie does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<No, Jaymie does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Shalonda lies.
