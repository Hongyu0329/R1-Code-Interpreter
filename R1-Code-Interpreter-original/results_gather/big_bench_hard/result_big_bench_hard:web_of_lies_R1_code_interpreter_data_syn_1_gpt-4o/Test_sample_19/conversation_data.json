    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We will analyze the statements logically:\n\n1. **Fidel lies.**\n2. **Sal says Fidel tells the truth.**\n3. **Osvaldo says Sal lies.**\n4. **Alexis says Osvaldo lies.**\n5. **Millie says Alexis tells the truth.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Fidel lies, then Sal's statement that Fidel tells the truth is false. Therefore, Sal lies.\n- If Sal lies, then Osvaldo's statement that Sal lies is true. Therefore, Osvaldo tells the truth.\n- If Osvaldo tells the truth, then Alexis's statement that Osvaldo lies is false. Therefore, Alexis lies.\n- If Alexis lies, then Millie's statement that Alexis tells the truth is false. Therefore, Millie lies.\n\nNow, let's verify this logic using a Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nFidel = False  # Fidel lies\nSal = not Fidel  # Sal says Fidel tells the truth\nOsvaldo = not Sal  # Osvaldo says Sal lies\nAlexis = not Osvaldo  # Alexis says Osvaldo lies\nMillie = Alexis  # Millie says Alexis tells the truth\n\n# Check if Millie tells the truth\nprint(Millie)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Millie's statement is true, which contradicts our initial logical deduction. Let's re-evaluate the logic:\n\n- If Fidel lies, then Sal's statement that Fidel tells the truth is false. Therefore, Sal lies.\n- If Sal lies, then Osvaldo's statement that Sal lies is true.
