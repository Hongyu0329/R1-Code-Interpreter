    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Shalonda lies.**  \n   - This means Shalonda's statement is false.\n\n2. **Jaymie says Shalonda tells the truth.**  \n   - If Jaymie is telling the truth, then Shalonda tells the truth, which contradicts the fact that Shalonda lies. Therefore, Jaymie must be lying.\n\n3. **Raymond says Jaymie lies.**  \n   - Since we have determined that Jaymie is lying, Raymond's statement is true.\n\n4. **Audrie says Raymond lies.**  \n   - Since Raymond is telling the truth, Audrie's statement is false, meaning Audrie is lying.\n\n5. **Sherrie says Audrie lies.**  \n   - Since Audrie is lying, Sherrie's statement is true.\n\nNow, let's summarize the truthfulness of each person:\n- Shalonda: Lies\n- Jaymie: Lies\n- Raymond: Tells the truth\n- Audrie: Lies\n- Sherrie: Tells the truth\n\nTherefore, Sherrie does tell the truth.\n\n<<<Sherrie tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Shalonda lies.
