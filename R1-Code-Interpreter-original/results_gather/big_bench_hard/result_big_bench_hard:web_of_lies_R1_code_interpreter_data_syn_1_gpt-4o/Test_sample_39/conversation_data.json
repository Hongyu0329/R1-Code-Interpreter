    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We have a chain of statements, and we need to analyze them logically.\n\n1. **Jamey lies.**  \n   - This is a given fact.\n\n2. **Vernell says Jamey tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Jamey lies, Vernell's statement is false. Therefore, Vernell lies.\n\n3. **Millicent says Vernell lies.**  \n   - Since Vernell lies, Millicent's statement is true. Therefore, Millicent tells the truth.\n\n4. **Rashida says Millicent tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Millicent tells the truth, Rashida's statement is true. Therefore, Rashida tells the truth.\n\n5. **Vina says Rashida tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Rashida tells the truth, Vina's statement is true. Therefore, Vina tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- Jamey lies.\n- Vernell lies.\n- Millicent tells the truth.\n- Rashida tells the truth.\n- Vina tells the truth.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Vina indeed tells the truth.\n\n<<<Vina tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Jamey lies.
