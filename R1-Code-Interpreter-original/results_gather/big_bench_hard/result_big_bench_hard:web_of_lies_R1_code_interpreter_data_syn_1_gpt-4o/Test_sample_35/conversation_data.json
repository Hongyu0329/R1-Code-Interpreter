    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Andree tells the truth.\n2. Audrie says Andree tells the truth.\n3. Jerry says Audrie lies.\n4. Helene says Jerry lies.\n5. Bernita says Helene tells the truth.\n\nLet's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Andree tells the truth, then Audrie's statement is true because Audrie says Andree tells the truth.\n- If Audrie's statement is true, then Jerry's statement must be false because Jerry says Audrie lies.\n- If Jerry's statement is false, then Helene's statement is true because Helene says Jerry lies.\n- If Helene's statement is true, then Bernita's statement is true because Bernita says Helene tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Andree is lying:\n\n- If Andree is lying, then Audrie's statement is false because Audrie says Andree tells the truth.\n- If Audrie's statement is false, then Jerry's statement is true because Jerry says Audrie lies.\n- If Jerry's statement is true, then Helene's statement is false because Helene says Jerry lies.\n- If Helene's statement is false, then Bernita's statement is false because Bernita says Helene tells the truth.\n\nIn both scenarios, Bernita's statement is consistent with the truthfulness of the other statements. Therefore, Bernita tells the truth.\n\nLet's confirm this logic with a simple Python script to check the consistency of these statements.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Andree tells the truth\n    andree_truth = True\n    audrie_truth = andree_truth\n    jerry_truth = not audrie_truth\n    helene_truth = not jerry_truth\n    bernita_truth = helene_truth\n\n    # Check if Bernita tells the truth\n    if bernita_truth:\n        return \"Bernita tells the truth.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Bernita does not tell the truth.\"\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the conclusion.",
    "The code execution confirms that Bernita tells the truth. The logical analysis and the code both support this conclusion. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Bernita tells the truth.>>>"
