    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We have a series of statements about who is lying and who is telling the truth. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Elanor lies.**\n2. **Tamika says Elanor lies.**\n3. **Ka says Tamika tells the truth.**\n4. **Shaunda says Ka lies.**\n5. **Conception says Shaunda lies.**\n\nWe need to determine if Conception is telling the truth. Let's analyze the statements:\n\n- If Elanor lies, then Tamika's statement \"Elanor lies\" is true.\n- If Tamika's statement is true, then Ka's statement \"Tamika tells the truth\" is also true.\n- If Ka's statement is true, then Shaunda's statement \"Ka lies\" is false.\n- If Shaunda's statement is false, then Conception's statement \"Shaunda lies\" is true.\n\nLet's verify this logic with a code to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Elanor lies\n    elanor_lies = True\n    \n    # Tamika says Elanor lies\n    tamika_truth = elanor_lies\n    \n    # Ka says Tamika tells the truth\n    ka_truth = tamika_truth\n    \n    # Shaunda says Ka lies\n    shaunda_truth = not ka_truth\n    \n    # Conception says Shaunda lies\n    conception_truth = not shaunda_truth\n    \n    return conception_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nThe code will determine if Conception is telling the truth based on the logical consistency of the statements. Let's execute the code to find out.",
    "The code output indicates that Conception is telling the truth. The logical analysis and the code confirm that the statements are consistent with Conception's statement being true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Conception tells the truth.>>>"
