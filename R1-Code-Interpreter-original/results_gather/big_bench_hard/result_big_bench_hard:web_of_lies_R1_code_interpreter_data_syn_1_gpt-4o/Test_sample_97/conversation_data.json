    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Jamey lies.**  \n   - This is a given fact.\n\n2. **Michaela says Jamey tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Jamey lies, Michaela's statement is false. Therefore, Michaela lies.\n\n3. **Millicent says Michaela lies.**  \n   - Since Michaela lies, Millicent's statement is true. Therefore, Millicent tells the truth.\n\n4. **Elanor says Millicent tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Millicent tells the truth, Elanor's statement is true. Therefore, Elanor tells the truth.\n\n5. **Rashida says Elanor lies.**  \n   - Since Elanor tells the truth, Rashida's statement is false. Therefore, Rashida lies.\n\nBased on this analysis, Rashida does not tell the truth. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Rashida does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Jamey lies.
