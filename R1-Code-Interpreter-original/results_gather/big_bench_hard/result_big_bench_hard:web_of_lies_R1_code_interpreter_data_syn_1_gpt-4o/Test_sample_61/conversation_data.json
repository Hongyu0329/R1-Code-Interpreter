    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical implications of their statements.\n\n1. **Maybelle tells the truth.**\n   - If Maybelle tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Bernita says Maybelle tells the truth.**\n   - If Bernita tells the truth, then Maybelle tells the truth.\n\n3. **Inga says Bernita tells the truth.**\n   - If Inga tells the truth, then Bernita tells the truth.\n\n4. **Tamika says Inga lies.**\n   - If Tamika tells the truth, then Inga lies.\n\n5. **Helene says Tamika tells the truth.**\n   - If Helene tells the truth, then Tamika tells the truth.\n\nLet's analyze the implications:\n\n- If Helene tells the truth, then Tamika tells the truth.\n- If Tamika tells the truth, then Inga lies.\n- If Inga lies, then Bernita does not tell the truth.\n- If Bernita does not tell the truth, then Maybelle does not tell the truth.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because if Maybelle does not tell the truth, then Bernita's statement is false, which means Inga's statement is false, which means Tamika's statement is true, which means Helene's statement is true. This is consistent, but it contradicts the initial assumption that Maybelle tells the truth.\n\nLet's consider the opposite:\n\n- If Helene does not tell the truth, then Tamika does not tell the truth.\n- If Tamika does not tell the truth, then Inga tells the truth.\n- If Inga tells the truth, then Bernita tells the truth.\n- If Bernita tells the truth, then Maybelle tells the truth.\n\nThis scenario is consistent and does not lead to any contradictions. Therefore, Helene does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Helene does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Maybelle tells the truth.
