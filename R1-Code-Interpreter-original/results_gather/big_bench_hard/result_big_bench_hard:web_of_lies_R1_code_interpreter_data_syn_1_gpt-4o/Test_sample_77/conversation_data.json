    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information.\n\n1. **Ryan tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. Let's assume Ryan is telling the truth.\n\n2. **Helene says Ryan tells the truth.**\n   - If Helene is telling the truth, then Ryan is indeed telling the truth, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\n3. **Kandi says Helene tells the truth.**\n   - If Kandi is telling the truth, then Helene is telling the truth, which means Ryan is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Inga says Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - If Inga is telling the truth, then Kandi is telling the truth, which means Helene is telling the truth, and thus Ryan is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Delbert says Inga lies.**\n   - If Delbert is telling the truth, then Inga is lying. If Inga is lying, then Kandi is lying, which means Helene is lying, and thus Ryan is lying. This contradicts our initial assumption that Ryan tells the truth.\n\nSince assuming Delbert tells the truth leads to a contradiction, Delbert must be lying. Therefore, Inga is telling the truth, which means Kandi is telling the truth, Helene is telling the truth, and Ryan is telling the truth.\n\nThus, Delbert does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Delbert does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Ryan tells the truth.
