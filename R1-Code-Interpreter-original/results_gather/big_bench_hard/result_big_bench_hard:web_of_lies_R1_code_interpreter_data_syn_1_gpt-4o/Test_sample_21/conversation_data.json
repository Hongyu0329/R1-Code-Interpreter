    "To determine if Alejandro tells the truth, we need to analyze the chain of statements and see if they are consistent.\n\n1. **Ryan tells the truth.**\n2. **Sal says Ryan tells the truth.** \n   - If Sal is telling the truth, then Ryan is indeed telling the truth.\n3. **Leda says Sal tells the truth.**\n   - If Leda is telling the truth, then Sal is telling the truth, which means Ryan is telling the truth.\n4. **Rashida says Leda tells the truth.**\n   - If Rashida is telling the truth, then Leda is telling the truth, which means Sal is telling the truth, and Ryan is telling the truth.\n5. **Alejandro says Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - If Alejandro is telling the truth, then Rashida is telling the truth, which means Leda is telling the truth, Sal is telling the truth, and Ryan is telling the truth.\n\nThe chain of statements is consistent if Ryan tells the truth. If Ryan tells the truth, then all subsequent statements are true, including Alejandro's statement. Therefore, Alejandro tells the truth.\n\nLet's verify this logic using a simple Python script to ensure consistency.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nryan_truth = True\n\n# Check the chain of truth\nsal_truth = ryan_truth\nleda_truth = sal_truth\nrashida_truth = leda_truth\nalejandro_truth = rashida_truth\n\n# Output the result\nprint(alejandro_truth)\n```\n\nThe code will check the consistency of the statements and determine if Alejandro tells the truth. Let's execute it.",
    "The code output indicates that Alejandro tells the truth. The chain of statements is consistent, and since Ryan tells the truth, all subsequent statements are also true, including Alejandro's statement.\n\n<<<Alejandro tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Ryan tells the truth.
