    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Phoebe tells the truth.**\n2. **Helene says Phoebe lies.**\n3. **Sima says Helene lies.**\n4. **Alejandro says Sima tells the truth.**\n5. **Michaela says Alejandro lies.**\n\nWe need to determine if Michaela tells the truth. Let's break it down:\n\n- If Phoebe tells the truth, then Helene's statement that Phoebe lies is false. Therefore, Helene lies.\n- If Helene lies, then Sima's statement that Helene lies is true. Therefore, Sima tells the truth.\n- If Sima tells the truth, then Alejandro's statement that Sima tells the truth is also true. Therefore, Alejandro tells the truth.\n- If Alejandro tells the truth, then Michaela's statement that Alejandro lies is false. Therefore, Michaela lies.\n\nLet's verify this logic using a Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nphoebe_truth = True\nhelene_truth = not phoebe_truth\nsima_truth = not helene_truth\nalejandro_truth = sima_truth\nmichaela_truth = not alejandro_truth\n\n# Output the result for Michaela\nprint(michaela_truth)\n```\n\nThe code will determine if Michaela tells the truth based on the logical deductions. Let's execute the code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Michaela does not tell the truth. This aligns with our logical deduction:\n\n- Phoebe tells the truth.\n- Helene lies (since she says Phoebe lies).\n- Sima tells the truth (since she says Helene lies).\n- Alejandro tells the truth (since he says Sima tells the truth).\n- Michaela lies (since she says Alejandro lies).\n\nTherefore, Michaela does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Michaela does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Phoebe tells the truth.
