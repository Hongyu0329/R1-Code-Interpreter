    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine if they are consistent. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Tamika tells the truth.\n2. Ka says Tamika tells the truth.\n3. Fidel says Ka tells the truth.\n4. Elanor says Fidel tells the truth.\n5. Amberly says Elanor tells the truth.\n\nWe need to determine if Amberly tells the truth. If Amberly tells the truth, then Elanor must also be telling the truth. If Elanor tells the truth, then Fidel must be telling the truth, and so on.\n\nLet's assume Amberly tells the truth and see if this assumption leads to a consistent set of truths:\n\n- If Amberly tells the truth, then Elanor tells the truth.\n- If Elanor tells the truth, then Fidel tells the truth.\n- If Fidel tells the truth, then Ka tells the truth.\n- If Ka tells the truth, then Tamika tells the truth.\n\nSince Tamika is the starting point and is assumed to tell the truth, this chain of reasoning is consistent. Therefore, Amberly telling the truth does not lead to any contradictions.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite scenario: if Amberly does not tell the truth, then Elanor does not tell the truth, which means Fidel does not tell the truth, and so on. This would imply that Tamika does not tell the truth, which contradicts the initial statement that Tamika tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Amberly tells the truth.\n\n<<<Amberly tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Tamika tells the truth.
