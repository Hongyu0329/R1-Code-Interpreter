    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Helene**: Helene tells the truth.\n2. **Lorine**: Lorine says Helene lies.\n3. **Raymond**: Raymond says Lorine tells the truth.\n4. **Ka**: Ka says Raymond tells the truth.\n5. **Christie**: Christie says Ka tells the truth.\n\nLet's analyze the chain of statements:\n\n- If Helene tells the truth, then Lorine's statement that Helene lies is false.\n- If Lorine's statement is false, then Raymond's statement that Lorine tells the truth is also false.\n- If Raymond's statement is false, then Ka's statement that Raymond tells the truth is false.\n- If Ka's statement is false, then Christie's statement that Ka tells the truth is false.\n\nThus, if Helene tells the truth, it leads to a contradiction because it makes Christie's statement false. Therefore, Helene must be lying.\n\nLet's analyze the chain of statements assuming Helene lies:\n\n- If Helene lies, then Lorine's statement that Helene lies is true.\n- If Lorine's statement is true, then Raymond's statement that Lorine tells the truth is true.\n- If Raymond's statement is true, then Ka's statement that Raymond tells the truth is true.\n- If Ka's statement is true, then Christie's statement that Ka tells the truth is true.\n\nThis chain of reasoning is consistent and does not lead to any contradictions. Therefore, if Helene lies, all subsequent statements are true, including Christie's statement.\n\nThus, Christie tells the truth.\n\n<<<Christie tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Helene tells the truth.
