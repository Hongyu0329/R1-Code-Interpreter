    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical consistency of their statements.\n\n1. **Phoebe tells the truth.**\n2. **Christie says Phoebe tells the truth.**\n3. **Fletcher says Christie tells the truth.**\n4. **Amberly says Fletcher lies.**\n5. **Raymond says Amberly tells the truth.**\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n- If Phoebe tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n- If Christie says Phoebe tells the truth, and Phoebe indeed tells the truth, then Christie is also telling the truth.\n- If Fletcher says Christie tells the truth, and Christie is telling the truth, then Fletcher is also telling the truth.\n- If Amberly says Fletcher lies, but Fletcher is telling the truth, then Amberly is lying.\n- If Raymond says Amberly tells the truth, but Amberly is lying, then Raymond is lying.\n\nNow, let's verify this logic using a Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_truth():\n    # Assume Phoebe tells the truth\n    phoebe_truth = True\n    \n    # Christie says Phoebe tells the truth\n    christie_truth = phoebe_truth\n    \n    # Fletcher says Christie tells the truth\n    fletcher_truth = christie_truth\n    \n    # Amberly says Fletcher lies\n    amberly_truth = not fletcher_truth\n    \n    # Raymond says Amberly tells the truth\n    raymond_truth = amberly_truth\n    \n    return raymond_truth\n\nprint(check_truth())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if Raymond tells the truth.",
    "The code output indicates that Raymond does not tell the truth. This aligns with our logical deduction:\n\n- Phoebe tells the truth.\n- Christie, who says Phoebe tells the truth, is also telling the truth.\n- Fletcher, who says Christie tells the truth, is telling the truth.\n- Amberly, who says Fletcher lies, is lying.\n- Raymond, who says Amberly tells the truth, is lying.\n\nTherefore, Raymond does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Raymond does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Phoebe tells the truth.
