    "To determine if Kandi tells the truth, we need to analyze the chain of statements and identify any contradictions or consistencies.\n\n1. **Teressa lies.** - This is the initial statement. We assume it to be true for now.\n2. **Willian says Teressa lies.** - If Teressa lies, then Willian is telling the truth.\n3. **Jamey says Willian lies.** - If Willian is telling the truth, then Jamey is lying.\n4. **Ryan says Jamey lies.** - If Jamey is lying, then Ryan is telling the truth.\n5. **Kandi says Ryan lies.** - If Ryan is telling the truth, then Kandi is lying.\n\nLet's verify this logic with a simple Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\n# Initial assumptions\nteressa_lies = True\n\n# Statements\nwillian_truth = teressa_lies  # Willian says Teressa lies\njamey_truth = not willian_truth  # Jamey says Willian lies\nryan_truth = not jamey_truth  # Ryan says Jamey lies\nkandi_truth = not ryan_truth  # Kandi says Ryan lies\n\n# Output whether Kandi tells the truth\nprint(kandi_truth)\n```\n\nThe code will determine if Kandi is telling the truth based on the logical chain of statements. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Kandi does not tell the truth. This conclusion is based on the logical chain of statements:\n\n1. Teressa lies.\n2. Willian tells the truth because he says Teressa lies.\n3. Jamey lies because he says Willian lies.\n4. Ryan tells the truth because he says Jamey lies.\n5. Kandi lies because she says Ryan lies.\n\nTherefore, Kandi does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Kandi does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Teressa lies.
