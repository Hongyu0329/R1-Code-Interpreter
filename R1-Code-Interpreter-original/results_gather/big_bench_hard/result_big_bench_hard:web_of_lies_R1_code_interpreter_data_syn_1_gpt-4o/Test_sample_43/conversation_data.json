    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Fletcher tells the truth.**\n2. **Helene says Fletcher lies.**\n3. **Elanor says Helene tells the truth.**\n4. **Yoland says Elanor tells the truth.**\n5. **Audrie says Yoland lies.**\n\nLet's start by assuming Fletcher tells the truth. If Fletcher tells the truth, then Helene's statement that Fletcher lies must be false. This means Helene is lying.\n\nIf Helene is lying, then Elanor's statement that Helene tells the truth must also be false. This means Elanor is lying.\n\nIf Elanor is lying, then Yoland's statement that Elanor tells the truth must also be false. This means Yoland is lying.\n\nIf Yoland is lying, then Audrie's statement that Yoland lies must be true. This means Audrie is telling the truth.\n\nNow, let's verify this by assuming Fletcher is lying and see if it leads to a contradiction:\n\n- If Fletcher is lying, then Helene's statement that Fletcher lies is true. This means Helene is telling the truth.\n- If Helene is telling the truth, then Elanor's statement that Helene tells the truth is also true. This means Elanor is telling the truth.\n- If Elanor is telling the truth, then Yoland's statement that Elanor tells the truth is also true. This means Yoland is telling the truth.\n- If Yoland is telling the truth, then Audrie's statement that Yoland lies is false. This means Audrie is lying.\n\nSince assuming Fletcher is lying leads to Audrie lying, which contradicts our initial assumption, the only consistent scenario is that Fletcher tells the truth, and therefore, Audrie tells the truth.\n\nThus, Audrie tells the truth.\n\n<<<Audrie tells the truth.>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Fletcher tells the truth.
