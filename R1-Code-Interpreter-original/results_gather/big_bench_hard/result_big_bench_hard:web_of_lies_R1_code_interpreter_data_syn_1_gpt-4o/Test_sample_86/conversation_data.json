    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We have a chain of statements, and we need to analyze them logically to find out if Teressa tells the truth.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. Jamey lies.\n2. Raymond says Jamey lies.\n3. Ka says Raymond lies.\n4. Bernita says Ka tells the truth.\n5. Teressa says Bernita lies.\n\nWe need to determine the truthfulness of each statement, starting from the last one, as it will help us backtrack and verify the others.\n\n- If Teressa tells the truth, then Bernita lies.\n- If Bernita lies, then Ka does not tell the truth.\n- If Ka does not tell the truth, then Raymond does not lie.\n- If Raymond does not lie, then Jamey lies.\n\nLet's verify this logic with a code to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Teressa tells the truth\n    teressa_truth = True\n    \n    # If Teressa tells the truth, Bernita lies\n    bernita_truth = not teressa_truth\n    \n    # If Bernita lies, Ka does not tell the truth\n    ka_truth = not bernita_truth\n    \n    # If Ka does not tell the truth, Raymond does not lie\n    raymond_truth = not ka_truth\n    \n    # If Raymond does not lie, Jamey lies\n    jamey_truth = not raymond_truth\n    \n    # Check if the assumptions are consistent\n    return teressa_truth and not bernita_truth and not ka_truth and raymond_truth and not jamey_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the consistency of the assumptions.",
    "The code output indicates that the assumption that Teressa tells the truth leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Teressa must be lying. Let's analyze the statements again with the assumption that Teressa lies:\n\n- If Teressa lies, then Bernita tells the truth.\n- If Bernita tells the truth, then Ka tells the truth.\n- If Ka tells the truth, then Raymond lies.\n- If Raymond lies, then Jamey does not lie.\n\nLet's verify this logic with a code to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Teressa lies\n    teressa_truth = False\n    \n    # If Teressa lies, Bernita tells the truth\n    bernita_truth = not teressa_truth\n    \n    # If Bernita tells the truth, Ka tells the truth\n    ka_truth = bernita_truth\n    \n    # If Ka tells the truth, Raymond lies\n    raymond_truth = not ka_truth\n    \n    # If Raymond lies, Jamey does not lie\n    jamey_truth = not raymond_truth\n    \n    # Check if the assumptions are consistent\n    return not teressa_truth and bernita_truth and ka_truth and not raymond_truth and jamey_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the consistency of the assumptions.",
    "The code output indicates that the assumption that Teressa lies leads to a consistent set of statements. Therefore, based on the logical analysis and verification, Teressa does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Teressa does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
