    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We will analyze the statements logically:\n\n1. **Millicent lies.**\n2. **Alexis says Millicent lies.**\n3. **Inga says Alexis tells the truth.**\n4. **Christie says Inga lies.**\n5. **Gwenn says Christie lies.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Millicent lies, then Alexis is telling the truth because Alexis says Millicent lies.\n- If Alexis tells the truth, then Inga is also telling the truth because Inga says Alexis tells the truth.\n- If Inga tells the truth, then Christie is lying because Christie says Inga lies.\n- If Christie is lying, then Gwenn is telling the truth because Gwenn says Christie lies.\n\nThus, the logical consistency of the statements leads us to conclude that Gwenn tells the truth.\n\nLet's verify this reasoning with a simple Python script to ensure the logic holds:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nmillicent_lies = True\nalexis_truth = millicent_lies\ninga_truth = alexis_truth\nchristie_lies = not inga_truth\ngwenn_truth = not christie_lies\n\n# Output the result\nprint(gwenn_truth)\n```\n\nThis code will check the logical consistency of the statements and determine if Gwenn tells the truth. Let's execute it to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Gwenn tells the truth, which aligns with our logical reasoning. Therefore, based on the analysis and the code execution, we can conclude that:\n\n<<<Gwenn tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Millicent lies.
