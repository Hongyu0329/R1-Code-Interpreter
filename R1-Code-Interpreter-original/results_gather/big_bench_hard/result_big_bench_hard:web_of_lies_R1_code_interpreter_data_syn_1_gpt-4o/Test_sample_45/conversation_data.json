    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n2. **Yoland says Sima lies.**\n3. **Amberly says Yoland tells the truth.**\n4. **Inga says Amberly lies.**\n5. **Alexis says Inga tells the truth.**\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n- If Sima tells the truth, then Yoland's statement that \"Sima lies\" is false.\n- If Yoland's statement is false, then Amberly's statement that \"Yoland tells the truth\" is also false.\n- If Amberly's statement is false, then Inga's statement that \"Amberly lies\" is true.\n- If Inga's statement is true, then Alexis's statement that \"Inga tells the truth\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, Alexis tells the truth.\n\nLet's verify this logic using a simple Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values for each person's statement\nsima_truth = True\nyoland_truth = not sima_truth\namberly_truth = yoland_truth\ninga_truth = not amberly_truth\nalexis_truth = inga_truth\n\n# Print the result for Alexis\nprint(alexis_truth)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Alexis tells the truth, which aligns with our logical reasoning. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Alexis tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Sima tells the truth.
