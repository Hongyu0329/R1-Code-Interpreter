    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. **Ka tells the truth.**\n2. **Fletcher says Ka tells the truth.**\n3. **Maybelle says Fletcher lies.**\n4. **Lorine says Maybelle lies.**\n5. **Crista says Lorine tells the truth.**\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- If Ka tells the truth, then Fletcher's statement is also true because Fletcher says Ka tells the truth.\n- If Fletcher tells the truth, then Maybelle's statement is false because Maybelle says Fletcher lies.\n- If Maybelle's statement is false, then Lorine's statement is true because Lorine says Maybelle lies.\n- If Lorine's statement is true, then Crista's statement is also true because Crista says Lorine tells the truth.\n\nThis logical chain suggests that all statements are consistent if we assume Ka tells the truth. Therefore, Crista tells the truth.\n\nLet's verify this logic with a simple Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Ka tells the truth\n    ka_truth = True\n    \n    # Fletcher says Ka tells the truth\n    fletcher_truth = ka_truth\n    \n    # Maybelle says Fletcher lies\n    maybelle_truth = not fletcher_truth\n    \n    # Lorine says Maybelle lies\n    lorine_truth = not maybelle_truth\n    \n    # Crista says Lorine tells the truth\n    crista_truth = lorine_truth\n    \n    return crista_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Crista tells the truth, which aligns with our logical analysis. Therefore, based on the logical consistency of the statements, Crista indeed tells the truth.\n\n<<<Crista tells the truth.>>>"
