    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical implications of their statements.\n\n1. **Audrie lies.**\n   - This is a given statement.\n\n2. **Jaymie says Audrie tells the truth.**\n   - If Jaymie is telling the truth, then Audrie tells the truth, which contradicts the given statement that Audrie lies. Therefore, Jaymie must be lying.\n\n3. **Phoebe says Jaymie lies.**\n   - Since we have determined that Jaymie is lying, Phoebe must be telling the truth.\n\n4. **Conception says Phoebe tells the truth.**\n   - Since Phoebe is telling the truth, Conception is also telling the truth.\n\n5. **Michael says Conception lies.**\n   - Since Conception is telling the truth, Michael must be lying.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- Audrie lies.\n- Jaymie lies.\n- Phoebe tells the truth.\n- Conception tells the truth.\n- Michael lies.\n\nTherefore, Michael does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<No, Michael does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Audrie lies.
