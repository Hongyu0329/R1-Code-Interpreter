    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Millie tells the truth.**\n   - This is our starting point. If Millie tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Millicent says Millie lies.**\n   - If Millie tells the truth, then Millicent's statement must be false because she claims Millie lies.\n\n3. **Phoebe says Millicent tells the truth.**\n   - Since Millicent's statement is false, Phoebe's statement must also be false because she claims Millicent tells the truth.\n\n4. **Sherrie says Phoebe lies.**\n   - Since Phoebe's statement is false, Sherrie's statement is true because she correctly claims that Phoebe lies.\n\n5. **Raymond says Sherrie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sherrie's statement is true, Raymond's statement is also true because he correctly claims that Sherrie tells the truth.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Raymond tells the truth. \n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to ensure the logic holds:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nmillie_truth = True\nmillicent_truth = not millie_truth\nphoebe_truth = millicent_truth\nsherrie_truth = not phoebe_truth\nraymond_truth = sherrie_truth\n\n# Output the result\nprint(raymond_truth)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether Raymond tells the truth by evaluating the logical statements. Let's execute it.",
    "The code output confirms that Raymond tells the truth. Based on the logical deductions and the code verification, we can conclude that Raymond indeed tells the truth.\n\n<<<Raymond tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Millie tells the truth.
