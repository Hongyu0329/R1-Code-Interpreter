    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the logical implications of their statements.\n\n1. **Vernell tells the truth.**\n2. **Kandi says Vernell tells the truth.**  \n   - If Kandi is telling the truth, then Vernell is telling the truth.\n3. **Alexis says Kandi tells the truth.**  \n   - If Alexis is telling the truth, then Kandi is telling the truth.\n4. **Sima says Alexis lies.**  \n   - If Sima is telling the truth, then Alexis is lying.\n5. **Phoebe says Sima tells the truth.**  \n   - If Phoebe is telling the truth, then Sima is telling the truth.\n\nLet's analyze the implications:\n\n- If Vernell tells the truth, then Kandi's statement is true.\n- If Kandi's statement is true, then Alexis's statement is true.\n- If Alexis's statement is true, then Sima's statement is false (since Alexis says Kandi tells the truth, and Sima says Alexis lies).\n- If Sima's statement is false, then Phoebe's statement is false (since Phoebe says Sima tells the truth).\n\nNow, let's check the consistency of the statements:\n\n- If Vernell tells the truth, then Kandi, Alexis, and Phoebe must be telling the truth, but Sima must be lying.\n- If Sima is lying, then Phoebe is lying.\n\nThis means Phoebe cannot be telling the truth if Vernell is telling the truth. Let's verify this logic using a Python script to ensure consistency.\n\n```python\ndef check_truth():\n    # Assume Vernell tells the truth\n    vernell_truth = True\n    \n    # Kandi says Vernell tells the truth\n    kandi_truth = vernell_truth\n    \n    # Alexis says Kandi tells the truth\n    alexis_truth = kandi_truth\n    \n    # Sima says Alexis lies\n    sima_truth = not alexis_truth\n    \n    # Phoebe says Sima tells the truth\n    phoebe_truth = sima_truth\n    \n    return phoebe_truth\n\nprint(check_truth())\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Phoebe does not tell the truth. This aligns with our logical analysis. Since the code execution confirms our reasoning, we can conclude that Phoebe is lying.\n\n<<<Phoebe does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Vernell tells the truth.
