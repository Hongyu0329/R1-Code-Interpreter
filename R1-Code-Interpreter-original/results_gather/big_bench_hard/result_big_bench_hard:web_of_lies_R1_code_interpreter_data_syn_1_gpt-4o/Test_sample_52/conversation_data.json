    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Andree lies.\n2. Amberly says Andree tells the truth.\n3. Gwenn says Amberly tells the truth.\n4. Willian says Gwenn lies.\n5. Alexis says Willian tells the truth.\n\nWe need to determine if Alexis tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Andree lies, then Amberly's statement that Andree tells the truth is false. Therefore, Amberly lies.\n- If Amberly lies, then Gwenn's statement that Amberly tells the truth is false. Therefore, Gwenn lies.\n- If Gwenn lies, then Willian's statement that Gwenn lies is true. Therefore, Willian tells the truth.\n- If Willian tells the truth, then Alexis's statement that Willian tells the truth is true.\n\nThus, Alexis tells the truth. Let's confirm this logic with a simple Python script to ensure consistency in our reasoning.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values for each person\nandree_truth = False  # Andree lies\namberly_truth = andree_truth  # Amberly says Andree tells the truth\ngwenn_truth = amberly_truth  # Gwenn says Amberly tells the truth\nwillian_truth = not gwenn_truth  # Willian says Gwenn lies\nalexis_truth = willian_truth  # Alexis says Willian tells the truth\n\n# Output whether Alexis tells the truth\nprint(alexis_truth)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Alexis tells the truth, which aligns with our logical reasoning. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Alexis tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Andree lies.
