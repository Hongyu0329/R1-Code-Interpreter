    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Shalonda tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement, so we assume Shalonda is truthful.\n\n2. **Alexis says Shalonda tells the truth.**\n   - Since Shalonda tells the truth, Alexis is also telling the truth.\n\n3. **Christie says Alexis lies.**\n   - Since Alexis tells the truth, Christie's statement is false. Therefore, Christie is lying.\n\n4. **Inga says Christie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Christie is lying, Inga's statement is false. Therefore, Inga is lying.\n\n5. **Crista says Inga tells the truth.**\n   - Since Inga is lying, Crista's statement is false. Therefore, Crista is lying.\n\nNow, let's summarize the truthfulness of each person:\n- Shalonda: Truthful\n- Alexis: Truthful\n- Christie: Lying\n- Inga: Lying\n- Crista: Lying\n\nThe question asks if Crista tells the truth. Based on our analysis, Crista is lying.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Crista does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Shalonda tells the truth.
