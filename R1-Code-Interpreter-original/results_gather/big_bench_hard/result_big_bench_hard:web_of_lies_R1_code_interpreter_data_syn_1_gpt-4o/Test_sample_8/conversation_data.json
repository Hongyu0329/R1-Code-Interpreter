    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Fletcher tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement, so we assume Fletcher is truthful.\n\n2. **Conception says Fletcher tells the truth.**\n   - Since Fletcher is truthful, Conception's statement is also true, which means Conception is truthful.\n\n3. **Bernita says Conception tells the truth.**\n   - Since Conception is truthful, Bernita's statement is true, which means Bernita is truthful.\n\n4. **Jamey says Bernita tells the truth.**\n   - Since Bernita is truthful, Jamey's statement is true, which means Jamey is truthful.\n\n5. **Teressa says Jamey lies.**\n   - Since Jamey is truthful, Teressa's statement is false, which means Teressa is lying.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Teressa does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Teressa does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Fletcher tells the truth.
