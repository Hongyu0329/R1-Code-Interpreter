    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Willian says something, but we know \"Willian lies.\"\n2. Inga says, \"Willian tells the truth.\"\n3. Fidel says, \"Inga lies.\"\n4. Gwenn says, \"Fidel tells the truth.\"\n5. Crista says, \"Gwenn tells the truth.\"\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- Since Willian lies, Inga's statement \"Willian tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Inga lies.\n- Since Inga lies, Fidel's statement \"Inga lies\" is true. Therefore, Fidel tells the truth.\n- Since Fidel tells the truth, Gwenn's statement \"Fidel tells the truth\" is true. Therefore, Gwenn tells the truth.\n- Since Gwenn tells the truth, Crista's statement \"Gwenn tells the truth\" is true. Therefore, Crista tells the truth.\n\nThus, Crista does tell the truth.\n\n<<<Crista tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Willian lies.
