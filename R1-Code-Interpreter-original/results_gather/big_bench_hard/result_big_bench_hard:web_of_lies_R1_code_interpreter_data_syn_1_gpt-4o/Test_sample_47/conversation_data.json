    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We will analyze the statements logically:\n\n1. **Michaela lies.**\n2. **Millicent says Michaela lies.**\n3. **Delbert says Millicent lies.**\n4. **Bernita says Delbert lies.**\n5. **Teressa says Bernita tells the truth.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Michaela lies, then Millicent's statement that \"Michaela lies\" is true.\n- If Millicent's statement is true, then Delbert's statement that \"Millicent lies\" is false.\n- If Delbert's statement is false, then Bernita's statement that \"Delbert lies\" is true.\n- If Bernita's statement is true, then Teressa's statement that \"Bernita tells the truth\" is true.\n\nThus, if Michaela lies, then Teressa tells the truth. \n\nNow, let's check the consistency of this logic by assuming the opposite:\n\n- If Michaela tells the truth, then Millicent's statement that \"Michaela lies\" is false.\n- If Millicent's statement is false, then Delbert's statement that \"Millicent lies\" is true.\n- If Delbert's statement is true, then Bernita's statement that \"Delbert lies\" is false.\n- If Bernita's statement is false, then Teressa's statement that \"Bernita tells the truth\" is false.\n\nThis means that if Michaela tells the truth, Teressa does not tell the truth. \n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Michaela lies, and consequently, Teressa tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer Teressa tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Michaela lies.
