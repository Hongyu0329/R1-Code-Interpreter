    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Rashida lies.\n2. Ryan says Rashida tells the truth.\n3. Vernell says Ryan tells the truth.\n4. Shaunda says Vernell lies.\n5. Amberly says Shaunda lies.\n\nWe need to determine if Amberly tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Rashida lies, so her statement is false.\n- Ryan says Rashida tells the truth, but since Rashida lies, Ryan's statement is false.\n- Vernell says Ryan tells the truth, but since Ryan's statement is false, Vernell's statement is also false.\n- Shaunda says Vernell lies, and since Vernell's statement is false, Shaunda's statement is true.\n- Amberly says Shaunda lies, but since Shaunda's statement is true, Amberly's statement is false.\n\nTherefore, Amberly does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Amberly does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Rashida lies.
