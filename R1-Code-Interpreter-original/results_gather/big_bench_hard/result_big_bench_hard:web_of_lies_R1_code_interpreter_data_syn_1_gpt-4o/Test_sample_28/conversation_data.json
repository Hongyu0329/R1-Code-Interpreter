    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Ryan lies.\n2. Kristian says Ryan lies.\n3. Teressa says Kristian tells the truth.\n4. Amberly says Teressa tells the truth.\n5. Jamey says Amberly tells the truth.\n\nWe need to determine if Jamey tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Ryan lies, then Kristian's statement \"Ryan lies\" is true.\n- If Kristian tells the truth, then Teressa's statement \"Kristian tells the truth\" is true.\n- If Teressa tells the truth, then Amberly's statement \"Teressa tells the truth\" is true.\n- If Amberly tells the truth, then Jamey's statement \"Amberly tells the truth\" is true.\n\nThis creates a chain of truthfulness. If Ryan lies, then all subsequent statements are true, including Jamey's statement. Therefore, Jamey tells the truth.\n\nLet's confirm this logic with a simple Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Ryan lies\n    ryan_lies = True\n    \n    # Kristian says Ryan lies\n    kristian_truth = ryan_lies\n    \n    # Teressa says Kristian tells the truth\n    teressa_truth = kristian_truth\n    \n    # Amberly says Teressa tells the truth\n    amberly_truth = teressa_truth\n    \n    # Jamey says Amberly tells the truth\n    jamey_truth = amberly_truth\n    \n    return jamey_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the conclusion.",
    "The code output indicates that Jamey tells the truth. This is consistent with our logical analysis. Since the chain of statements leads to the conclusion that Jamey is truthful, we can confidently say:\n\n<<<Jamey tells the truth.>>>"
