    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Crista lies.\n2. Michael says Crista tells the truth.\n3. Audrie says Michael lies.\n4. Sherrie says Audrie lies.\n5. Michaela says Sherrie tells the truth.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n- Since Crista lies, Michael's statement that Crista tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Michael lies.\n- Audrie says Michael lies, which is true because we have established that Michael lies.\n- Sherrie says Audrie lies. Since Audrie's statement is true, Sherrie's statement must be false. Therefore, Sherrie lies.\n- Michaela says Sherrie tells the truth. Since Sherrie lies, Michaela's statement is false.\n\nThus, Michaela does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Michaela does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Crista lies.
