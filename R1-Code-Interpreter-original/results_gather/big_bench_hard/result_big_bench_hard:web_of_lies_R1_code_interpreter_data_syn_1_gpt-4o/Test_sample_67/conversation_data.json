    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Vernell lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Vernell always lies.\n\n2. **Gwenn says Vernell lies.**\n   - If Gwenn is telling the truth, then Vernell indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. Therefore, Gwenn tells the truth.\n\n3. **Teressa says Gwenn lies.**\n   - Since we determined that Gwenn tells the truth, Teressa's statement that Gwenn lies must be false. Therefore, Teressa lies.\n\n4. **Bernita says Teressa tells the truth.**\n   - Since Teressa lies, Bernita's statement that Teressa tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Bernita lies.\n\n5. **Christie says Bernita lies.**\n   - Since Bernita lies, Christie's statement that Bernita lies is true. Therefore, Christie tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- Vernell lies.\n- Gwenn tells the truth.\n- Teressa lies.\n- Bernita lies.\n- Christie tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, Christie does tell the truth.\n\n<<<Christie tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Vernell lies.
