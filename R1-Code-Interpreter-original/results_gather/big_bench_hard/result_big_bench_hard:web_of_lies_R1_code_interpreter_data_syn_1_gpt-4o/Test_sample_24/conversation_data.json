    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Delfina tells the truth.**\n2. **Fletcher says Delfina lies.**\n3. **Amberly says Fletcher lies.**\n4. **Audrie says Amberly tells the truth.**\n5. **Lorine says Audrie tells the truth.**\n\nLet's start by assuming Delfina tells the truth. If Delfina tells the truth, then Fletcher's statement that Delfina lies must be false. If Fletcher lies, then Amberly's statement that Fletcher lies is true. If Amberly tells the truth, then Audrie's statement that Amberly tells the truth is also true. If Audrie tells the truth, then Lorine's statement that Audrie tells the truth is true.\n\nNow, let's assume Delfina lies. If Delfina lies, then Fletcher's statement that Delfina lies is true. If Fletcher tells the truth, then Amberly's statement that Fletcher lies is false. If Amberly lies, then Audrie's statement that Amberly tells the truth is false. If Audrie lies, then Lorine's statement that Audrie tells the truth is false.\n\nIn both scenarios, Lorine's statement is consistent with the assumption that Delfina tells the truth. Therefore, Lorine tells the truth.\n\nLet's verify this logic using a simple Python script to check the consistency of these statements.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Delfina tells the truth\n    delfina_truth = True\n    fletcher_truth = not delfina_truth  # Fletcher says Delfina lies\n    amberly_truth = not fletcher_truth  # Amberly says Fletcher lies\n    audrie_truth = amberly_truth  # Audrie says Amberly tells the truth\n    lorine_truth = audrie_truth  # Lorine says Audrie tells the truth\n\n    # Check if Lorine tells the truth\n    return lorine_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nThe code will check the consistency of the statements based on the assumption that Delfina tells the truth. Let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Lorine tells the truth when we assume Delfina tells the truth. This confirms our logical reasoning that Lorine's statement is consistent with the assumption that Delfina tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Lorine tells the truth.>>>"
