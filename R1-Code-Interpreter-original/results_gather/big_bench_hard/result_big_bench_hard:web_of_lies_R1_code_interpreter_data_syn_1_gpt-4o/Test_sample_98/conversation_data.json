    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Millicent tells the truth.**\n2. **Alexis says Millicent lies.**\n3. **Jaymie says Alexis lies.**\n4. **Willian says Jaymie tells the truth.**\n5. **Leda says Willian lies.**\n\nWe need to determine if Leda tells the truth. Let's break down the logic:\n\n- If Millicent tells the truth, then Alexis is lying.\n- If Alexis is lying, then Millicent is telling the truth.\n- If Jaymie says Alexis lies, and Alexis is indeed lying, then Jaymie is telling the truth.\n- If Willian says Jaymie tells the truth, and Jaymie is indeed telling the truth, then Willian is telling the truth.\n- If Leda says Willian lies, but Willian is telling the truth, then Leda is lying.\n\nLet's verify this logic using a Python script to check the consistency of these statements:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Millicent tells the truth\n    millicent_truth = True\n    \n    # Alexis says Millicent lies\n    alexis_truth = not millicent_truth\n    \n    # Jaymie says Alexis lies\n    jaymie_truth = not alexis_truth\n    \n    # Willian says Jaymie tells the truth\n    willian_truth = jaymie_truth\n    \n    # Leda says Willian lies\n    leda_truth = not willian_truth\n    \n    return leda_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if Leda tells the truth.",
    "The code output indicates that Leda does not tell the truth. This aligns with our logical deduction:\n\n- Millicent tells the truth.\n- Therefore, Alexis lies.\n- Jaymie, who says Alexis lies, is telling the truth.\n- Willian, who says Jaymie tells the truth, is also telling the truth.\n- Leda, who says Willian lies, is lying.\n\nThus, Leda does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Leda does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
