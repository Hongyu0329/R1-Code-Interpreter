    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n   - This is our starting point. If Sima tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Teressa says Sima tells the truth.**\n   - If Teressa is telling the truth, then Sima indeed tells the truth. This is consistent with our starting point.\n\n3. **Vina says Teressa lies.**\n   - If Vina is telling the truth, then Teressa is lying, which contradicts our assumption that Teressa is telling the truth. Therefore, Vina must be lying.\n\n4. **Crista says Vina lies.**\n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Vina is indeed lying, which is consistent with our conclusion that Vina is lying.\n\n5. **Phoebe says Crista tells the truth.**\n   - If Phoebe is telling the truth, then Crista is telling the truth, which is consistent with our conclusion that Crista is telling the truth.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n- Sima tells the truth.\n- Teressa tells the truth.\n- Vina lies.\n- Crista tells the truth.\n- Phoebe tells the truth.\n\nSince Phoebe's statement that Crista tells the truth is consistent with our analysis, Phoebe is indeed telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Phoebe tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Sima tells the truth.
