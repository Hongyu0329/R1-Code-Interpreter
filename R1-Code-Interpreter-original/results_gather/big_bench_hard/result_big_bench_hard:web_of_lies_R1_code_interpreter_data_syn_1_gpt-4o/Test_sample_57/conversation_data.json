    "To determine if Shalonda tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements and the relationships between them. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Jerry lies.\n2. Helene says Jerry lies.\n3. Kandi says Helene tells the truth.\n4. Jaymie says Kandi lies.\n5. Shalonda says Jaymie lies.\n\nWe need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze step by step:\n\n- If Jerry lies, then Helene's statement \"Jerry lies\" is true. Therefore, Helene tells the truth.\n- If Helene tells the truth, then Kandi's statement \"Helene tells the truth\" is also true. Therefore, Kandi tells the truth.\n- If Kandi tells the truth, then Jaymie's statement \"Kandi lies\" is false. Therefore, Jaymie lies.\n- If Jaymie lies, then Shalonda's statement \"Jaymie lies\" is true. Therefore, Shalonda tells the truth.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Shalonda tells the truth. \n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to verify the logical consistency of these statements.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values of each person's statement\njerry_lies = True\nhelene_truth = jerry_lies  # Helene says Jerry lies\nkandi_truth = helene_truth  # Kandi says Helene tells the truth\njaymie_lies = not kandi_truth  # Jaymie says Kandi lies\nshalonda_truth = not jaymie_lies  # Shalonda says Jaymie lies\n\n# Print the result for Shalonda\nprint(shalonda_truth)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether Shalonda tells the truth based on the logical deductions. Let's execute it.",
    "The code output indicates that Shalonda tells the truth. This confirms our logical deduction that Shalonda's statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Shalonda tells the truth.>>>"
