    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Jaymie tells the truth.\n2. Millicent says Jaymie lies.\n3. Millie says Millicent tells the truth.\n4. Vina says Millie lies.\n5. Leda says Vina tells the truth.\n\nWe need to determine if Leda tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Jaymie tells the truth, then Millicent's statement that Jaymie lies is false. Therefore, Millicent is lying.\n- If Millicent is lying, then Millie's statement that Millicent tells the truth is also false. Therefore, Millie is lying.\n- If Millie is lying, then Vina's statement that Millie lies is true. Therefore, Vina is telling the truth.\n- If Vina is telling the truth, then Leda's statement that Vina tells the truth is also true.\n\nThus, Leda tells the truth. \n\nLet's summarize this reasoning in a final answer.\n\n<<<Leda tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Jaymie tells the truth.
