    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency.\n\n1. **Sima lies.**\n   - This is a given statement.\n\n2. **Millie says Sima tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sima lies, Millie's statement is false. Therefore, Millie lies.\n\n3. **Jerry says Millie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Millie lies, Jerry's statement is false. Therefore, Jerry lies.\n\n4. **Vina says Jerry lies.**\n   - Since Jerry lies, Vina's statement is true. Therefore, Vina tells the truth.\n\n5. **Maybelle says Vina tells the truth.**\n   - Since Vina tells the truth, Maybelle's statement is true. Therefore, Maybelle tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- Sima lies.\n- Millie lies.\n- Jerry lies.\n- Vina tells the truth.\n- Maybelle tells the truth.\n\nThe question asks if Maybelle tells the truth. Based on our analysis, Maybelle does tell the truth.\n\n<<<Maybelle tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Sima lies.
