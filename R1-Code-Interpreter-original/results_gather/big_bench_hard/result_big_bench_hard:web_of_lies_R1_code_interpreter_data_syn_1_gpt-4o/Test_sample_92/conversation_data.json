    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the chain of truth-telling statements. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Jim tells the truth.**  \n   - This is our base statement. We assume Jim is telling the truth.\n\n2. **Tamika says Jim tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Jim tells the truth, Tamika is also telling the truth.\n\n3. **Helene says Tamika tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Tamika tells the truth, Helene is also telling the truth.\n\n4. **Jaymie says Helene tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Helene tells the truth, Jaymie is also telling the truth.\n\n5. **Conception says Jaymie tells the truth.**  \n   - Since Jaymie tells the truth, Conception is also telling the truth.\n\nSince each statement in the chain is dependent on the previous one, and we started with the assumption that Jim tells the truth, all subsequent statements are true. Therefore, Conception is telling the truth.\n\n<<<Conception tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Jim tells the truth.
