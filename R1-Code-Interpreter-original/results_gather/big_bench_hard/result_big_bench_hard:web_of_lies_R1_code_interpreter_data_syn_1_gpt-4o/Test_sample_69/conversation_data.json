    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Phoebe tells the truth.**\n2. **Jamey says Phoebe lies.**\n3. **Audrie says Jamey tells the truth.**\n4. **Michaela says Audrie lies.**\n5. **Vina says Michaela lies.**\n\nWe need to determine if Vina tells the truth. Let's break it down:\n\n- If Phoebe tells the truth, then Jamey's statement that Phoebe lies is false. Therefore, Jamey is lying.\n- If Jamey is lying, then Audrie's statement that Jamey tells the truth is false. Therefore, Audrie is lying.\n- If Audrie is lying, then Michaela's statement that Audrie lies is true. Therefore, Michaela is telling the truth.\n- If Michaela is telling the truth, then Vina's statement that Michaela lies is false. Therefore, Vina is lying.\n\nLet's verify this logic using a simple Python script to check the consistency of these statements.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Phoebe tells the truth\n    phoebe_truth = True\n    \n    # Jamey says Phoebe lies\n    jamey_truth = not phoebe_truth\n    \n    # Audrie says Jamey tells the truth\n    audrie_truth = jamey_truth\n    \n    # Michaela says Audrie lies\n    michaela_truth = not audrie_truth\n    \n    # Vina says Michaela lies\n    vina_truth = not michaela_truth\n    \n    return vina_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if Vina tells the truth.",
    "The code output indicates that Vina does not tell the truth. This aligns with our logical deduction:\n\n- Phoebe tells the truth.\n- Jamey lies about Phoebe.\n- Audrie lies about Jamey.\n- Michaela tells the truth about Audrie.\n- Vina lies about Michaela.\n\nTherefore, Vina does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Vina does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Phoebe tells the truth.
