    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Leda tells the truth.\n2. Alexis says Leda lies.\n3. Sal says Alexis lies.\n4. Phoebe says Sal tells the truth.\n5. Gwenn says Phoebe tells the truth.\n\nWe need to determine if Gwenn tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Leda tells the truth, then Alexis's statement that Leda lies is false. Therefore, Alexis lies.\n- If Alexis lies, then Sal's statement that Alexis lies is true. Therefore, Sal tells the truth.\n- If Sal tells the truth, then Phoebe's statement that Sal tells the truth is true. Therefore, Phoebe tells the truth.\n- If Phoebe tells the truth, then Gwenn's statement that Phoebe tells the truth is true. Therefore, Gwenn tells the truth.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Gwenn tells the truth. \n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to ensure the logic holds:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nleda_truth = True\nalexis_truth = not leda_truth\nsal_truth = not alexis_truth\nphoebe_truth = sal_truth\ngwenn_truth = phoebe_truth\n\n# Print the result for Gwenn\nprint(gwenn_truth)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether Gwenn tells the truth based on the logical deductions. Let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms that Gwenn tells the truth. The logical deductions we made are consistent with the output of the code. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Gwenn tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Leda tells the truth.
