    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n2. **Jim says Sima lies.**\n3. **Gwenn says Jim tells the truth.**\n4. **Phoebe says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n5. **Rashida says Phoebe lies.**\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- If Sima tells the truth, then Jim's statement that \"Sima lies\" must be false. Therefore, Jim is lying.\n- If Jim is lying, then Gwenn's statement that \"Jim tells the truth\" must also be false. Therefore, Gwenn is lying.\n- If Gwenn is lying, then Phoebe's statement that \"Gwenn tells the truth\" must be false. Therefore, Phoebe is lying.\n- If Phoebe is lying, then Rashida's statement that \"Phoebe lies\" must be true. Therefore, Rashida is telling the truth.\n\nThis logical deduction shows that Rashida is indeed telling the truth. \n\nLet's summarize the findings:\n\n- Sima tells the truth.\n- Jim lies.\n- Gwenn lies.\n- Phoebe lies.\n- Rashida tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, Rashida's statement is consistent with the logical deductions.\n\n<<<Rashida tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Sima tells the truth.
