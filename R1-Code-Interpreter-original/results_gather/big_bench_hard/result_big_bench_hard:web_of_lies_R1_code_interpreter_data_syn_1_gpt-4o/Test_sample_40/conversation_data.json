    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Alejandro lies.**\n   - This means Alejandro's statement is false.\n\n2. **Amberly says Alejandro tells the truth.**\n   - If Amberly is telling the truth, then Alejandro tells the truth, which contradicts the fact that Alejandro lies. Therefore, Amberly must be lying.\n\n3. **Osvaldo says Amberly lies.**\n   - Since Amberly is indeed lying, Osvaldo is telling the truth.\n\n4. **Vernell says Osvaldo lies.**\n   - Since Osvaldo is telling the truth, Vernell must be lying.\n\n5. **Shenna says Vernell lies.**\n   - Since Vernell is lying, Shenna is telling the truth.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- Alejandro lies.\n- Amberly lies.\n- Osvaldo tells the truth.\n- Vernell lies.\n- Shenna tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, Shenna does tell the truth.\n\n<<<Shenna tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Alejandro lies.
