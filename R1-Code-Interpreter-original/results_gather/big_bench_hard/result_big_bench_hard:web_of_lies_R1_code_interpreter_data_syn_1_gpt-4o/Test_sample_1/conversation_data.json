    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement based on the given information. Let's break down the statements and analyze them:\n\n1. **Kristian lies.**\n2. **Sherrie says Kristian lies.**\n3. **Delbert says Sherrie lies.**\n4. **Jerry says Delbert tells the truth.**\n5. **Shalonda says Jerry tells the truth.**\n\nWe need to determine if Shalonda tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Kristian lies, then Sherrie's statement \"Kristian lies\" is true.\n- If Sherrie's statement is true, then Delbert's statement \"Sherrie lies\" is false.\n- If Delbert's statement is false, then Jerry's statement \"Delbert tells the truth\" is false.\n- If Jerry's statement is false, then Shalonda's statement \"Jerry tells the truth\" is false.\n\nThus, if Kristian lies, Shalonda's statement is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite scenario:\n\n- If Kristian tells the truth, then Sherrie's statement \"Kristian lies\" is false.\n- If Sherrie's statement is false, then Delbert's statement \"Sherrie lies\" is true.\n- If Delbert's statement is true, then Jerry's statement \"Delbert tells the truth\" is true.\n- If Jerry's statement is true, then Shalonda's statement \"Jerry tells the truth\" is true.\n\nThus, if Kristian tells the truth, Shalonda's statement is true.\n\nSince we have a contradiction in the scenarios, we need to determine which scenario is consistent. The only consistent scenario is when Kristian tells the truth, leading to Shalonda also telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, Shalonda tells the truth.\n\n<<<Shalonda tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Kristian lies.
