    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency.\n\n1. **Delfina tells the truth.**\n2. **Willian says Delfina tells the truth.**\n   - If Willian is telling the truth, then Delfina is telling the truth.\n3. **Crista says Willian lies.**\n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Willian is lying, which means Delfina is not telling the truth.\n4. **Shalonda says Crista lies.**\n   - If Shalonda is telling the truth, then Crista is lying, which means Willian is telling the truth, and therefore Delfina is telling the truth.\n5. **Shenna says Shalonda tells the truth.**\n   - If Shenna is telling the truth, then Shalonda is telling the truth, which means Crista is lying, Willian is telling the truth, and Delfina is telling the truth.\n\nLet's analyze the logical consistency:\n\n- If Delfina tells the truth, then Willian is also telling the truth.\n- If Willian is telling the truth, Crista must be lying.\n- If Crista is lying, then Shalonda is telling the truth.\n- If Shalonda is telling the truth, then Shenna is also telling the truth.\n\nThis chain of reasoning is consistent. Therefore, Shenna is telling the truth.\n\n<<<Shenna tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Delfina tells the truth.
