    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Jerry lies.** - This is a given fact.\n\n2. **Millicent says Jerry tells the truth.** - Since Jerry lies, Millicent's statement is false. Therefore, Millicent lies.\n\n3. **Sal says Millicent tells the truth.** - Since Millicent lies, Sal's statement is false. Therefore, Sal lies.\n\n4. **Amberly says Sal tells the truth.** - Since Sal lies, Amberly's statement is false. Therefore, Amberly lies.\n\n5. **Shenna says Amberly lies.** - Since Amberly lies, Shenna's statement is true. Therefore, Shenna tells the truth.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, Shenna tells the truth. \n\nNow, let's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to ensure the logic holds:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\njerry_truth = False  # Jerry lies\nmillicent_truth = jerry_truth  # Millicent says Jerry tells the truth\nsal_truth = millicent_truth  # Sal says Millicent tells the truth\namberly_truth = sal_truth  # Amberly says Sal tells the truth\nshenna_truth = not amberly_truth  # Shenna says Amberly lies\n\n# Print the result for Shenna\nprint(shenna_truth)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms that Shenna tells the truth. The logical deductions made in the reasoning process are consistent with the code execution.\n\n<<<Shenna tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Jerry lies.
