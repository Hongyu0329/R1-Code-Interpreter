    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on logical consistency. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Ka lies.\n2. Andree says Ka tells the truth.\n3. Audrie says Andree lies.\n4. Antwan says Audrie tells the truth.\n5. Millie says Antwan tells the truth.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- If Ka lies, then Andree's statement that \"Ka tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Andree lies.\n- If Andree lies, then Audrie's statement that \"Andree lies\" is true. Therefore, Audrie tells the truth.\n- If Audrie tells the truth, then Antwan's statement that \"Audrie tells the truth\" is true. Therefore, Antwan tells the truth.\n- If Antwan tells the truth, then Millie's statement that \"Antwan tells the truth\" is true. Therefore, Millie tells the truth.\n\nThis logical chain suggests that Millie tells the truth. Let's verify this reasoning with a simple Python script to ensure consistency.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values for each person\nka_truth = False  # Ka lies\nandree_truth = not ka_truth  # Andree says Ka tells the truth\naudrie_truth = not andree_truth  # Audrie says Andree lies\nantwan_truth = audrie_truth  # Antwan says Audrie tells the truth\nmillie_truth = antwan_truth  # Millie says Antwan tells the truth\n\n# Print the result for Millie's truthfulness\nprint(millie_truth)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Millie does not tell the truth, which contradicts our initial logical reasoning. Let's re-evaluate the logic:\n\n1. Ka lies.\n2. Andree says Ka tells the truth. Since Ka lies, Andree's statement is false, so Andree lies.\n3. Audrie says Andree lies. Since Andree lies, Audrie's statement is true, so Audrie tells the truth.\n4. Antwan says Audrie tells the truth. Since Audrie tells the truth, Antwan's statement is true, so Antwan tells the truth.\n5. Millie says Antwan tells the truth. Since Antwan tells the truth, Millie's statement is true, so Millie tells the truth.\n\nThe logical reasoning and the code should align, but the code output was `False`. Let's correct the code logic to ensure it matches our reasoning:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values for each person\nka_truth = False  # Ka lies\nandree_truth = not ka_truth  # Andree says Ka tells the truth\naudrie_truth = not andree_truth  # Audrie says Andree lies\nantwan_truth = audrie_truth  # Antwan says Audrie tells the truth\nmillie_truth = antwan_truth  # Millie says Antwan tells the truth\n\n# Print the result for Millie's truthfulness\nprint(millie_truth)\n```\n\nThe code logic seems correct, but the output was unexpected. Let's re-evaluate the logical steps and ensure the code reflects the reasoning accurately. If the code output is `False`, it suggests a contradiction in the logical assumptions or an error in the code logic. Let's verify the logical consistency again:\n\n- Ka lies, so Andree lies.\n- Audrie tells the truth, so Antwan tells the truth.\n- Millie tells the truth.\n\nThe code should reflect this logic. Let's ensure the code logic is correct and re-run it to verify the output. If the code output is still `False`, it indicates a logical contradiction or an error in the reasoning process.\n\nLet's re-run the code to verify the output.",
