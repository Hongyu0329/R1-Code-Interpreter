    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We will analyze the statements logically:\n\n1. **Teressa lies.**\n2. **Kristian says Teressa lies.**\n3. **Sal says Kristian tells the truth.**\n4. **Audrie says Sal lies.**\n5. **Leda says Audrie lies.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Teressa lies, then Kristian's statement \"Teressa lies\" is true.\n- If Kristian's statement is true, then Sal's statement \"Kristian tells the truth\" is also true.\n- If Sal's statement is true, then Audrie's statement \"Sal lies\" must be false, meaning Sal tells the truth.\n- If Audrie's statement is false, then Leda's statement \"Audrie lies\" is true.\n\nThus, if Teressa lies, Leda tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite scenario:\n\n- If Teressa tells the truth, then Kristian's statement \"Teressa lies\" is false.\n- If Kristian's statement is false, then Sal's statement \"Kristian tells the truth\" is false.\n- If Sal's statement is false, then Audrie's statement \"Sal lies\" is true, meaning Sal lies.\n- If Audrie's statement is true, then Leda's statement \"Audrie lies\" is false.\n\nThus, if Teressa tells the truth, Leda lies.\n\nSince Leda's truthfulness depends on Teressa's truthfulness, and we have shown that if Teressa lies, Leda tells the truth, we can conclude that Leda tells the truth.\n\nLet's confirm this logic with a simple Python script to verify the consistency of these statements.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Teressa lies\n    teressa_lies = True\n    kristian_truth = teressa_lies  # Kristian says Teressa lies\n    sal_truth = kristian_truth  # Sal says Kristian tells the truth\n    audrie_truth = not sal_truth  # Audrie says Sal lies\n    leda_truth = not audrie_truth  # Leda says Audrie lies\n\n    return leda_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nThe code will check the consistency of the statements and determine if Leda tells the truth.",
    "The code output indicates that Leda tells the truth when we assume Teressa lies. This confirms our logical deduction that Leda indeed tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Leda tells the truth.>>>"
