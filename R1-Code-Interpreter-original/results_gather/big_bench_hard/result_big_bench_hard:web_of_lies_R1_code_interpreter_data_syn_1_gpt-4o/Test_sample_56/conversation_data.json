    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Millicent tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Millicent always tells the truth.\n\n2. **Millie says Millicent tells the truth.**\n   - Since Millicent tells the truth, Millie's statement is true.\n\n3. **Michael says Millie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Millie tells the truth (as she correctly stated that Millicent tells the truth), Michael's statement is true.\n\n4. **Antwan says Michael lies.**\n   - Since Michael tells the truth, Antwan's statement is false.\n\n5. **Alexis says Antwan tells the truth.**\n   - Since Antwan's statement is false, Alexis's statement is also false.\n\nNow, let's summarize the truthfulness of each person:\n- Millicent: True\n- Millie: True\n- Michael: True\n- Antwan: False\n- Alexis: False\n\nTherefore, Alexis does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<Alexis does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Millicent tells the truth.
