    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - This means Rashida's statement is true.\n\n2. **Willian says Rashida lies.**\n   - If Willian is telling the truth, then Rashida is lying, which contradicts Rashida's statement that she tells the truth. Therefore, Willian must be lying.\n\n3. **Christie says Willian lies.**\n   - Since Willian is indeed lying (as determined in step 2), Christie's statement is true.\n\n4. **Ryan says Christie lies.**\n   - Since Christie is telling the truth (as determined in step 3), Ryan's statement is false, meaning Ryan is lying.\n\n5. **Shaunda says Ryan lies.**\n   - Since Ryan is lying (as determined in step 4), Shaunda's statement is true.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- Rashida tells the truth.\n- Willian lies.\n- Christie tells the truth.\n- Ryan lies.\n- Shaunda tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, Shaunda is telling the truth.\n\n<<<Shaunda tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Rashida tells the truth.
