    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement and see if it aligns with the others. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Audrie lies.\n2. Sherrie says Audrie lies.\n3. Willian says Sherrie tells the truth.\n4. Conception says Willian tells the truth.\n5. Gwenn says Conception lies.\n\nWe need to determine if Gwenn tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements:\n\n- If Audrie lies, then Sherrie's statement is true.\n- If Sherrie's statement is true, then Willian's statement is also true.\n- If Willian's statement is true, then Conception's statement is true.\n- If Conception's statement is true, then Gwenn's statement is false.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because if Gwenn's statement is false, then Conception's statement is false, which means Willian's statement is false, and so on. Therefore, Audrie must be telling the truth, which means Sherrie's statement is false.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n- If Audrie tells the truth, then Sherrie's statement is false.\n- If Sherrie's statement is false, then Willian's statement is false.\n- If Willian's statement is false, then Conception's statement is false.\n- If Conception's statement is false, then Gwenn's statement is true.\n\nThis scenario does not create any contradictions. Therefore, Gwenn tells the truth.\n\n<<<Gwenn tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Audrie lies.
