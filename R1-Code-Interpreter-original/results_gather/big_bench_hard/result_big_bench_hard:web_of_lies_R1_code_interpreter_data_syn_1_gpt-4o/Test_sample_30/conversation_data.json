    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We will analyze the statements logically:\n\n1. **Kandi tells the truth.**\n2. **Michaela says Kandi lies.**\n3. **Vernell says Michaela lies.**\n4. **Antwan says Vernell tells the truth.**\n5. **Sal says Antwan lies.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Kandi tells the truth, then Michaela's statement that Kandi lies is false. Therefore, Michaela lies.\n- If Michaela lies, then Vernell's statement that Michaela lies is true. Therefore, Vernell tells the truth.\n- If Vernell tells the truth, then Antwan's statement that Vernell tells the truth is true. Therefore, Antwan tells the truth.\n- If Antwan tells the truth, then Sal's statement that Antwan lies is false. Therefore, Sal lies.\n\nNow, let's verify this logic using a Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Kandi tells the truth\n    kandi_truth = True\n    \n    # Michaela says Kandi lies\n    michaela_truth = not kandi_truth\n    \n    # Vernell says Michaela lies\n    vernell_truth = not michaela_truth\n    \n    # Antwan says Vernell tells the truth\n    antwan_truth = vernell_truth\n    \n    # Sal says Antwan lies\n    sal_truth = not antwan_truth\n    \n    return sal_truth\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Sal does not tell the truth. This aligns with our logical deduction that Sal lies. Therefore, the final answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No, Sal does not tell the truth.>>>"
