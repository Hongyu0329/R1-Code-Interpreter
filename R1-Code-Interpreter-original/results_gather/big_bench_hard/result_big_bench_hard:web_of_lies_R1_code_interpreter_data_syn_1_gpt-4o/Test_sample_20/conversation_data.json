    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We have a chain of statements where each person claims the previous person is lying. Let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Raymond tells the truth.\n2. Sal says Raymond lies.\n3. Alexis says Sal lies.\n4. Helene says Alexis lies.\n5. Elanor says Helene lies.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- If Raymond tells the truth, then Sal is lying.\n- If Sal is lying, then Raymond is telling the truth, which is consistent.\n- If Alexis says Sal lies, and Sal is indeed lying, then Alexis is telling the truth.\n- If Helene says Alexis lies, but Alexis is telling the truth, then Helene is lying.\n- If Elanor says Helene lies, and Helene is indeed lying, then Elanor is telling the truth.\n\nThis chain of reasoning suggests that Elanor is telling the truth. Let's verify this logic using a simple Python script to ensure consistency.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nraymond_truth = True\nsal_truth = not raymond_truth\nalexis_truth = not sal_truth\nhelene_truth = not alexis_truth\nelanor_truth = not helene_truth\n\n# Print the result for Elanor\nprint(elanor_truth)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output indicates that Elanor is telling the truth. This confirms our logical reasoning that the chain of statements is consistent with Elanor being truthful.\n\n<<<Elanor tells the truth.>>>"
