    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Millicent lies.\n2. Shenna says Millicent lies.\n3. Willian says Shenna tells the truth.\n4. Kandi says Willian lies.\n5. Vernell says Kandi lies.\n\nWe need to determine if Vernell tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Millicent lies, then Shenna's statement that \"Millicent lies\" is true.\n- If Shenna's statement is true, then Willian's statement that \"Shenna tells the truth\" is also true.\n- If Willian's statement is true, then Kandi's statement that \"Willian lies\" is false.\n- If Kandi's statement is false, then Vernell's statement that \"Kandi lies\" is true.\n\nThus, Vernell tells the truth. Let's confirm this logic with a simple Python script to ensure consistency.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values of each person's statement\nmillicent_lies = True\nshenna_truth = millicent_lies\nwillian_truth = shenna_truth\nkandi_truth = not willian_truth\nvernell_truth = not kandi_truth\n\n# Output whether Vernell tells the truth\nprint(vernell_truth)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Vernell tells the truth, which aligns with our logical analysis. Therefore, based on the given statements and the logical deductions, Vernell indeed tells the truth.\n\n<<<Vernell tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Millicent lies.
