    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Ryan lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. So, Ryan is lying.\n\n2. **Christie says Ryan lies.**\n   - Since Ryan actually lies, Christie's statement is true.\n\n3. **Amberly says Christie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Christie tells the truth, Amberly's statement is also true.\n\n4. **Shenna says Amberly tells the truth.**\n   - Since Amberly tells the truth, Shenna's statement is true.\n\n5. **Jamey says Shenna lies.**\n   - Since Shenna tells the truth, Jamey's statement is false.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n- Ryan lies.\n- Christie tells the truth.\n- Amberly tells the truth.\n- Shenna tells the truth.\n- Jamey lies.\n\nTherefore, Jamey does not tell the truth.\n\n<<<No, Jamey does not tell the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Ryan lies.
