    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the truthfulness of each person's statement. We will analyze the statements logically:\n\n1. **Fletcher lies.**\n2. **Teressa says Fletcher lies.**\n3. **Vernell says Teressa lies.**\n4. **Dallas says Vernell lies.**\n5. **Millicent says Dallas tells the truth.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Fletcher lies, then Teressa is telling the truth.\n- If Teressa is telling the truth, then Vernell is lying.\n- If Vernell is lying, then Dallas is telling the truth.\n- If Dallas is telling the truth, then Millicent is telling the truth.\n\nNow, let's verify this chain of logic:\n\n- Fletcher lies, so Teressa's statement that Fletcher lies is true.\n- Since Teressa is telling the truth, Vernell's statement that Teressa lies is false, meaning Vernell is lying.\n- Since Vernell is lying, Dallas's statement that Vernell lies is true, meaning Dallas is telling the truth.\n- Since Dallas is telling the truth, Millicent's statement that Dallas tells the truth is also true.\n\nTherefore, Millicent is telling the truth.\n\nLet's confirm this logic with a simple Python script to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\nfletcher_lies = True\nteressa_truth = fletcher_lies\nvernell_lies = not teressa_truth\ndallas_truth = not vernell_lies\nmillicent_truth = dallas_truth\n\n# Output the result\nprint(millicent_truth)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Millicent is indeed telling the truth. The logical deductions we made are consistent with the code execution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Millicent tells the truth.>>>"
