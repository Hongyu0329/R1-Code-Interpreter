    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. Audrie lies.\n2. Conception says Audrie lies.\n3. Teressa says Conception tells the truth.\n4. Delfina says Teressa lies.\n5. Helene says Delfina tells the truth.\n\nWe need to determine if Helene tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- If Audrie lies, then Conception's statement \"Audrie lies\" is true. Therefore, Conception tells the truth.\n- If Conception tells the truth, then Teressa's statement \"Conception tells the truth\" is also true. Therefore, Teressa tells the truth.\n- If Teressa tells the truth, then Delfina's statement \"Teressa lies\" is false. Therefore, Delfina lies.\n- If Delfina lies, then Helene's statement \"Delfina tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Helene lies.\n\nBased on this analysis, Helene does not tell the truth. \n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to verify the logic:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\naudrie_lies = True\nconception_truth = audrie_lies\nteressa_truth = conception_truth\ndelfina_lies = not teressa_truth\nhelene_truth = not delfina_lies\n\n# Print the result for Helene\nprint(helene_truth)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Helene tells the truth, which contradicts our logical reasoning. Let's revisit the logic:\n\n1. Audrie lies.\n2. Conception says Audrie lies. If Audrie lies, Conception tells the truth.\n3. Teressa says Conception tells the truth. If Conception tells the truth, Teressa tells the truth.\n4. Delfina says Teressa lies. If Teressa tells the truth, Delfina lies.\n5. Helene says Delfina tells the truth. If Delfina lies, Helene lies.\n\nThe logical reasoning shows that Helene should not be telling the truth. However, the code output suggests otherwise. Let's correct the logic in the code:\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values\naudrie_lies = True\nconception_truth = audrie_lies\nteressa_truth = conception_truth\ndelfina_truth = not teressa_truth\nhelene_truth = delfina_truth\n\n# Print the result for Helene\nprint(helene_truth)\n```\n\nLet's execute the corrected code to verify the result.",
    "The corrected code output is `False`, which aligns with our logical reasoning. This confirms that Helene does not tell the truth.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Helene does not tell the truth.>>>"
