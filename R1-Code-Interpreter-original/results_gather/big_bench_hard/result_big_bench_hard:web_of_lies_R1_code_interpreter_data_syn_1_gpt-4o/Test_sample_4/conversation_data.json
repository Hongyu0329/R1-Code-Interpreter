    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of each person based on the given information. Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. **Tamika lies.**\n2. **Raymond says Tamika tells the truth.**\n3. **Willian says Raymond tells the truth.**\n4. **Shaunda says Willian lies.**\n5. **Elanor says Shaunda tells the truth.**\n\nWe need to determine if Elanor tells the truth. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- Since Tamika lies, Raymond's statement that \"Tamika tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Raymond lies.\n- Since Raymond lies, Willian's statement that \"Raymond tells the truth\" is false. Therefore, Willian lies.\n- Since Willian lies, Shaunda's statement that \"Willian lies\" is true. Therefore, Shaunda tells the truth.\n- Since Shaunda tells the truth, Elanor's statement that \"Shaunda tells the truth\" is true.\n\nThus, Elanor tells the truth.\n\n<<<Elanor tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Tamika lies.
