    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Inga tells the truth.**\n   - If Inga tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Shenna says Inga lies.**\n   - If Shenna tells the truth, then Inga lies, which contradicts Inga's statement of telling the truth.\n   - If Shenna lies, then Inga tells the truth.\n\n3. **Rashida says Shenna tells the truth.**\n   - If Rashida tells the truth, then Shenna tells the truth, which means Inga lies.\n   - If Rashida lies, then Shenna lies, which means Inga tells the truth.\n\n4. **Ka says Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - If Ka tells the truth, then Rashida tells the truth, which means Shenna tells the truth, and Inga lies.\n   - If Ka lies, then Rashida lies, which means Shenna lies, and Inga tells the truth.\n\n5. **Shalonda says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - If Shalonda tells the truth, then Ka tells the truth, which means Rashida tells the truth, Shenna tells the truth, and Inga lies.\n   - If Shalonda lies, then Ka lies, which means Rashida lies, Shenna lies, and Inga tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Inga tells the truth, then Shenna must lie, Rashida must lie, Ka must lie, and Shalonda must lie.\n- If Inga lies, then Shenna tells the truth, Rashida tells the truth, Ka tells the truth, and Shalonda tells the truth.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is when Inga lies, which means Shenna, Rashida, Ka, and Shalonda all tell the truth.\n\nTherefore, Shalonda tells the truth.\n\n<<<Shalonda tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Inga tells the truth.
