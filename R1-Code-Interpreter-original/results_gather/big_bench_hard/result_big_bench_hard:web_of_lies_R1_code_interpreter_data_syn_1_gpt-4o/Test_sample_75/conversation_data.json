    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and determine the truthfulness of each statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Leda tells the truth.**\n   - If Leda tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Shalonda says Leda lies.**\n   - If Shalonda is telling the truth, then Leda is lying, which contradicts Leda's statement that she tells the truth. Therefore, Shalonda must be lying.\n\n3. **Shenna says Shalonda tells the truth.**\n   - Since Shalonda is lying, Shenna's statement that Shalonda tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Shenna is lying.\n\n4. **Christie says Shenna lies.**\n   - Since Shenna is lying, Christie's statement that Shenna lies is true. Therefore, Christie is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Crista says Christie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Christie is telling the truth, Crista's statement that Christie tells the truth is also true. Therefore, Crista is telling the truth.\n\nBased on this analysis, Crista is telling the truth. \n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to ensure consistency in our logic.\n\n```python\ndef check_truth():\n    # Initial assumptions\n    leda_truth = True  # Leda tells the truth\n    shalonda_truth = not leda_truth  # Shalonda says Leda lies\n    shenna_truth = shalonda_truth  # Shenna says Shalonda tells the truth\n    christie_truth = not shenna_truth  # Christie says Shenna lies\n    crista_truth = christie_truth  # Crista says Christie tells the truth\n\n    return crista_truth\n\nprint(check_truth())\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output indicates that Crista is indeed telling the truth. This confirms our logical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Crista tells the truth.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Question: Leda tells the truth.
