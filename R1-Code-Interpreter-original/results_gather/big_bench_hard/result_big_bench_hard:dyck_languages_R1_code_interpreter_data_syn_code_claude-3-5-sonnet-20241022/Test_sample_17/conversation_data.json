    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have an incomplete sequence of parentheses: \"< ( ( )\"\n   - We need to add characters to make it valid\n   - Valid means all brackets must be properly closed and in correct order\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - Check what brackets are currently open\n   - Determine what brackets need to be added to close them properly\n   - The closing must be in reverse order of opening\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(s):\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    # Mapping of closing to opening brackets\n    brackets = {')': '(', '>': '<'}\n    \n    # Process existing sequence\n    for char in s:\n        if char in '<(':  # Opening brackets\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in ')>':  # Closing brackets\n            if stack and stack[-1] == brackets[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Generate completion\n    completion = ''\n    # Process remaining open brackets in reverse order\n    while stack:\n        current = stack.pop()\n        if current == '(':\n            completion += ')'\n        elif current == '<':\n            completion += '>'\n    \n    print(f\"Original sequence: {s}\")\n    print(f\"Completion needed: {completion}\")\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {s + completion}\")\n\n# Test the input\ncomplete_sequence(\"< ( ( )\")\n```\n\nLooking at the code execution:\n1) We have \"< ( ( )\" as input\n2) Reading left to right:\n   - '<' is opened first\n   - Then '(' is opened twice\n   - One ')' closes one '('\n3) Still open (from first to last):\n   - '<'\n   - One '('\n4) To close properly, we need:\n   - ')' to close the remaining '('\n   - '>' to close the '<'\n\nThe answer should be the remaining closing brackets in the correct order: \")>\"\n\n<<<)>>>",
    "Based on the code output, I can now provide the final answer with complete confidence.\n\nThe code confirmed that:\n1) The original sequence \"< ( ( )\" has:\n   - One unclosed '(' bracket\n   - One unclosed '<' bracket\n2) The completion needed is \")>\" which will:\n   - First close the remaining open parenthesis with ')'\n   - Then close the open angle bracket with '>'\n3) The complete sequence becomes \"< ( ( ))>\"\n\nTherefore, to complete the original sequence \"< ( ( )\" properly, we need to add \")>\".\n\n<<<)>>>>"
