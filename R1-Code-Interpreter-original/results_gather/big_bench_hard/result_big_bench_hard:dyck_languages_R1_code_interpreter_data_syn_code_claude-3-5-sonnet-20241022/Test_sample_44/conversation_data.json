    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have an incomplete sequence of brackets\n   - We need to add closing brackets to make it valid\n   - We need to match brackets in the correct order\n\n2) Let's write a program that will:\n   - First verify the existing sequence\n   - Keep track of opening brackets\n   - Determine what closing brackets are needed in the correct order\n\n```python\ndef complete_brackets(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    pairs = {\n        '<': '>', \n        '{': '}',\n        '[': ']',\n        '(': ')'\n    }\n    \n    # Split the sequence into characters\n    chars = [c for c in sequence.strip() if c != ' ']\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process existing sequence\n    for char in chars:\n        if char in pairs.keys():  # Opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in pairs.values():  # Closing bracket\n            if not stack:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n            if char != pairs[stack.pop()]:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Generate needed closing brackets\n    completion = ''\n    while stack:\n        completion += pairs[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Print original + completion\n    print(f\"Original: {''.join(chars)}\")\n    print(f\"Completion needed: {completion}\")\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {''.join(chars) + completion}\")\n\n# Test the input\nsequence = \"< { } [ [ ( ( < { < { [ ] } > } > ) )\"\ncomplete_brackets(sequence)\n```\n\n3) Let's analyze the output:\n   - The program processes the sequence from left to right\n   - It keeps track of opening brackets in a stack\n   - When it finds a closing bracket, it matches it with the most recent opening bracket\n   - At the end, it generates the needed closing brackets in reverse order\n\n4) Looking at the output, we can determine the missing closing brackets needed to complete the sequence properly.\n\nThe sequence needs to be completed with closing brackets for the remaining opening brackets in the correct order.\n\n<<<[ ] ]>>>",
    "Based on the code output, I can now confirm the final answer.\n\nThe code has shown that:\n1) The original sequence \"<{}[[((<{<{[]}>}>))\" is valid so far\n2) To properly close all brackets, we need \"]]>\" in that specific order because:\n   - We have two unclosed '[' brackets\n   - We have one unclosed '<' bracket at the very beginning\n3) The complete sequence becomes \"<{}[[((<{<{[]}>}>))]]>\"\n\nTherefore, the missing brackets needed to complete the sequence are:\n\n<<<]]>>>>"
