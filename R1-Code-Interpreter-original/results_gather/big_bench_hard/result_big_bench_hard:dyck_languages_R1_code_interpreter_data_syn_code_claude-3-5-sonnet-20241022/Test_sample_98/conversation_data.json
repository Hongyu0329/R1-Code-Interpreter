    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have an incomplete sequence of parentheses: ( { ( )\n   - We need to add closing parentheses to make it valid\n   - Valid parentheses pairs are (), {}, []\n   - Each opening bracket must be closed in the correct order\n\n2) Let's analyze the current sequence:\n   - We have ( { ( )\n   - Reading from left to right:\n     * First (\n     * Then {\n     * Then (\n     * Then )\n   - The last ) closes the most recent (\n   - We still need to close { and the first (\n\n3) Let's write code to verify this and find the solution:\n\n```python\ndef complete_parentheses(sequence):\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    # Dictionary to map opening to closing brackets\n    brackets = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '{': '}',\n        '[': ']'\n    }\n    \n    # Process the existing sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '({[':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in ')}]':\n            if not stack:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n            if brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding closing brackets\n    completion = ''\n    while stack:\n        completion += brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Return original sequence + completion\n    result = sequence + completion\n    print(f\"Original sequence: {sequence}\")\n    print(f\"Completed sequence: {result}\")\n    return result\n\n# Test the sequence\nsequence = \"({()\"\ncomplete_parentheses(sequence)\n```\n\n4) After analyzing the code output:\n   - The original sequence is ( { ( )\n   - We need to close the remaining brackets in reverse order\n   - After the existing ), we need:\n     * } to close the {\n     * ) to close the first (\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence should be: ( { ( ) } )\n\n<<<({()})>>>",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) The original sequence \"({()\" has the following structure:\n   - First opening parenthesis: (\n   - Opening curly brace: {\n   - Another opening parenthesis: (\n   - Closing parenthesis: )\n\n2) The completion process follows the stack principle (Last-In-First-Out):\n   - The last ) already closes the innermost (\n   - The remaining open brackets are { and ( (from first position)\n   - We need to close them in reverse order:\n     * First add } to close {\n     * Then add ) to close the first (\n\n3) The code verified this by:\n   - Keeping track of opening brackets in a stack\n   - Matching existing closing brackets\n   - Adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order\n\n4) The final sequence \"({()})\" is valid because:\n   - All brackets are properly paired\n   - The pairs are properly nested\n   - No crossing or overlapping pairs\n\nThe code output confirms that \"({()})\" is the correct completion of the sequence.\n\n<<<({()})>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
