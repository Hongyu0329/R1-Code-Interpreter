    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n   - We have a sequence of brackets that's partially complete\n   - We need to find what should be added at the beginning to make it valid\n   - The sequence must have properly matched pairs of brackets\n\n2) Let's write code to help us:\n   - We'll implement a function to check if a sequence is valid\n   - We'll try different combinations of opening brackets at the start\n   - We'll find the shortest valid solution\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(s):\n    stack = []\n    brackets = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in '([{':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in ')]}':\n            if not stack or stack.pop() != brackets[char]:\n                return False\n    return len(stack) == 0\n\ndef find_completion(end_sequence):\n    # All possible opening brackets we might need\n    opening = '([{'\n    sequence = end_sequence\n    \n    # Try adding up to 10 opening brackets (more than enough for this case)\n    for length in range(10):\n        if is_valid(sequence):\n            return ''  # If already valid, return empty string\n        \n        # Try all combinations of opening brackets\n        from itertools import product\n        for combo in product(opening, repeat=length):\n            test_sequence = ''.join(combo) + sequence\n            if is_valid(test_sequence):\n                return ''.join(combo)\n    \n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Test the sequence\nsequence = \"(([([])]))\"\ncompletion = find_completion(sequence)\nprint(f\"Required prefix: {completion}\")\n```\n\n3) Looking at the output and analyzing the sequence:\n   - The given sequence is \"(([([])]))\"\n   - The code will find the shortest valid prefix needed\n\n4) Analyzing the sequence manually:\n   - Working from inside out, we have [...] which is valid\n   - Then ([...]) which is valid\n   - Then ((...)) which is valid\n   - The sequence is already valid and balanced\n\n5) Therefore, no additional brackets are needed at the beginning.\n\n<<<>>>\n\nThe empty answer indicates that no additional brackets are needed at the beginning of the sequence, as the given sequence \"(([([])]))\" is already properly balanced.",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) Let's verify the given sequence \"(([([])]))\" from inside out:\n   - Innermost: [] - matched pair\n   - Next level: ([]) - matched pair\n   - Next level: (([()])) - matched pair\n   - All brackets are properly paired and nested\n\n2) To confirm this is correct, let's count the brackets:\n   - Opening brackets: 2 '(' + 1 '[' + 1 '[' = 4 opening brackets\n   - Closing brackets: 2 ')' + 1 ']' + 1 ']' = 4 closing brackets\n   - Each type matches with its corresponding pair\n\n3) The sequence follows proper nesting rules:\n   - Each inner pair is closed before its outer pair\n   - The types of brackets match correctly\n   - There are no unmatched brackets\n\n4) Since the sequence is already complete and valid, no additional brackets are needed at the beginning.\n\n<<<>>>\n\nThe empty string is the correct answer because the input sequence \"(([([])]))\" is already properly balanced and requires no additional brackets at the beginning."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
