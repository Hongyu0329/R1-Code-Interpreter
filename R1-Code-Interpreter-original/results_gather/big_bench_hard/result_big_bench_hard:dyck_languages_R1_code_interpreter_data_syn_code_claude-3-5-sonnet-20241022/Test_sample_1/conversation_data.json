    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n   - We have an opening sequence \"< [ [\"\n   - We need to close these brackets in the correct order\n   - For proper closure, we need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket in reverse order\n\n2) The brackets we have are:\n   - < : needs to be closed with >\n   - [ : needs to be closed with ]\n   - [ : needs to be closed with ]\n\n3) To close them properly, we need to go in reverse order:\n   - Last opened [ needs first closing ]\n   - Then the first [ needs closing ]\n   - Finally, < needs closing >\n\n4) Let's verify this with a simple Python code that checks if the brackets are balanced:\n\n```python\ndef check_brackets(sequence):\n    opening = \"< [ [\"\n    closing = \"] ] >\"\n    stack = []\n    \n    # First add all opening brackets to stack\n    for char in opening:\n        if char != ' ':\n            stack.append(char)\n    \n    # Then add closing brackets and check if they match\n    result = opening\n    for char in closing:\n        if char != ' ':\n            if not stack:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n            if (stack[-1] == '<' and char == '>') or \\\n               (stack[-1] == '[' and char == ']'):\n                stack.pop()\n                result += char\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    print(f\"Valid sequence: {result}\")\n    return result\n\ncheck_brackets(\"< [ [\")\n```\n\nBased on the code verification and our logical reasoning, we can determine that the proper closing sequence should be \"] ] >\", which when added to the original sequence gives \"< [ [ ] ] >\".\n\n<<<< [ [ ] ] >>>>",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. Let's break down the final answer:\n\n1) We started with \"< [ [\"\n2) The code verified that adding \"] ] >\" creates a valid sequence\n3) When we combine them, we get \"< [ [ ] ] >\"\n\nThis is correct because:\n- The innermost '[' is closed first with ']'\n- The second '[' is closed next with ']'\n- Finally, the '<' is closed with '>'\n\nThe sequence is properly nested and each bracket has its matching closing bracket in the correct order.\n\n<<<< [ [ ] ] >>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
