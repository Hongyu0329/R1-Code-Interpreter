    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have an incomplete sequence of brackets: ( [ ( )\n   - We need to add closing brackets to make it valid\n   - The sequence must follow proper nesting rules\n\n2) Key rules for valid bracket sequences:\n   - Each opening bracket must have a matching closing bracket\n   - Brackets must be closed in the correct order (last opened, first closed)\n   - Valid pairs are: (), [], {}\n\n3) Let's analyze the current sequence:\n   ( [ ( )\n   - We have an opening ( followed by [\n   - Then another ( which is closed by )\n   - We still need to close [ and the first (\n   - The correct closing order would be ] then )\n\nLet me write a code to verify this:\n\n```python\ndef verify_completion(original, completion):\n    # Combine original and completion\n    full_sequence = original + completion\n    stack = []\n    brackets = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}'}\n    \n    # Check if sequence is valid\n    for char in full_sequence:\n        if char in '([{':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in ')]}':\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            if char != brackets[stack.pop()]:\n                return False\n    \n    return len(stack) == 0\n\noriginal = '([()' \ncompletion = '])'\n\nprint(f\"Original sequence: {original}\")\nprint(f\"Completion: {completion}\")\nprint(f\"Full sequence: {original + completion}\")\nprint(f\"Is valid: {verify_completion(original, completion)}\")\n```\n\nBased on the code verification and our analysis, we can determine that the correct completion is \"])\" which will make the sequence \"([()])\" valid.\n\n<<<])>>>",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning was correct. The sequence \"([()])\" is valid because:\n\n1) The innermost pair () is properly closed\n2) The middle pair [] is then closed\n3) The outermost pair () is closed last\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<])>>>"
