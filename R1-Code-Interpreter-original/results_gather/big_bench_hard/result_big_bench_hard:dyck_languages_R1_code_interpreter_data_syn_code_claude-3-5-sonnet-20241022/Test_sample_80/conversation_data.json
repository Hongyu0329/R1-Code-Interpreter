    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have a sequence of brackets that's incomplete\n   - We need to add the proper closing brackets to make it valid\n   - We need to match brackets: () {} [] <> are valid pairs\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - First validate the existing sequence\n   - Keep track of opening brackets\n   - Determine what closing brackets are needed\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(s):\n    # Define matching brackets\n    brackets = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}',\n        '<': '>'\n    }\n    \n    # Process existing sequence\n    stack = []\n    input_sequence = s.replace(\" \", \"\")\n    \n    # First validate existing sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in brackets.keys():  # Opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in brackets.values():  # Closing bracket\n            if not stack:  # Stack empty but found closing bracket\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n            if char != brackets[stack[-1]]:  # Mismatched brackets\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n            stack.pop()\n    \n    # Now complete the sequence\n    completion = \"\"\n    while stack:\n        completion = brackets[stack.pop()] + completion\n    \n    print(f\"Original: {input_sequence}\")\n    print(f\"Completion needed: {completion}\")\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {input_sequence + completion}\")\n\n# Test with the given sequence\ntest_sequence = \"[ < [ { { < > [ ( ) ] ( ( ) ) } } ] > ] { { { ( < > )\"\ncomplete_sequence(test_sequence)\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output:\n1) The code processes the sequence from left to right\n2) It keeps track of opening brackets in a stack\n3) When it reaches the end, it adds the necessary closing brackets in reverse order\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n[ < [ { { < > [ ( ) ] ( ( ) ) } } ] > ] { { { ( < > ) } } }\n\nThe missing closing brackets should be \"}}}\" to properly close the three opening curly braces at the end.\n\n<<<}}}>>>",
