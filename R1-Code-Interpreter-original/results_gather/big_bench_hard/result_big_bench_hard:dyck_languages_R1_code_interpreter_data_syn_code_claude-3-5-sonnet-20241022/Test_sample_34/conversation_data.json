    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n   - We have an opening sequence \"< [ ]\"\n   - We need to complete it with proper closing parentheses\n   - The sequence should be balanced\n\n2) Rules for balanced parentheses:\n   - Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket\n   - The brackets must be closed in the correct order (last opened, first closed)\n\n3) Looking at \"< [ ]\":\n   - We have an opening \"<\"\n   - We have an opening \"[\"\n   - We have a closing \"]\" which matches the \"[\"\n   - We still need to close the \"<\" with \">\"\n\n4) Let's verify this with code:\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[', '>': '<'}\n    \n    # Complete the input sequence\n    input_seq = \"< [ ]\"\n    completed_seq = input_seq + \">\"\n    \n    print(f\"Testing sequence: {completed_seq}\")\n    \n    for char in completed_seq:\n        if char in '({[<':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in ')}]>':\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            if stack.pop() != brackets[char]:\n                return False\n    \n    return len(stack) == 0\n\nresult = is_balanced(\"< [ ]>\")\nprint(f\"Is balanced: {result}\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the completion should be: >\")\n```\n\nBased on the code verification and logical reasoning:\n- The sequence \"< [ ]\" needs to be completed with \">\" to make it balanced\n- This gives us \"< [ ]>\"\n- The inner brackets \"[ ]\" are already properly closed\n- The outer brackets \"< >\" will be properly closed with this addition\n\n<<<< [ ]>>>>",
    "Based on the code output and verification:\n- The code confirmed that adding \">\" to the sequence \"< [ ]\" creates a valid, balanced sequence\n- The test showed \"Is balanced: True\" for the sequence \"< [ ]>\"\n- All brackets are properly matched and closed in the correct order:\n  * The inner \"[ ]\" is already closed\n  * The outer \"< >\" will be closed with the addition of \">\"\n\nTherefore, I can now provide the final answer.\n\n<<<>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
