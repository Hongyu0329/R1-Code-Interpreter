    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to analyze the given sequence and understand what's missing:\n   - The sequence has opening and closing brackets of different types: [], {}, (), <>\n   - I need to ensure all brackets are properly matched\n   - I need to check the current state and find what's missing\n\n2) Let me write a Python script to:\n   - Validate the current sequence\n   - Find the missing part to complete it properly\n   - The script will use a stack-based approach to match brackets\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_brackets(sequence):\n    # Given sequence\n    input_seq = \"[ { ( { } ) } < < ( ) { { < [ { [ ( ) ] } ] > } } > >\"\n    \n    # Remove spaces\n    input_seq = input_seq.replace(\" \", \"\")\n    \n    # Initialize stack\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Define bracket pairs\n    brackets = {\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}',\n        '(': ')',\n        '<': '>'\n    }\n    \n    # Process the sequence\n    for char in input_seq:\n        if char in brackets.keys():  # Opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in brackets.values():  # Closing bracket\n            if not stack:  # Stack is empty but we found closing bracket\n                print(\"Invalid sequence\")\n                return\n            if char == brackets[stack[-1]]:  # Matches with top of stack\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid sequence\")\n                return\n    \n    # Generate missing closing brackets\n    missing = \"\"\n    while stack:\n        missing = brackets[stack.pop()] + missing\n    \n    print(f\"Missing brackets: {missing}\")\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {input_seq + missing}\")\n\nfind_missing_brackets(\"[ { ( { } ) } < < ( ) { { < [ { [ ( ) ] } ] > } } > >\")\n```\n\n3) After analyzing the sequence and running the code:\n   - The sequence starts with \"[\" but doesn't have a matching closing bracket \"]\"\n   - All other brackets appear to be properly matched within the sequence\n   - We need to add a closing square bracket \"]\" at the end\n\n4) The final answer should be the original sequence plus the missing closing bracket.\n\n<<<[ { ( { } ) } < < ( ) { { < [ { [ ( ) ] } ] > } } > > ]>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me verify the final answer:\n\n1) The code found that:\n   - Only one bracket was missing: \"]\"\n   - Adding this bracket at the end makes the sequence complete and valid\n   - The code validated that all other brackets are properly matched\n\n2) Let's verify the matching pairs from inside out:\n   - () is matched\n   - [] around () is matched\n   - {} around [] is matched\n   - <> around {} is matched\n   - >> matches with <<\n   - {} matches\n   - [] at the outermost level matches when we add the missing ]\n\n3) The sequence is now properly balanced with all brackets matched correctly.\n\n<<<[{({})}<<(){{<[{[()]}]>}}>>]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
