    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have a sequence of brackets that needs to be completed\n   - We need to ensure proper closing of all brackets\n   - We need to match brackets in the correct order\n\n2) Let's analyze the given sequence:\n   [ ( < { [ ( ) ] } >\n   \n3) Let's write a program to:\n   - Check what brackets are currently open\n   - Determine the correct closing sequence\n   - Verify the solution\n\n```python\ndef find_closing_sequence(input_str):\n    # Define matching brackets\n    brackets = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}',\n        '<': '>'\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize stack to keep track of open brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process input string\n    for char in input_str:\n        if char in brackets.keys():  # Opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in brackets.values():  # Closing bracket\n            if stack and brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Generate closing sequence\n    closing_sequence = ''\n    while stack:\n        closing_sequence = brackets[stack.pop()] + closing_sequence\n    \n    # Print original sequence and completion\n    print(f\"Original sequence: {input_str}\")\n    print(f\"Required closing brackets: {closing_sequence}\")\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {input_str + closing_sequence}\")\n\n# Test with given input\ninput_str = \"[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } >\"\nfind_closing_sequence(input_str)\n```\n\n4) After analyzing the code output:\n   - We start with: [ ( < { [ ( ) ] } >\n   - Working from inside out:\n     * All inner brackets up to '>' are properly closed\n     * We need to close the remaining open brackets in reverse order\n\n5) The remaining open brackets are:\n   - '[' from the beginning\n   - '(' after the first '['\n   - '<' before the '{'\n\n6) Therefore, the closing sequence should be:\n   - First close '>' (already present)\n   - Then close ')'\n   - Finally close ']'\n\n<<<[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } > ) ]>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) Let's verify the matching pairs in the complete sequence:\n   [ ( < { [ ( ) ] } > ) ]\n   \n   Working from inside out:\n   - Innermost: ( ) matches\n   - Next level: [ ] matches\n   - Next level: { } matches\n   - Next level: < > matches\n   - Next level: ( ) matches\n   - Outermost: [ ] matches\n\n2) The code correctly identified that we needed:\n   - ')' to close the second opening parenthesis\n   - ']' to close the first opening square bracket\n\n3) The sequence is now properly balanced with all brackets having their corresponding closing pair in the correct order.\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } > ) ]>>>"
