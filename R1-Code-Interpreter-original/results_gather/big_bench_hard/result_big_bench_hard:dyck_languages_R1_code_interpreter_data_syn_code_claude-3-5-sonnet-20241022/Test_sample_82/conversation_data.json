    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have a sequence of brackets: < { ( { } ) < > }\n   - We need to complete it so all brackets are properly closed\n   - We need to analyze what's missing\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - Track opening and closing brackets\n   - Find what brackets are missing\n   - Ensure proper nesting order\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_brackets(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    pairs = {\n        '<': '>', \n        '{': '}', \n        '(': ')'\n    }\n    \n    # Remove spaces and convert to list\n    sequence = ''.join(sequence.split())\n    \n    # Stack to track opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process existing sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '<{(':  # Opening brackets\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in '>})':  # Closing brackets\n            if not stack:\n                continue\n            if (char == '>' and stack[-1] == '<') or \\\n               (char == '}' and stack[-1] == '{') or \\\n               (char == ')' and stack[-1] == '('):\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Generate missing closing brackets\n    missing = ''\n    while stack:\n        missing = pairs[stack.pop()] + missing\n    \n    print(f\"Original sequence: {sequence}\")\n    print(f\"Missing brackets: {missing}\")\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {sequence + missing}\")\n\n# Test the sequence\nfind_missing_brackets(\"< { ( { } ) < > }\")\n```\n\n3) Analyzing the output:\n   - The sequence has unmatched opening brackets\n   - We need to add closing brackets in the correct order\n   - The code will help us find the missing brackets\n\nLooking at the code output, we can determine the missing brackets to properly close the sequence.\n\n<<<< { ( { } ) < > } >>>>",
    "Based on the code output, let me analyze the result:\n\n1) The original sequence: <{({})<>}\n2) The code found that we need one '>' bracket to complete the sequence\n3) Let's verify this manually:\n   - < (needs closing)\n   - { (needs closing)\n   - ( (closed by ))\n   - { (closed by })\n   - < (closed by >)\n   - } (closes the second {)\n   - Indeed, we need one '>' to close the first '<'\n\n4) The sequence matching goes like this:\n   < ... > (outermost)\n   { ... } (second level)\n   ( ... ) (inner pair)\n   { ... } (innermost)\n   < ... > (inner pair)\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence with proper closing is:\n\n<<<< { ( { } ) < > } > >>>>"
