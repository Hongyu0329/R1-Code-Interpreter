    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're dealing with:\n   - We have a sequence of brackets/parentheses\n   - We need to complete it ensuring all brackets are properly closed\n   - Current sequence: < < { ( < ( ) > ) }\n   - We need to match each opening bracket with a corresponding closing bracket\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - Verify the current sequence\n   - Keep track of unclosed brackets\n   - Determine what brackets are needed to complete the sequence\n\n```python\ndef find_completion(sequence):\n    # Map of opening to closing brackets\n    brackets = {\n        '<': '>',\n        '{': '}',\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']'\n    }\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process existing sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in brackets.keys():  # Opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in brackets.values():  # Closing bracket\n            # Find corresponding opening bracket\n            for opening, closing in brackets.items():\n                if closing == char:\n                    if stack and stack[-1] == opening:\n                        stack.pop()\n                    break\n    \n    # Generate completion\n    completion = ''\n    while stack:\n        opening = stack.pop()\n        completion = brackets[opening] + completion\n    \n    print(f\"Original sequence: {sequence}\")\n    print(f\"Needed completion: {completion}\")\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {sequence + completion}\")\n\n# Test with the given sequence\nsequence = \"< < { ( < ( ) > ) }\"\nsequence = sequence.replace(\" \", \"\")\nfind_completion(sequence)\n```\n\n3) Analyzing the code output:\n   - The code tracks each opening bracket and matches it with its closing bracket\n   - For any remaining unmatched opening brackets, it adds the corresponding closing brackets in reverse order\n\n4) Looking at the sequence:\n   < < { ( < ( ) > ) }\n   - Working from left to right:\n   - First '<' needs '>'\n   - Second '<' needs '>'\n   - '{' needs '}'\n   - All other brackets are already matched\n\nTherefore, the completion should be: > >\n\n<<<> >>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) Let's verify the sequence step by step:\n   <<{(<()>)}>>\n   \n   From left to right:\n   - First '<' matches with last '>'\n   - Second '<' matches with second-to-last '>'\n   - '{' matches with '}'\n   - '(' matches with ')'\n   - '<' matches with '>'\n   \n2) The code correctly identified that we needed two closing '>' brackets because:\n   - We had two opening '<' brackets at the beginning that weren't matched\n   - All other brackets in the sequence were properly matched\n   - The closing brackets must be added in the correct order to maintain proper nesting\n\n3) To verify this is correct, let's count the brackets:\n   Original sequence: <<{(<()>)}\n   - Opening brackets: 2 '<', 1 '{', 2 '(', total = 5\n   - Closing brackets: 2 '>', 1 '}', 1 ')', total = 4\n   - We needed 1 more closing bracket to match all opening brackets\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the answer is:\n\n<<<> >>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
