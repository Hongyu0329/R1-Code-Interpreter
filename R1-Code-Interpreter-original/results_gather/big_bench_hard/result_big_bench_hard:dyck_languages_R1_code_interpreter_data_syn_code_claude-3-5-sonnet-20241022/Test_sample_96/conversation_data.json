    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n   - We have a sequence of brackets: < < { } >\n   - We need to complete it so all brackets are properly closed\n   - The sequence starts with two opening < brackets, has a matched {} pair, and one closing >\n\n2) Let's write a program to verify our solution and find the missing brackets:\n   - We'll implement a stack-based solution\n   - We'll try different completions and verify which one is correct\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    brackets = {'>': '<', '}': '{', ')': '('}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '<{(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in '>})':\n            if not stack or stack.pop() != brackets[char]:\n                return False\n    return len(stack) == 0\n\ndef complete_sequence(partial):\n    original = partial\n    stack = []\n    # Track opening brackets\n    for char in partial:\n        if char in '<{(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in '>})':\n            if stack and stack[-1] == {'>' : '<', '}': '{', ')': '('}[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Add closing brackets for remaining opening brackets\n    completion = ''\n    while stack:\n        bracket = stack.pop()\n        if bracket == '<':\n            completion += '>'\n        elif bracket == '{':\n            completion += '}'\n        elif bracket == '(':\n            completion += ')'\n    \n    result = original + completion\n    print(f\"Original sequence: {original}\")\n    print(f\"Completed sequence: {result}\")\n    print(f\"Is valid: {is_valid_sequence(result)}\")\n    return result\n\n# Test the sequence\nsequence = \"<<{}>\"\ncomplete_sequence(sequence)\n```\n\n3) Analyzing the output:\n   - We have two opening < brackets at the start\n   - We have a matched {} pair in the middle\n   - We have one closing > bracket\n   - To properly close the sequence, we need one more > bracket\n\n4) The reasoning:\n   - The first < matches with the last >\n   - The second < needs another > to be closed\n   - The {} pair is already properly matched\n   - Therefore, we need to add one > at the end\n\n<<<< < { } > >>>>",
    "Based on the code output and verification, let me explain the final answer:\n\n1) The code confirmed that:\n   - The sequence \"<<{}>\" needs one more closing bracket\n   - Adding one \">\" makes the sequence valid\n   - The final sequence \"<<{}>>\" is properly balanced\n\n2) The verification shows:\n   - All brackets are properly matched\n   - The outer pair: first < matches with last >\n   - The inner pair: second < matches with second-to-last >\n   - The middle pair: { matches with }\n   - The sequence is now complete and valid\n\nTherefore, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<< < { } > >>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
