    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have an incomplete sequence of brackets\n   - We need to add closing brackets to make it valid\n   - The brackets must match in the correct order\n\n2) Let's write a program that will:\n   - Parse the input string\n   - Keep track of opening brackets\n   - Determine what closing brackets are needed\n   - Validate the sequence\n\n```python\ndef complete_brackets(s):\n    # Map of closing brackets to opening brackets\n    brackets_map = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    opening_brackets = {'(', '[', '{', '<'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process existing sequence\n    input_sequence = s.replace(\" \", \"\")\n    result = list(input_sequence)\n    \n    # First pass: check existing sequence and build stack\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in opening_brackets:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in brackets_map:\n            if not stack or stack[-1] != brackets_map[char]:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n            stack.pop()\n    \n    # Second pass: complete the sequence\n    closing_map = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    completion = ''\n    \n    # Add closing brackets in reverse order\n    while stack:\n        opening_bracket = stack.pop()\n        completion += closing_map[opening_bracket]\n    \n    final_sequence = input_sequence + completion\n    \n    print(f\"Original: {input_sequence}\")\n    print(f\"Completion needed: {completion}\")\n    print(f\"Final sequence: {final_sequence}\")\n    return completion\n\n# Test the input\ninput_str = \"[[<[([<[]>])]>]({}\"\ncomplete_brackets(input_str)\n```\n\n3) After analyzing the code output:\n   - The sequence starts with: [[<[([<[]>])]>]({} \n   - We need to close the remaining opening brackets\n   - The brackets must be closed in the reverse order they were opened\n\n4) Looking at the remaining open brackets:\n   - We have an open curly brace {\n   - It needs to be closed with }\n\nTherefore, the completion needed is simply \"}\"\n\n<<<}>>>",
