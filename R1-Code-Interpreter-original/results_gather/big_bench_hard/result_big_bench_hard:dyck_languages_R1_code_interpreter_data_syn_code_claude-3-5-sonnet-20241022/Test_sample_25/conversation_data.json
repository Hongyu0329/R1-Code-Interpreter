    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have a sequence of brackets: [ < { [ ] } > \n   - We need to complete it so all brackets are properly closed\n   - We need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket\n\n2) Let's analyze the current sequence:\n   - Going from left to right: [ < { [ ] } >\n   - We can use a stack to check which brackets are still open\n   - Let's write code to help us analyze and complete the sequence\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_brackets(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    pairs = {\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}',\n        '<': '>',\n        '(': ')'\n    }\n    \n    # Convert sequence to list for easier manipulation\n    sequence = list(sequence.replace(\" \", \"\"))\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # First pass: check what brackets are still open\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in pairs.keys():  # Opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in pairs.values():  # Closing bracket\n            if stack and pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Generate missing closing brackets\n    missing = ''\n    while stack:\n        missing = pairs[stack.pop()] + missing\n    \n    # Combine original sequence with missing brackets\n    result = ''.join(sequence) + missing\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {result}\")\n    print(f\"Missing brackets: {missing}\")\n\n# Test the sequence\nfind_missing_brackets(\"[ < { [ ] } >\")\n```\n\n3) Let's analyze the output:\n   - The sequence [ < { [ ] } > has the following structure:\n     * [ is opened first\n     * < is opened second\n     * { is opened third\n     * [ is opened fourth\n     * ] closes the innermost [\n     * } closes the {\n     * > closes the <\n     * The outermost [ is still open\n\n4) Based on the code output and analysis:\n   - We only need to close the outermost [\n   - The missing bracket is ]\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence should be: [ < { [ ] } > ]\n\n<<<[ < { [ ] } > ]>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis, and we can now be confident in our answer.\n\nThe code showed that:\n1. The original sequence \"[ < { [ ] } > \" had one unclosed bracket\n2. The missing closing bracket was \"]\"\n3. The complete sequence is \"[<{[]}>]\"\n\nThe code verified this by:\n1. Using a stack to track opening brackets\n2. Matching each closing bracket with its corresponding opening bracket\n3. Identifying that only the outermost \"[\" remained unclosed\n4. Adding the missing \"]\" at the end\n\nSince both the logical analysis and code verification align, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<[<{[]}>]>>>"
