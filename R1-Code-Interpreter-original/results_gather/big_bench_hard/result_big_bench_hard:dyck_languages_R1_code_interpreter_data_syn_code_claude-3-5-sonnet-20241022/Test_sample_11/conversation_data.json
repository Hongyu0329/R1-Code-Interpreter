    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n   - We have a sequence of brackets: [ { < ( ) > }\n   - We need to complete it so all brackets are properly closed\n   - The sequence already has some matching pairs: ( )\n   - We need to match: [, {, <, >, }\n\n2) Let's write a program to help us verify bracket matching and find the missing brackets:\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_brackets(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    pairs = {\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}',\n        '<': '>',\n        '(': ')'\n    }\n    \n    # Convert input to list for easier manipulation\n    brackets = list(sequence.replace(\" \", \"\"))\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process existing sequence\n    for bracket in brackets:\n        if bracket in pairs.keys():  # Opening bracket\n            stack.append(bracket)\n        elif bracket in pairs.values():  # Closing bracket\n            if not stack:\n                continue\n            if bracket == pairs[stack[-1]]:\n                stack.pop()\n            \n    # Generate missing closing brackets\n    missing = ''\n    while stack:\n        missing = pairs[stack.pop()] + missing\n        \n    # Print original sequence and completed sequence\n    print(f\"Original sequence: {sequence}\")\n    print(f\"Missing brackets: {missing}\")\n    print(f\"Complete sequence: {sequence + missing}\")\n\n# Test the function\nfind_missing_brackets(\"[ { < ( ) > }\")\n```\n\n3) Analyzing the output:\n   - We have opening brackets: [, {, <\n   - We have closing brackets: ), >, }\n   - The ( ) pair is complete\n   - The < > pair is complete\n   - The { } pair is complete\n   - The [ needs a closing ]\n\n4) Following the last-in-first-out principle of bracket matching:\n   - The last unclosed bracket is [\n   - Therefore, we need to add ] at the end\n\n<<<[ { < ( ) > } ]>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) Let's verify the matching pairs in the completed sequence:\n   - [ ] : outermost pair (matches)\n   - { } : second pair (matches)\n   - < > : third pair (matches)\n   - ( ) : innermost pair (matches)\n\n2) The sequence follows proper nesting rules:\n   - Each pair of brackets is properly nested inside the outer pairs\n   - The order of closing brackets is the reverse of the opening brackets\n   - No overlapping brackets\n\n3) The final sequence [ { < ( ) > } ] has these properties:\n   - It's complete\n   - All brackets are matched\n   - The nesting order is maintained\n   - No extra brackets are needed\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the answer is:\n\n<<<[ { < ( ) > } ]>>>"
