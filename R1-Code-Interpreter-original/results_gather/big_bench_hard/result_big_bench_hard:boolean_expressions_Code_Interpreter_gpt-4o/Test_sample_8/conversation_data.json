    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `not True or (False and True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(False and True)`. \n   - `False and True` evaluates to `False` because both conditions need to be true for the result to be true.\n\n2. Apply the NOT operator: `not True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. Evaluate the OR operation: `False or False`.\n   - `False or False` evaluates to `False` because at least one condition needs to be true for the result to be true.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<False>>>."
