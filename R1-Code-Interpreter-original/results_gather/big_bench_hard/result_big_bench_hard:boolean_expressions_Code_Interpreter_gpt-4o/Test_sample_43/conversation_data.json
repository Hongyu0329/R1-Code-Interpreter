    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `not False or True and not not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n2. `not not True` evaluates to `True`.\n3. Now the expression becomes `True or True and True`.\n4. According to the order of operations, we evaluate `and` before `or`. So, `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n5. Now the expression is `True or True`.\n6. Finally, `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nThe answer is <<<True>>>."
