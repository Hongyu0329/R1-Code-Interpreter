    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `(False and True or not False)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Evaluate `False and True`: This becomes `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the `and` operator to return `True`.\n3. Evaluate `False or True`: This becomes `True` because at least one operand is `True` for the `or` operator to return `True`.\n\nSo, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<True>>>."
