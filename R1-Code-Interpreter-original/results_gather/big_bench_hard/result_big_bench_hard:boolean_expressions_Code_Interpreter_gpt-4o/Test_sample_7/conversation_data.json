    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `True and not False or (True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(True)` which is `True`.\n2. Evaluate `not False`, which is `True`.\n3. Evaluate `True and True`, which is `True`.\n4. Finally, evaluate `True or True`, which is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<True>>>."
