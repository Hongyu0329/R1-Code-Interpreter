    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression \\(( \\text{not not True and not False} )\\), we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **not not True**: The \"not\" operator negates the boolean value. So, \"not True\" is False, and \"not not True\" is True.\n\n2. **not False**: The \"not\" operator negates False, making it True.\n\n3. **True and True**: The \"and\" operator returns True if both operands are True. Since both are True, the result is True.\n\nTherefore, the expression evaluates to True.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
