    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `not not False or not False or True`, we need to follow the logical operations step by step:\n\n1. `not not False` evaluates to `True` because `not False` is `True`, and `not True` is `False`.\n2. `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n3. The expression now becomes `True or True or True`.\n\nThe logical OR operation (`or`) returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since all operands are `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
