    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `False or (False) and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(False)` which is simply `False`.\n2. Evaluate the NOT operation: `not False` which is `True`.\n3. Evaluate the AND operation: `False and True` which is `False`.\n4. Finally, evaluate the OR operation: `False or False` which is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<False>>>."
