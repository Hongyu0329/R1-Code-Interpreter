    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `False or not not not False and True`, we need to follow the order of operations, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. Not\n3. And\n4. Or\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not not not False`:\n   - `not False` is `True`\n   - `not True` is `False`\n   - `not False` is `True`\n\n2. Now the expression becomes `False or True and True`.\n\n3. Evaluate `True and True`:\n   - This is `True`.\n\n4. Now the expression is `False or True`.\n\n5. Evaluate `False or True`:\n   - This is `True`.\n\nSo, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<True>>>."
