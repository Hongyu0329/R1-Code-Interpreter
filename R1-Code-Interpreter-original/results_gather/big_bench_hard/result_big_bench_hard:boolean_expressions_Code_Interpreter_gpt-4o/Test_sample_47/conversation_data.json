    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `not not (not False or True)`, we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost expression: `not False` is `True`.\n2. The expression becomes `not not (True or True)`.\n3. Evaluate the `or` operation: `True or True` is `True`.\n4. The expression becomes `not not True`.\n5. Evaluate the first `not`: `not True` is `False`.\n6. Evaluate the second `not`: `not False` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<True>>>."
