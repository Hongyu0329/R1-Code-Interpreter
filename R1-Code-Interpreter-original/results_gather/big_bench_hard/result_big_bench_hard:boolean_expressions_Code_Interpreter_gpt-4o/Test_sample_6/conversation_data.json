    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `not True and (False or True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(False or True)`. This evaluates to `True` because `False or True` is `True`.\n2. Apply the NOT operator: `not True`. This evaluates to `False`.\n3. Evaluate the AND operation: `False and True`. This evaluates to `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<False>>>."
