    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `not not False or False and not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. `not not False` evaluates to `True` because `not False` is `True`, and `not True` is `False`, so `not not False` is `True`.\n2. `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n3. Now the expression becomes `True or False and False`.\n4. According to the order of operations, we evaluate `False and False` first, which is `False`.\n5. Now the expression is `True or False`.\n6. `True or False` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
