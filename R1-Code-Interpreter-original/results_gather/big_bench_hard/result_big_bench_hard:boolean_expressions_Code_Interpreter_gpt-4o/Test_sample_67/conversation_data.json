    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `True and not False or False and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Evaluate `True and True`: This becomes `True`.\n3. Evaluate `False and False`: This becomes `False`.\n4. Evaluate `True or False`: This becomes `True`.\n\nSo, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
