    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `False and False or not (True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(True)` which is `True`.\n2. Apply the NOT operator: `not (True)` becomes `False`.\n3. Evaluate the AND operation: `False and False` is `False`.\n4. Evaluate the OR operation: `False or False` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<False>>>."
