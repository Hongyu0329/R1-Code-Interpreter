    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `False or (False and not False)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `False and not False`\n   - `not False` is `True`\n   - `False and True` is `False`\n\n2. Now substitute back into the original expression: `False or False`\n   - `False or False` is `False`\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<False>>>."
