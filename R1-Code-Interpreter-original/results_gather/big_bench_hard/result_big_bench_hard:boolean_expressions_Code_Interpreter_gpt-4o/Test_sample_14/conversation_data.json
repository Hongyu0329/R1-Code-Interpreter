    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `not not True and not True or True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. `not not True` evaluates to `True` because `not True` is `False`, and `not False` is `True`.\n2. `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n3. Now the expression becomes `True and False or True`.\n4. `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n5. Now the expression is `False or True`.\n6. `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nSo, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>"
