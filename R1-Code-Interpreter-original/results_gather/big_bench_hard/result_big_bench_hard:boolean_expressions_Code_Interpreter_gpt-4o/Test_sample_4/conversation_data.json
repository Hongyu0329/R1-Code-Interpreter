    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `True or not False and True and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. The expression now is `True or True and True and False`.\n3. Evaluate `True and True`: This becomes `True`.\n4. The expression now is `True or True and False`.\n5. Evaluate `True and False`: This becomes `False`.\n6. The expression now is `True or False`.\n7. Evaluate `True or False`: This becomes `True`.\n\nSo, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<True>>>."
