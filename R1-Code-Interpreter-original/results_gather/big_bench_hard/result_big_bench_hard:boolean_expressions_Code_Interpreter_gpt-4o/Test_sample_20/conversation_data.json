    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `True and False or (not True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(not True)` which is `False`.\n2. Now the expression becomes: `True and False or False`.\n3. Evaluate the `AND` operation: `True and False` which is `False`.\n4. Now the expression becomes: `False or False`.\n5. Evaluate the `OR` operation: `False or False` which is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<False>>>."
