    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `True and not not (not False)`, we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost expression: `not False` is `True`.\n2. Evaluate `not not True`: The first `not` negates `True` to `False`, and the second `not` negates `False` back to `True`.\n3. Finally, evaluate `True and True`: This results in `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
