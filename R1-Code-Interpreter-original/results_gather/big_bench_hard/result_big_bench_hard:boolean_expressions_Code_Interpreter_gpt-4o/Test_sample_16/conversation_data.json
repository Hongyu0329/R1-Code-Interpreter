    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `not not False and not not not False`, we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. `not False` is `True`.\n2. `not not False` is `not True`, which is `False`.\n3. `not not not False` is `not not True`, which is `not False`, which is `True`.\n\nNow, the expression becomes `False and True`.\n\nThe `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
