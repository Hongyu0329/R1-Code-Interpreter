    "\nassistant > To evaluate the expression `(not False and (True))`, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. `not False` evaluates to `True` because the negation of `False` is `True`.\n2. The expression then becomes `True and True`.\n3. `True and True` evaluates to `True` because both operands are `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<True>>>"
