    "\nassistant > To solve the expression `False and False and False or not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Evaluate `False and False and False`: This remains `False` because all operands are `False`.\n3. Evaluate `False or True`: This becomes `True` because at least one operand is `True`.\n\nSo, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\nThe final answer is <<<True>>>."
