    "In the sentence \"The guard called the cleaner and asked them to open the door,\" the pronoun \"them\" is used. The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a person or people previously mentioned. In this context, \"them\" could refer to either \"the guard\" or \"the cleaner.\" However, since the sentence structure is \"The guard called the cleaner and asked them to open the door,\" it is more likely that \"them\" refers to \"the cleaner,\" as the cleaner is the one being called and asked to perform an action. \n\nTherefore, the most logical antecedent for \"them\" is \"the cleaner.\" However, without additional context, it could be interpreted as ambiguous because \"them\" could technically refer to either party. \n\nGiven the options:\n(A) Asked the guard\n(B) Asked the cleaner\n(C) Ambiguous\n\nThe most appropriate choice is:\n(B) Asked the cleaner\n\n<<<answer>>>"
