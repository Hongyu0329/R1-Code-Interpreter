    "In the sentence \"The assistant asked the physician if they could borrow some money,\" the pronoun \"they\" is used. The antecedent of \"they\" could refer to either \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\" \n\n- If \"they\" refers to \"the assistant,\" it means the assistant is asking if they themselves could borrow some money.\n- If \"they\" refers to \"the physician,\" it means the assistant is asking if the physician could borrow some money.\n\nSince the sentence does not provide enough context to determine which of the two is the correct antecedent, the pronoun \"they\" is ambiguous in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<answer>>>"
