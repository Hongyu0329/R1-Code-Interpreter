    "In the sentence \"The customer and the chef discuss her culinary training,\" the pronoun \"her\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"her,\" we need to consider the context and typical usage of pronouns.\n\nIn English, pronouns usually refer to the most recently mentioned noun that matches in gender and number. In this sentence, \"her\" is a singular feminine pronoun. The two potential antecedents are \"the customer\" and \"the chef.\" Without additional context, we cannot definitively determine which one \"her\" refers to, as both could potentially be female.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of \"her\" is ambiguous because the sentence does not provide enough information to clearly identify whether it refers to the customer or the chef.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
