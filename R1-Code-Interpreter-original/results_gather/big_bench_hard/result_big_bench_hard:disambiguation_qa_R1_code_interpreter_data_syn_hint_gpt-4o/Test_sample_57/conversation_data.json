    "In the given sentence, \"The mechanic called to inform the customer that her car would be ready in the morning,\" the pronoun \"her\" is used. The context of the sentence suggests that the mechanic is providing information to the customer about a car. The use of \"her\" indicates possession, and since the mechanic is informing the customer, it is logical to deduce that \"her car\" refers to the customer's car. The mechanic is likely providing a service to the customer, which involves the customer's car.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" is the customer's car.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(B) It was the customer's car\n\n<<<answer>>>"
