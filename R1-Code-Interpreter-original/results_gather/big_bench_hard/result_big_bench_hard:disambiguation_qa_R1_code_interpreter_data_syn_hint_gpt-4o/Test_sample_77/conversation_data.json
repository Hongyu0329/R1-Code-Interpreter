    "In the sentence \"The technician told the customer that they could pay with cash,\" the pronoun \"they\" is used. The pronoun \"they\" could refer to either \"the technician\" or \"the customer.\" \n\n- If \"they\" refers to \"the technician,\" it would mean that the technician could pay with cash.\n- If \"they\" refers to \"the customer,\" it would mean that the customer could pay with cash.\n\nSince the sentence does not provide enough context to determine which of the two is the correct antecedent, the pronoun \"they\" is ambiguous in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<answer>>>"
