    "In the sentence \"The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave him some tips,\" the pronoun \"him\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"him,\" we need to identify the gender typically associated with the roles mentioned and the context of the sentence.\n\n1. \"The chief\" is typically a role that can be associated with any gender, but in this context, it is not specified.\n2. \"The housekeeper\" is also a role that can be associated with any gender, but traditionally, it might be more commonly associated with females, although this is not definitive.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that the chief is the one performing the action of giving tips. The pronoun \"him\" is likely referring to the person who received the tips. Since \"him\" is a masculine pronoun, it is more likely referring to the housekeeper in this context, assuming the housekeeper is male.\n\nTherefore, the most logical interpretation is that the chief gave the housekeeper some tips.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(B) Gave the housekeeper some tips\n\n<<<answer>>>"
