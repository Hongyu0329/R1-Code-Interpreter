    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The nurse was running from the laborer because he smelled awful.\"\n\nIn this sentence, \"he\" is a pronoun that refers to a male individual. The sentence provides two male entities: \"the nurse\" and \"the laborer.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used to explain the reason why the nurse was running from the laborer. \n\nThe most logical interpretation is that the laborer is the one who \"smelled awful,\" which caused the nurse to run away. This is because the sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship, where the action of running is a response to the unpleasant smell. Therefore, the pronoun \"he\" most likely refers to \"the laborer.\"\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n(B) The laborer smelled awful\n\n<<<answer>>>"
