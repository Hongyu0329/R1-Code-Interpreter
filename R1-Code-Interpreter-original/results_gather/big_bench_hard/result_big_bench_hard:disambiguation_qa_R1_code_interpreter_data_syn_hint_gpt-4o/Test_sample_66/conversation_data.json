    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they used big words,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. The sentence has two subjects: \"The developer\" and \"the writer.\"\n2. The pronoun \"they\" is used to refer to one of these subjects.\n3. The phrase \"used big words\" is the action attributed to \"they.\"\n\nThe sentence structure does not provide a clear indication of which subject \"they\" refers to. Both the developer and the writer could potentially use big words, and the sentence does not specify which one is the case. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine the antecedent of \"they.\"\n\nThus, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous <<<answer>>>"
