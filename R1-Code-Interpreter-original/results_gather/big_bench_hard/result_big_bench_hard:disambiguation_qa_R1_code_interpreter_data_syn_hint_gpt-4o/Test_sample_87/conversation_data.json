    "In the given sentence, \"The manager sent a message to the secretary, but she didn't reply yet,\" the pronoun \"she\" is used. The task is to determine the antecedent of \"she.\"\n\n1. The sentence structure suggests that the manager is the one who sent the message, and the secretary is the recipient.\n2. The pronoun \"she\" is used in the second clause, \"but she didn't reply yet.\"\n3. Typically, in English, pronouns refer to the most recently mentioned noun that matches in gender and number. In this case, \"the secretary\" is the most recent female noun mentioned before \"she.\"\n4. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that \"she\" refers to \"the secretary.\"\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct option is:\n(A) The secretary didn't reply yet\n\n<<<answer>>>"
