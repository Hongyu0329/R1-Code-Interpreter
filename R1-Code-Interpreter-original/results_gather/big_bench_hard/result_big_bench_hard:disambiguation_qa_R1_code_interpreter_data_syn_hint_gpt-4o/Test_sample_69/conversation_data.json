    "In the given sentence, \"The patient disclosed to the counselor that he had a history of substance abuse,\" the pronoun \"he\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"he,\" we need to consider the context and the structure of the sentence.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"The patient disclosed to the counselor,\" which suggests that the patient is the one providing information. The phrase \"that he had a history of substance abuse\" follows, indicating that the history of substance abuse is being disclosed. In this context, it is logical to infer that the patient is the one with the history of substance abuse, as it is common for a patient to disclose personal information about themselves to a counselor.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is \"The patient,\" making option (A) the correct choice.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The patient had a history <<<answer>>>"
