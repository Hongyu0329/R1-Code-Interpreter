    "In the sentence \"The construction worker called the editor and told him the whole story,\" the pronoun \"him\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"him,\" we need to consider the context and structure of the sentence.\n\nThe sentence structure is as follows:\n- The construction worker is the subject who performed the action of calling.\n- The editor is the object of the call.\n- The construction worker then told \"him\" the whole story.\n\nIn this context, \"him\" most logically refers to the editor, as the construction worker is the one who is telling the story. The sentence implies that the construction worker is the one who has the story to tell, and the editor is the recipient of the story.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of \"him\" is the editor.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(B) Told the editor the story\n\n<<<answer>>>"
