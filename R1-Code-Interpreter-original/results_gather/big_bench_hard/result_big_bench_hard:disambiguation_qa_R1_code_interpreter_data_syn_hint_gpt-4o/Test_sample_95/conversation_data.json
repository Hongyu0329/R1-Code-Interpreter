    "In the given sentence, \"The developer met with the secretary because they made a mistake,\" the pronoun \"they\" is used. The pronoun \"they\" is typically used as a plural pronoun or as a singular gender-neutral pronoun. In this context, it is unclear whether \"they\" refers to \"the developer\" or \"the secretary.\" \n\nSince the sentence does not provide any additional context or clues to determine which individual made the mistake, the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" is ambiguous. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether the developer or the secretary made the mistake.\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<answer>>>"
