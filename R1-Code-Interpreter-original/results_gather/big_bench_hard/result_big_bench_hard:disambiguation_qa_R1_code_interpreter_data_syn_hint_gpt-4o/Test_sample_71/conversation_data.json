    "In the given sentence, \"The developer met with the secretary because she made a mistake,\" the pronoun \"she\" is used. The task is to determine the antecedent of \"she,\" which means identifying who \"she\" refers to in the sentence.\n\nLet's analyze the sentence:\n\n- \"The developer met with the secretary\" is the main clause.\n- \"because she made a mistake\" is the subordinate clause providing the reason for the meeting.\n\nThe pronoun \"she\" could refer to either \"the developer\" or \"the secretary.\" However, in English, pronouns typically refer to the nearest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. In this case, \"she\" is more likely to refer to \"the secretary\" because \"secretary\" is the closest noun that matches the gender of \"she.\"\n\nHowever, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \"she\" refers to \"the developer\" or \"the secretary.\" Therefore, the sentence is ambiguous.\n\nThe correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
