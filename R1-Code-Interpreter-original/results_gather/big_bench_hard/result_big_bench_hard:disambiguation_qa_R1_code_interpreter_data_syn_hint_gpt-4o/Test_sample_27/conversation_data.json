    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The secretary corrected the developer because they better understood the problem,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The secretary corrected the developer\" and \"because they better understood the problem.\" The pronoun \"they\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"they\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is unknown or non-binary. In this sentence, \"they\" could refer to either \"the secretary\" or \"the developer,\" as both are singular nouns.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence provides a reason for the action of correcting: \"because they better understood the problem.\" This implies that the person who better understood the problem is the one who is more knowledgeable or has a better grasp of the situation, which is why they corrected the other person.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Without additional context, it is unclear whether \"they\" refers to \"the secretary\" or \"the developer.\" Both interpretations are plausible:\n   - If \"they\" refers to \"the secretary,\" it means the secretary corrected the developer because the secretary had a better understanding of the problem.\n   - If \"they\" refers to \"the developer,\" it means the secretary corrected the developer despite the developer having a better understanding of the problem, which could imply a misunderstanding or miscommunication.\n\nGiven the lack of additional context to definitively determine which interpretation is correct, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
