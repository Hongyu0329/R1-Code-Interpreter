    "In the given sentence, the pronoun \"they\" is used to refer to the subject who had purchased the house. To determine the antecedent of \"they,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\nThe sentence is: \"The homeowner asked the inspector if the house they had purchased was structurally sound.\"\n\n- \"The homeowner\" is the subject who is asking the question.\n- \"The inspector\" is the person being asked.\n- \"The house they had purchased\" refers to the house in question.\n\nThe pronoun \"they\" is used in the context of purchasing the house. In this sentence, \"they\" is most likely referring to \"the homeowner\" because it is more logical for the homeowner to be concerned about the structural soundness of a house they purchased. The inspector is typically the person who evaluates the house, not the one who purchases it.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of \"they\" is \"The homeowner.\"\n\nThe correct option is:\n(A) The homeowner had purchased\n\n<<<answer>>>"
