    "In the sentence \"The supervisor gave the employee feedback on their stellar performance,\" the pronoun \"their\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"their,\" we need to consider the context and the structure of the sentence.\n\n- The sentence mentions two parties: \"the supervisor\" and \"the employee.\"\n- The feedback is given by the supervisor to the employee.\n- The phrase \"stellar performance\" is likely referring to the performance of the person who received the feedback, which is the employee.\n\nTherefore, the pronoun \"their\" most logically refers to \"the employee\" in this context.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(B) It was the employee's performance\n\n<<<answer>>>"
