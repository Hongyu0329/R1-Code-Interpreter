    "In the sentence \"The mechanic disliked the cashier because they are arrogant,\" the pronoun \"they\" is used. The pronoun \"they\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when the gender is unknown or unspecified. However, in this context, it is used to refer to one of the two singular nouns: \"the mechanic\" or \"the cashier.\"\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that \"they\" refers to the person whose arrogance is the reason for the mechanic's dislike. In English, it is more common for the pronoun to refer to the subject of the clause that follows the conjunction \"because.\" Therefore, \"they\" is more likely to refer to \"the cashier,\" as the sentence implies that the mechanic dislikes the cashier due to the cashier's arrogance.\n\nThus, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" in this context is \"the cashier.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The cashier is arrogant"
