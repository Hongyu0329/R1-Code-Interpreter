    "In the given sentence, \"The carpenter told the onlooker that they had been working on the house for three weeks,\" the pronoun \"they\" is used. The pronoun \"they\" is typically used to refer to a group of people or as a singular pronoun for a person whose gender is unknown or unspecified. \n\nIn this context, \"they\" could refer to either the carpenter or the onlooker. However, since the sentence structure is \"The carpenter told the onlooker that they had been working on the house for three weeks,\" it is more likely that \"they\" refers to the carpenter, as it is more common for the subject of the sentence (the carpenter) to be the one performing the action described in the subordinate clause. \n\nHowever, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \"they\" refers to the carpenter or the onlooker. Therefore, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
