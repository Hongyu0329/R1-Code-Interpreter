    "In the given sentence, \"The practitioner made a house call for the patient because they felt gravely ill,\" the pronoun \"they\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"they,\" we need to consider the context and the logical flow of the sentence.\n\n1. The sentence states that the practitioner made a house call for the patient. This implies that the action was taken due to a condition or situation related to the patient.\n\n2. The phrase \"because they felt gravely ill\" provides the reason for the house call. In typical scenarios, a house call by a practitioner is made because the patient is unwell, not because the practitioner is unwell.\n\n3. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that \"they\" refers to the patient, as the patient feeling gravely ill is the reason for the practitioner's house call.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct option is:\n\n(B) The patient felt ill\n\n<<<answer>>>"
