    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n\"The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist because he needed a lab assistant.\"\n\n- The sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: the undergraduate applied to work with the scientist due to a need for a lab assistant.\n- The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the undergraduate\" or \"the scientist.\"\n- Typically, in English, pronouns refer to the most recent noun of the same gender, which in this case would be \"the scientist.\"\n- However, the sentence could also imply that the undergraduate applied because he himself needed a lab assistant, perhaps for his own work or studies.\n\nGiven these considerations, the pronoun \"he\" could logically refer to either the undergraduate or the scientist, making it ambiguous without additional context.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<answer>>>"
