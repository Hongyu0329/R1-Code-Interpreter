    "In the sentence \"The cleaner called the guard and asked them to open the door,\" the pronoun \"them\" is used. The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a person or people whose gender is unknown or to refer to a group of people. In this context, \"them\" is used to refer to a singular person, which is a common usage in modern English to avoid gender-specific pronouns.\n\nThe sentence structure is such that \"The cleaner\" is the subject who performed the action of calling. The cleaner is also the one who asked someone to open the door. The pronoun \"them\" is used to refer to the person who was asked to open the door. Since the cleaner is the one doing the asking, \"them\" refers to the person who was called, which is \"the guard.\"\n\nTherefore, the pronoun \"them\" refers to \"the guard\" in this sentence.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(B) Asked the guard\n\n<<<answer>>>"
