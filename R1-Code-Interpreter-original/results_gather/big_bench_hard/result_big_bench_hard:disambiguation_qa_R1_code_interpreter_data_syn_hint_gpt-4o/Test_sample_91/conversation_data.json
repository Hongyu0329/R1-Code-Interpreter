    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"Alex did not know Taylor until he sent a letter,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. The sentence has two main parts: \"Alex did not know Taylor\" and \"until he sent a letter.\"\n2. The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"Alex\" or \"Taylor\" since both are male names and there is no additional context provided in the sentence to clarify who \"he\" refers to.\n3. Without further context or information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \"he\" refers to Alex or Taylor.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
