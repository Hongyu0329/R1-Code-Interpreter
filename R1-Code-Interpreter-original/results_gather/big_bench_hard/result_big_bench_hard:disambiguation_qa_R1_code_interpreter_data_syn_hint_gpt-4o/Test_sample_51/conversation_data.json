    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"The developer met with the designer because her idea can be implemented,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. The sentence involves two people: the developer and the designer.\n2. The pronoun \"her\" is a possessive pronoun, which typically refers to a female subject mentioned earlier in the sentence.\n3. In this sentence, \"her\" could refer to either the developer or the designer, depending on the gender of each person. However, without additional context, we cannot definitively determine the gender of the developer or the designer.\n4. Since both the developer and the designer are potential antecedents for \"her,\" and there is no additional context to clarify, the pronoun reference is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<answer>>>"
