    "In the given sentence, \"The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told them a fake story,\" the pronoun \"them\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"them,\" we need to look at the context of the sentence.\n\nThe sentence structure is: \"The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told them a fake story.\" Here, \"the writer\" is the subject who is performing the action of trying to fool someone. The object of this action is \"the salesperson.\" The conjunction \"and\" connects two actions performed by the same subject, \"the writer.\" Therefore, \"told them a fake story\" is an action performed by \"the writer\" on \"the salesperson.\"\n\nThus, the pronoun \"them\" refers to \"the salesperson,\" as it is the object of the actions performed by \"the writer.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(B) Told the salesperson a fake story\n\n<<<answer>>>"
