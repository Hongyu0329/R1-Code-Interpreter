    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The sheriff protected the writer because they uphold the peace,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. The sentence has two main parts: \"The sheriff protected the writer\" and \"because they uphold the peace.\"\n2. The pronoun \"they\" is used to refer to someone who upholds the peace.\n3. The sentence structure suggests a causal relationship: the sheriff's action of protecting the writer is because of the reason provided in the second part of the sentence.\n4. Typically, the pronoun refers to the subject of the clause it is in, unless context suggests otherwise. Here, \"they\" is in the clause \"because they uphold the peace.\"\n5. The pronoun \"they\" could refer to either \"the sheriff\" or \"the writer,\" but the sentence does not provide additional context to clearly indicate which one it is.\n6. Without further context, it is ambiguous whether \"they\" refers to \"the sheriff\" or \"the writer.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>>C) Ambiguous<<<answer>>>"
