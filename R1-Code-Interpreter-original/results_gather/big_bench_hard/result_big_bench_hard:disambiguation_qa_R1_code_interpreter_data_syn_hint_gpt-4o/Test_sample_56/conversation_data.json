    "In the given sentence, \"The hygienist told the patient that she should floss every day,\" the pronoun \"she\" could refer to either \"the hygienist\" or \"the patient.\" \n\n- If \"she\" refers to \"the hygienist,\" then the sentence means that the hygienist is advising herself to floss every day, which is unlikely in the context of a hygienist giving advice to a patient.\n- If \"she\" refers to \"the patient,\" then the sentence means that the hygienist is advising the patient to floss every day, which is more likely in the context of a hygienist giving advice to a patient.\n\nHowever, without additional context, it is not explicitly clear which one is intended. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous <<<answer>>>"
