    "In the given sentence, \"This story could not be published without the writer and his friends' support,\" the pronoun \"his\" is used. The pronoun \"his\" refers to the \"writer\" in the sentence. Therefore, the antecedent of \"his\" is the \"writer,\" and \"his friends\" refers to the friends of the writer.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) They were the writer's friends - This option is correct because \"his friends\" refers to the friends of the writer.\n\n(B) They were the friends' friends - This option is incorrect because the sentence does not imply that the friends have their own friends involved in the support.\n\n(C) They were the story's friends - This option is incorrect because the story does not have friends.\n\n(D) Ambiguous - This option is incorrect because the antecedent of \"his\" is clearly the \"writer.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>A"
