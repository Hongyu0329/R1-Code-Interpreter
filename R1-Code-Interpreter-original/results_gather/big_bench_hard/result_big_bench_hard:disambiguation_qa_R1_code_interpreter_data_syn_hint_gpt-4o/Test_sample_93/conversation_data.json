    "In the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam went to his office,\" the pronoun \"his\" refers to Sam. This is because the sentence structure suggests that the office belongs to the subject of the sentence, which is Sam. There is no indication that the office belongs to the producers, so the most logical antecedent for \"his\" is Sam.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The office was Sam's office.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
