    "In the given sentence, \"The mechanic greets the receptionist because she is standing in front of the door,\" the pronoun \"she\" is used. The task is to determine the antecedent of \"she.\"\n\n1. The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun \"she\" is referring to the person who is standing in front of the door.\n2. The sentence states that the mechanic greets the receptionist. The reason given for this action is that \"she is standing in front of the door.\"\n3. In typical English usage, when a pronoun is used, it usually refers to the most recently mentioned noun that matches in gender and number. In this case, \"she\" would most likely refer to \"the receptionist\" because \"receptionist\" is the most recent noun that matches the gender of \"she.\"\n4. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that \"she\" refers to \"the receptionist.\"\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct option is:\n(B) The receptionist is standing in front of the door\n\n<<<answer>>>"
