    "In the sentence \"The customer and the chef discuss his culinary training,\" the pronoun \"his\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"his,\" we need to consider the context and typical usage.\n\nIn this context, \"his\" is more likely to refer to the chef's culinary training rather than the customer's. This is because chefs are typically associated with having culinary training, whereas customers are not. Therefore, the most logical antecedent for \"his\" in this sentence is the chef.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n(B) It is the chef's culinary training\n\n<<<answer>>>"
