    "In the given sentence, \"The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise she would have to mop it all over again,\" the pronoun \"she\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"she,\" we need to consider the context and the roles of the individuals involved.\n\n1. The janitor is the one who is responsible for mopping the floor. It is logical to assume that if the floor gets dirty again, the janitor would be the one to mop it again.\n2. The child is being warned not to step on the wet floor. It is unlikely that the child would be responsible for mopping the floor if it gets dirty.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most logical antecedent for \"she\" is the janitor, as it aligns with the typical responsibilities and context provided in the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(A) The janitor would have to mop\n\n<<<answer>>>"
