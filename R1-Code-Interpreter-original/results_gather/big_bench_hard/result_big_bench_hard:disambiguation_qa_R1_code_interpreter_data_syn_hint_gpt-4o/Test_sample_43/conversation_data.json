    "In the sentence \"The educator was meeting with a student to discuss his grading policy,\" the pronoun \"his\" is used. The context of the sentence involves an educator and a student, and the discussion is about a grading policy. \n\nTypically, a grading policy is associated with an educator or an institution rather than a student. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that \"his grading policy\" refers to the educator's grading policy. \n\nThus, the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" is most likely the educator.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(A) It was the educator's grading policy\n\n<<<answer>>>"
