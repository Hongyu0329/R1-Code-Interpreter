    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n\"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case.\"\n\n1. **Subject and Pronoun Analysis**: \n   - The sentence has two main subjects: \"The lawyer\" and \"the cashier.\"\n   - The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**:\n   - The action described is \"looked into illegal accusations,\" which is performed by \"The lawyer.\"\n   - The reason given is \"because he needed to understand the case.\"\n\n3. **Logical Association**:\n   - It is more logical for the lawyer to need to understand the case, as it is part of his professional duty to investigate and comprehend the details of the accusations.\n   - The cashier, being the subject of the accusations, would not typically be the one needing to understand the case in the context of investigating accusations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pronoun \"he\" most likely refers to \"The lawyer.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The lawyer needed to understand.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
