    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because they asked,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Pronoun \"they\":** The pronoun \"they\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is unknown or non-binary. In this sentence, \"they\" is used as a singular pronoun.\n\n2. **Possible Antecedents:**\n   - \"The librarian\"\n   - \"The CEO\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis:**\n   - The sentence structure \"The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because they asked\" suggests that the action of asking is the reason for the librarian's help.\n   - Typically, the person who is being helped (in this case, the CEO) is the one who would ask for help. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that \"they\" refers to \"the CEO.\"\n\n4. **Ambiguity Consideration:**\n   - While it is more logical for \"they\" to refer to \"the CEO,\" the sentence does not provide explicit information to confirm this. The pronoun \"they\" could technically refer to either \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO,\" making it ambiguous without additional context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous because the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether \"they\" refers to \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous <<<answer>>>"
