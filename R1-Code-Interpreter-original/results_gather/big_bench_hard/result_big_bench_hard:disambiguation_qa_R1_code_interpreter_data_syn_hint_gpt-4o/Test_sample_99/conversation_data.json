    "In the sentence \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint,\" the pronoun \"them\" is used. The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is not specified. In this context, \"them\" could refer to either the designer or the carpenter, as both are involved in the collaboration. However, since \"them\" is used, it suggests that the blueprint was given to both the designer and the carpenter collectively, or it could be interpreted as referring to the carpenter if we assume a singular non-gendered usage. \n\nHowever, without additional context, it is not clear whether the blueprint was given specifically to the designer, the carpenter, or both. Therefore, the antecedent of \"them\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous"
