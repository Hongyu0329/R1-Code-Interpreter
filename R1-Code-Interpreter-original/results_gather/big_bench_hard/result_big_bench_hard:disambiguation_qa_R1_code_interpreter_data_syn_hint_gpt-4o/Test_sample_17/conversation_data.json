    "In the sentence \"The supervisor gave the employee feedback on his stellar performance,\" the pronoun \"his\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"his,\" we need to consider the context and the structure of the sentence.\n\nThe sentence structure is: \"The supervisor gave the employee feedback on his stellar performance.\"\n\n- \"The supervisor\" is the subject who is giving feedback.\n- \"The employee\" is the object receiving the feedback.\n- \"His stellar performance\" is the reason for the feedback.\n\nIn this context, it is more logical to assume that the feedback is being given to the employee for the employee's performance. Therefore, \"his\" most likely refers to \"the employee.\"\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n(B) It was the employee's performance\n\n<<<answer>>>"
