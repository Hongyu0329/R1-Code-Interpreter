    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The nurse was running from the laborer because she smelled awful.\"\n\n1. The pronoun \"she\" is typically used to refer to a female subject. In this sentence, the two subjects are \"the nurse\" and \"the laborer.\" Since \"the nurse\" is the only female subject mentioned, it is likely that \"she\" refers to \"the nurse.\"\n\n2. The sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: \"The nurse was running from the laborer because she smelled awful.\" This implies that the reason for the nurse's action (running away) is related to the subject of the pronoun \"she.\"\n\n3. If \"she\" refers to \"the nurse,\" it means the nurse is running away because she herself smells awful, which is a less likely scenario in terms of logical cause and effect.\n\n4. If \"she\" refers to \"the laborer,\" it means the nurse is running away because the laborer smells awful, which is a more plausible explanation for the nurse's action.\n\nBased on these points, the most logical antecedent for \"she\" is \"the laborer,\" as it provides a reasonable cause for the nurse's action of running away.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(B) The laborer smelled awful\n\n<<<answer>>>"
