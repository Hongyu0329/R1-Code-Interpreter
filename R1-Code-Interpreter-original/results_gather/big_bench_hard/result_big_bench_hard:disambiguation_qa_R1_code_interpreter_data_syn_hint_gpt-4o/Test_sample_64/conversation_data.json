    "In the sentence \"The reporter and the chef will discuss their favorite dishes,\" the pronoun \"their\" is used. The pronoun \"their\" is a plural possessive pronoun, which means it refers to something that belongs to more than one person. In this context, \"their\" refers to both the reporter and the chef. \n\nThe sentence does not specify whether the favorite dishes belong to the reporter, the chef, or both. Therefore, it is not clear whose favorite dishes are being discussed. The pronoun \"their\" could refer to the favorite dishes of either the reporter, the chef, or both. \n\nThus, the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous <<<answer>>>"
