    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n\"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she used big words.\"\n\n- The sentence structure suggests that \"she\" is the subject of the clause \"she used big words.\"\n- The pronoun \"she\" typically refers to a female subject. In this sentence, the two possible female subjects are \"the developer\" and \"the writer.\"\n- The sentence implies a reason for the developer's inability to communicate, which is \"because she used big words.\"\n- It is more logical to assume that the writer is the one using big words, as this would be the reason the developer is unable to communicate effectively. If the developer were using big words, it would not explain why the developer is unable to communicate with the writer.\n\nTherefore, the most logical antecedent for \"she\" in this context is \"the writer.\"\n\nThe correct option is (B) The writer uses big words.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
