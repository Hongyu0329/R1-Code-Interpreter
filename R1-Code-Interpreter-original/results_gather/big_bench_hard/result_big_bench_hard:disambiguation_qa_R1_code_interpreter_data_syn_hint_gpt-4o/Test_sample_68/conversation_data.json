    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor,\" we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence.\n\nThe sentence is structured as a complex sentence with a dependent clause (\"Before he sent the letter\") and an independent clause (\"Alex did not know Taylor\"). The pronoun \"he\" is used in the dependent clause, and we need to identify who \"he\" refers to.\n\nIn English, pronouns typically refer to the nearest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. In this sentence, the nearest preceding noun to \"he\" is \"Alex.\" Therefore, it is most logical to assume that \"he\" refers to \"Alex.\"\n\nThus, the sentence implies that Alex is the one who sent the letter. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(A) Alex sent the letter\n\n<<<answer>>>"
