    "In the sentence \"The student set up a meeting with the architect to review her blueprints,\" the pronoun \"her\" is used. The context of the sentence suggests that the meeting is set up to review blueprints. The pronoun \"her\" could refer to either the student or the architect, as both could potentially have blueprints to review.
