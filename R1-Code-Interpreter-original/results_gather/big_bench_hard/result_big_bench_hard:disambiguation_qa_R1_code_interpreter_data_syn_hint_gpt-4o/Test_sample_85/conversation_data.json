    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to their office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. The sentence begins with \"After meeting with the producers,\" which sets the context that Sam has interacted with the producers.\n2. The pronoun \"their\" is used in the phrase \"their office.\" In English, \"their\" is a possessive pronoun that typically refers to a group of people or entities previously mentioned.\n3. The only group mentioned in the sentence is \"the producers.\" Therefore, \"their\" logically refers to the producers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely antecedent for \"their\" is \"the producers.\" Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B) It is the producers' office\n\n<<<answer>>>"
