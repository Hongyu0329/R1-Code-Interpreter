    "In the sentence \"The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave her some tips,\" the pronoun \"her\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"her,\" we need to identify who the chief is giving tips to.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that the chief is performing two actions: thanking and giving tips. The direct object of the verb \"thanked\" is \"the housekeeper,\" and it is logical to assume that the subsequent action of giving tips is also directed towards the same person, unless otherwise specified.\n\nTherefore, the pronoun \"her\" most likely refers to \"the housekeeper,\" as she is the one being thanked and is the most recent female noun mentioned before the pronoun.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n(B) Gave the housekeeper some tips\n\n<<<answer>>>"
