    "In the given sentence, \"The carpenter told the onlooker that he had been working on the house for three weeks,\" the pronoun \"he\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"he,\" we need to consider the context and structure of the sentence.\n\nThe sentence structure is: \"The carpenter told the onlooker that he had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n\n- The main clause is \"The carpenter told the onlooker.\"\n- The subordinate clause is \"that he had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n\nIn English, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause, it typically refers to the subject of the main clause unless there is a clear reason to interpret it otherwise. Here, the subject of the main clause is \"The carpenter.\" Therefore, it is most logical to conclude that \"he\" refers to \"The carpenter.\"\n\nThere is no indication in the sentence that the onlooker was involved in working on the house, so the most straightforward interpretation is that \"he\" refers to \"The carpenter.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of \"he\" is \"The carpenter.\"\n\nThe correct option is:\n(A) The carpenter had been working on the house\n\n<<<answer>>>"
