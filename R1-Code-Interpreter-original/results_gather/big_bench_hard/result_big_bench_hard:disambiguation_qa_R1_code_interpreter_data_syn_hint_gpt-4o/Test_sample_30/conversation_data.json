    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold them some garbage.\"\n\nIn this sentence, \"them\" is a pronoun that refers to a noun mentioned earlier in the sentence. The sentence mentions two people: \"the salesperson\" and \"the writer.\" The pronoun \"them\" is used to refer to the person who was sold some garbage.\n\nThe structure of the sentence suggests that \"the salesperson\" is the one performing the action of selling, and \"the writer\" is the one being fooled and sold something. Therefore, \"them\" most likely refers to \"the writer.\"\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n(B) Sold the writer some garbage\n\nThe pronoun \"them\" refers to \"the writer\" in this context.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
