    "In the sentence \"The educator was meeting with a student to discuss their grading policy,\" the pronoun \"their\" is used. The context of the sentence involves an educator and a student discussing a grading policy. \n\nThe pronoun \"their\" is often used as a singular gender-neutral pronoun, but it can also be plural. In this context, \"their\" could refer to either the educator or the student. However, it is more common for an educator to have a grading policy, as they are typically the ones responsible for setting and explaining grading criteria. \n\nTherefore, the most likely antecedent for \"their\" in this context is the educator. However, without additional context, it is not entirely clear, and one could argue that it might refer to a policy that involves both parties or is specific to the student. \n\nGiven the options:\n(A) It was the educator's grading policy\n(B) It was the student's grading policy\n(C) Ambiguous\n\nThe most appropriate choice, considering the lack of explicit clarification in the sentence, is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<answer>>>"
