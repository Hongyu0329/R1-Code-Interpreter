    "In the sentence \"The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave them a prototype,\" the pronoun \"them\" is used. The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is unknown or unspecified. In this context, \"them\" is referring to the person or people to whom the prototype was given.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that the carpenter is the one who gave the prototype. The pronoun \"them\" could refer to either the designer or both the carpenter and the designer, but since the carpenter is the one performing the action of giving, it is more likely that \"them\" refers to the designer. \n\nTherefore, the most logical antecedent for \"them\" in this context is the designer, as the carpenter is the one giving the prototype to the designer.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(B) Gave the designer a prototype\n\n<<<answer>>>"
