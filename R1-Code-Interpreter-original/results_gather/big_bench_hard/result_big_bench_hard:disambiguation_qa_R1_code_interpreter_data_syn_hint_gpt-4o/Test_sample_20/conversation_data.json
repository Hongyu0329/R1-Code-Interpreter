    "In the given sentence, \"The worker told the pedestrian that they were repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible,\" the pronoun \"they\" is used. The task is to determine the antecedent of \"they.\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: \n   - The sentence involves two parties: the worker and the pedestrian.\n   - The action being discussed is \"repairing the sidewalk.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing the Pronoun \"They\"**:\n   - \"They\" is a plural pronoun, which typically refers to more than one person or a group.\n   - In the context of the sentence, \"they\" could refer to either the worker or the pedestrian, or possibly a group that includes the worker.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option (A)**: The worker was repairing. This is a plausible interpretation if \"they\" refers to the worker and possibly others involved in the repair work.\n   - **Option (B)**: The pedestrian was repairing. This is less likely because the pedestrian is typically not involved in repair work, especially if the worker is the one communicating about the repair.\n   - **Option (C)**: Ambiguous. Given that \"they\" is a plural pronoun and the sentence does not provide clear information about who is involved in the repair, it could be considered ambiguous.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most logical interpretation is that \"they\" refers to the worker and possibly others involved in the repair, but since the sentence does not specify, it could be considered ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous <<<answer>>>"
