    "In the given sentence, \"The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition,\" the pronoun \"he\" is used. We need to determine whether \"he\" refers to \"the patient\" or \"the specialist.\"\n\nLet's analyze the sentence:\n\n- The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the referral is the rare skin condition.\n- Typically, a patient is referred to a specialist because the patient has a condition that requires specialized care.\n- Therefore, it is logical to conclude that \"he\" refers to \"the patient,\" as it is the patient who would have the condition necessitating the referral.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the most likely antecedent for \"he\" is \"the patient.\"\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n(A) The patient had a skin condition\n\n<<<answer>>>"
