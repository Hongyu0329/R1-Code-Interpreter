    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The driver yelled at the tailor after he broke a window,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence is composed of two main parts: \"The driver yelled at the tailor\" and \"after he broke a window.\" The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the driver\" or \"the tailor.\"\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: There are no explicit contextual clues in the sentence that indicate who \"he\" refers to. Both the driver and the tailor are male, and the sentence does not provide additional information to clarify which one broke the window.\n\n3. **Ambiguity**: Since the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether \"he\" refers to \"the driver\" or \"the tailor,\" the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
