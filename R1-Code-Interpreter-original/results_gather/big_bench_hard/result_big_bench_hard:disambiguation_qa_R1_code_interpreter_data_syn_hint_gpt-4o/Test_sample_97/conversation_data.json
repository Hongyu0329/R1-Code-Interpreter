    "In the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office,\" the pronoun \"her\" is used to refer to the office. To determine the antecedent of \"her,\" we need to identify who \"her\" is referring to.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that \"her\" is referring to Sam. The phrase \"Sam goes to her office\" implies that the office belongs to Sam. If the office belonged to the producers, the sentence would likely be structured differently, such as \"Sam goes to their office\" or \"Sam goes to the producers' office.\"\n\nTherefore, the most logical antecedent for \"her\" in this context is Sam.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(A) It is Sam's office\n\n<<<answer>>>"
