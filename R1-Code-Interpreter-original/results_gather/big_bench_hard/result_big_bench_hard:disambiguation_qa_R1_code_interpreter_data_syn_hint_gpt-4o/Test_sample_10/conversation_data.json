    "In the sentence \"The mechanic disliked the cashier because he is arrogant,\" the pronoun \"he\" is used. To determine the antecedent of \"he,\" we need to consider the context and typical usage of pronouns in English.\n\nIn English, pronouns typically refer to the most recent noun of the same gender that was mentioned, unless there is a clear reason to refer to an earlier noun. In this sentence, \"he\" is a masculine pronoun, and the two masculine nouns are \"the mechanic\" and \"the cashier.\" The pronoun \"he\" follows \"the cashier\" more closely, which suggests that \"he\" refers to \"the cashier.\"\n\nAdditionally, the structure of the sentence implies a cause-and-effect relationship: the mechanic dislikes the cashier because of a characteristic attributed to \"he.\" It is more logical to assume that the characteristic (arrogance) belongs to the person being disliked (the cashier), rather than the person doing the disliking (the mechanic).\n\nTherefore, the most likely antecedent of \"he\" is \"the cashier.\"\n\nThe correct option is:\n(B) The cashier is arrogant\n\n<<<answer>>>"
