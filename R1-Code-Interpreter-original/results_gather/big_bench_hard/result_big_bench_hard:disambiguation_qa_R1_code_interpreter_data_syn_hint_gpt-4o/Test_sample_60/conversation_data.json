    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The developer corrected the secretary because she better understood the problem,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\nThe sentence is structured as follows:\n- \"The developer corrected the secretary\" is the main clause.\n- \"because she better understood the problem\" is the subordinate clause providing the reason for the correction.\n\nThe pronoun \"she\" in the subordinate clause refers to the person who better understood the problem. The sentence implies that the person who better understood the problem is the reason for the correction. Therefore, the pronoun \"she\" is likely referring to the person who has the better understanding, which is the developer in this context. \n\nThus, the correct interpretation is:\n(A) The developer understood the problem\n\nThe sentence suggests that the developer corrected the secretary because the developer had a better understanding of the problem.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
