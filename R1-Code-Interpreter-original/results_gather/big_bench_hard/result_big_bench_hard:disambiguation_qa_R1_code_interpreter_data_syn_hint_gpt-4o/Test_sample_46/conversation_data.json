    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because they needed to understand the case.\"\n\n1. **Subject Analysis**: The sentence has two main subjects: \"The lawyer\" and \"the cashier.\"\n2. **Pronoun \"they\"**: The pronoun \"they\" is used, which is a plural pronoun. However, in modern usage, \"they\" can also be used as a singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or to maintain gender neutrality.\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence states that someone needed to understand the case. Typically, the person investigating or looking into a case (in this case, the lawyer) would need to understand the case to proceed with their work. This suggests that \"they\" is more likely to refer to \"the lawyer.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the lawyer,\" as it aligns with the context of needing to understand the case to perform their duties.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(A) The lawyer needed to understand\n\n<<<answer>>>"
