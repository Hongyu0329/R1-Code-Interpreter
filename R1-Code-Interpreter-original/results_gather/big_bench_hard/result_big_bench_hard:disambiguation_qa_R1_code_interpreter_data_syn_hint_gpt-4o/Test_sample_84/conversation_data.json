    "In the given sentence, \"The mechanic greets the receptionist because he was in a good mood,\" the pronoun \"he\" is used. The pronoun \"he\" typically refers to a male subject mentioned earlier in the sentence. In this case, the two male subjects are \"the mechanic\" and \"the receptionist.\"\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that the action of greeting is motivated by the mood of the subject performing the action. Therefore, it is more likely that \"he\" refers to \"the mechanic,\" as it is the mechanic who is performing the action of greeting. The sentence implies that the mechanic's good mood is the reason for the greeting.\n\nThus, the most logical antecedent for \"he\" in this context is \"the mechanic.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The mechanic was in a good mood <<<answer>>>"
