    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The designer showed the cook a blueprint and asked him for feedback.\"\n\n- The sentence has two main characters: \"the designer\" and \"the cook.\"\n- The pronoun \"him\" is used in the context of asking for feedback.\n- Typically, feedback is requested from the person who is expected to provide an opinion or evaluation on something. In this context, it is more logical for the designer to ask the cook for feedback on the blueprint, as the cook might have insights or opinions relevant to the design.\n\nTherefore, the pronoun \"him\" most likely refers to \"the cook.\"\n\nThe correct option is:\n(B) Asked the cook\n\n<<<answer>>>"
