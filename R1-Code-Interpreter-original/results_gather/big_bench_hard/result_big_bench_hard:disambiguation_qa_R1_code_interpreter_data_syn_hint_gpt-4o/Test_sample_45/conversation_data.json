    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"Alex tells us that they could not meet,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Subject Identification**: The sentence has two main parts:\n   - \"Alex tells us\" is the main clause.\n   - \"that they could not meet\" is the subordinate clause.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"they\"**: The pronoun \"they\" is in the subordinate clause. We need to identify who \"they\" refers to.\n\n3. **Possible Antecedents**:\n   - \"Alex\" is a singular noun, so it is unlikely to be referred to by the plural pronoun \"they.\"\n   - \"us\" is a plural noun, which could potentially be referred to by \"they.\"\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: Without additional context, it is unclear whether \"they\" refers to a group that includes \"us\" or another group entirely. The sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine the antecedent of \"they.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous because the sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether \"they\" refers to \"us\" or another group.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) Ambiguous <<<answer>>>"
