    "In the given sentence, \"This story could not be published without the writer and their friends' support,\" the pronoun \"their\" is used. The antecedent of \"their\" is the noun that \"their\" refers to. \n\nIn this context, \"their\" is referring to the \"writer.\" The sentence is indicating that the support came from the writer and the writer's friends. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \"their\" refers to the writer's friends.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n(A) They were the writer's friends - This is correct because \"their\" refers to the writer's friends.\n(B) They were the friends' friends - This is incorrect because the sentence does not imply a second layer of friends.\n(C) They were the story's friends - This is incorrect because the story does not have friends.\n(D) Ambiguous - This is incorrect because the antecedent is clear.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) They were the writer's friends <<<answer>>>"
