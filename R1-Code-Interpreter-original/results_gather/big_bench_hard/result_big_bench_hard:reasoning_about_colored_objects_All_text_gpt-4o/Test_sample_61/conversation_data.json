    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the arrangement of items on the desk and identify the position of each item relative to the magenta sheet of paper. We are specifically looking for non-turquoise items that are to the left of the magenta sheet of paper.\n\n1. **Identify the items and their colors:**\n   - Magenta sheet of paper\n   - Pink fidget spinner\n   - Turquoise keychain\n   - Green pen\n\n2. **Determine the arrangement:**\n   - The items are arranged in a row as follows:\n     1. Magenta sheet of paper\n     2. Pink fidget spinner\n     3. Turquoise keychain\n     4. Green pen\n\n3. **Locate the magenta sheet of paper:**\n   - The magenta sheet of paper is the first item in the row.\n\n4. **Identify items to the left of the magenta sheet of paper:**\n   - Since the magenta sheet of paper is the first item in the row, there are no items to its left.\n\n5. **Count the non-turquoise items to the left of the magenta sheet of paper:**\n   - As there are no items to the left of the magenta sheet of paper, the count of non-turquoise items is zero.\n\n6. **Select the correct option:**\n   - The correct option that corresponds to zero is (A).\n\nTherefore, the number of non-turquoise things to the left of the magenta sheet of paper is zero.\n\nFinal answer: <<<A>>>."
