The sequence of items from left to right is: a gold mug, a teal paperclip, a blue plate, and an orange notebook.\n\nNow, let's identify the color of each item:\n\n- The first item is a \"gold mug,\" which means the color of this item is gold.\n- The second item is a \"teal paperclip,\" which means the color of this item is teal.\n- The third item is a \"blue plate,\" which means the color of this item is blue.\n- The fourth item is an \"orange notebook,\" which means the color of this item is orange.\n\nThe question asks for the color of the left-most item. Based on the sequence provided, the left-most item is the first item in the row, which is the \"gold mug.\"\n\nTherefore, the color of the left-most item is gold.\n\nNow, let's match this color with the options provided:\n\n- (A) red\n- (B) orange\n- (C) yellow\n- (D) green\n- (E) blue\n- (F) brown\n- (G) magenta\n- (H) fuchsia\n- (I) mauve\n- (J) teal\n- (K) turquoise\n- (L) burgundy\n- (M) silver\n- (N) gold\n- (O) black\n- (P) grey\n- (Q) purple\n- (R) pink\n\nThe color \"gold\" corresponds to option (N).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<N>>>"
