    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the items on the floor and determine which of them are yellow. Then, we will remove the yellow envelopes and count the remaining yellow items.\n\n1. **Identify Yellow Items:**\n   - Three yellow pairs of sunglasses: These are yellow items.\n   - One silver plate: This is not a yellow item.\n   - Three yellow cat toys: These are yellow items.\n   - Two yellow envelopes: These are yellow items.\n\n2. **Count the Total Number of Yellow Items:**\n   - Three yellow pairs of sunglasses\n   - Three yellow cat toys\n   - Two yellow envelopes\n\n   Total yellow items = 3 (sunglasses) + 3 (cat toys) + 2 (envelopes) = 8 yellow items.\n\n3. **Remove the Yellow Envelopes:**\n   - We are instructed to remove all the envelopes, which are two yellow envelopes.\n\n4. **Count the Remaining Yellow Items:**\n   - After removing the two yellow envelopes, we are left with:\n     - Three yellow pairs of sunglasses\n     - Three yellow cat toys\n\n   Remaining yellow items = 3 (sunglasses) + 3 (cat toys) = 6 yellow items.\n\n5. **Select the Correct Option:**\n   - The number of remaining yellow items is 6, which corresponds to option (G).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
