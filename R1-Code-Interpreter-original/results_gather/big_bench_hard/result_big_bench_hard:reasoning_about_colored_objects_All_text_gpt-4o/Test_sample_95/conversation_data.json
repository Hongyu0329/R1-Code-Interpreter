    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the objects on the nightstand and determine which ones are neither purple nor blue. Let's go through the objects one by one:\n\n1. **Yellow notebook**: This object is yellow, so it is neither purple nor blue.\n2. **Blue jug**: This object is blue, so it does not meet the criteria (we are looking for objects that are neither purple nor blue).\n3. **Red keychain**: This object is red, so it is neither purple nor blue.\n4. **Orange pencil**: This object is orange, so it is neither purple nor blue.\n5. **Purple fidget spinner**: This object is purple, so it does not meet the criteria (we are looking for objects that are neither purple nor blue).\n\nNow, let's count the objects that are neither purple nor blue:\n\n- Yellow notebook\n- Red keychain\n- Orange pencil\n\nThere are three objects that are neither purple nor blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) three.\n\n<<<three>>>"
