    "To determine the color of the left-most item on the table, we need to analyze the arrangement of the items as described:\n\n1. The items are arranged in a row.\n2. The items listed are:\n   - A mauve sheet of paper\n   - A purple booklet\n   - A blue necklace\n\n3. The order in which the items are listed suggests their arrangement from left to right. Therefore:\n   - The first item (left-most) is the mauve sheet of paper.\n   - The second item is the purple booklet.\n   - The third item (right-most) is the blue necklace.\n\n4. We need to identify the color of the left-most item, which is the first item in the list.\n\n5. The first item is described as a \"mauve sheet of paper.\"\n\n6. Therefore, the color of the left-most item is \"mauve.\"\n\n7. We need to match this color with the options provided.\n\n8.
