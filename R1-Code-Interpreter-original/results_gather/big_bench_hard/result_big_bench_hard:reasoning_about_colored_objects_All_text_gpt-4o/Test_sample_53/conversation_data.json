Let's go through the items one by one:\n\n1. **Red notebook**: This item is red, which is neither yellow nor black.\n2. **Purple dog leash**: This item is purple, which is neither yellow nor black.\n3. **Orange jug**: This item is orange, which is neither yellow nor black.\n4. **Brown crayon**: This item is brown, which is neither yellow nor black.\n5. **Yellow cup**: This item is yellow, so it does not meet the criteria of being neither yellow nor black.\n\nNow, let's count the items that are neither yellow nor black:\n\n- Red notebook\n- Purple dog leash\n- Orange jug\n- Brown crayon\n\nThere are four items that are neither yellow nor black.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
