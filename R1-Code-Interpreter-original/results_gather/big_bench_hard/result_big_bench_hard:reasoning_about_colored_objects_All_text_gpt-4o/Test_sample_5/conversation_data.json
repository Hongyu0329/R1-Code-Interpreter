Let's go through the list of objects step by step:\n\n1. **Green bracelet**: This object is green, so it is neither black nor blue.\n2. **Purple cat toy**: This object is purple, so it is neither black nor blue.\n3. **Brown pair of sunglasses**: This object is brown, so it is neither black nor blue.\n4. **Black fidget spinner**: This object is black, so it is black.\n5. **Red dog leash**: This object is red, so it is neither black nor blue.\n6. **Orange pen**: This object is orange, so it is neither black nor blue.\n\nNow, let's count the objects that are neither black nor blue:\n\n- Green bracelet\n- Purple cat toy\n- Brown pair of sunglasses\n- Red dog leash\n- Orange pen\n\nThere are 5 objects that are neither black nor blue.\n\nTherefore, the number of objects that are neither black nor blue is five.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<F>>>."
