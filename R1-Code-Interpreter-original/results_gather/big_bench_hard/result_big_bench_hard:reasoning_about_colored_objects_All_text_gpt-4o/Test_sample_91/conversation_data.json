    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the items on the table:**\n   - There are three teal bracelets.\n   - There are two grey dog leashes.\n\n2. **Understand the action to be performed:**\n   - The action is to remove all the dog leashes from the table.\n\n3. **Determine the impact of the action:**\n   - Removing the dog leashes does not affect the number of teal bracelets because the dog leashes are grey, not teal.\n\n4. **Count the remaining teal items:**\n   - Since the teal items are the bracelets and none of them are removed, all three teal bracelets remain on the table.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - The number of teal items remaining on the table is three.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D) three.\n\nFinal answer: <<<D>>>."
