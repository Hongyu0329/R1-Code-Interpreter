So, it counts.\n\n2. **Green jug**: This item is green, so it does not count.\n\n3. **Purple textbook**: This item is purple, which is neither black nor green. So, it counts.\n\n4. **Black booklet**: This item is black, so it does not count.\n\n5. **Yellow envelope**: This item is yellow, which is neither black nor green.
