    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the arrangement of items on the nightstand and identify the position of each item in relation to the others. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the items and their order:**\n   - The items are arranged in a row as follows:\n     1. Orange cat toy\n     2. Mauve pencil\n     3. Black crayon\n     4. Yellow pair of sunglasses\n\n2. **Locate the yellow thing:**\n   - The yellow thing is the \"yellow pair of sunglasses,\" which is the fourth item in the row.\n\n3. **Determine the items to the right of the yellow thing:**\n   - Since the yellow pair of sunglasses is the last item in the row, there are no items to the right of it.\n\n4. **Count the non-mauve things to the right of the yellow thing:**\n   - As there are no items to the right of the yellow pair of sunglasses, the count of non-mauve things to the right of the yellow thing is zero.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the number of non-mauve things to the right of the yellow thing is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
