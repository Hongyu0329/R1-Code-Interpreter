    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the color of the object that is furthest from the grey pen. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Objects and their colors:**\n   - Blue envelope\n   - Orange mug\n   - Grey pen\n\n2. **Arrangement:**\n   - These objects are arranged in a row.\n\n3. **Objective:**\n   - Identify the color of the object that is furthest from the grey pen.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Identify the grey object:** The grey object is the pen.\n\n- **Determine the positions:**\n  - Since the objects are in a row, we can assume a linear arrangement.\n  - Possible arrangements could be:\n    1. Blue envelope, Orange mug, Grey pen\n    2. Blue envelope, Grey pen, Orange mug\n    3. Orange mug, Blue envelope, Grey pen\n    4. Orange mug, Grey pen, Blue envelope\n    5. Grey pen, Blue envelope, Orange mug\n    6. Grey pen, Orange mug, Blue envelope\n\n- **Evaluate each arrangement to find the furthest object from the grey pen:**\n  - In arrangement 1, the blue envelope is furthest from the grey pen.\n  - In arrangement 2, the orange mug is furthest from the grey pen.\n  - In arrangement 3, the orange mug is furthest from the grey pen.\n  - In arrangement 4, the blue envelope is furthest from the grey pen.\n  - In arrangement 5, the orange mug is furthest from the grey pen.\n  - In arrangement 6, the blue envelope is furthest from the grey pen.\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  - In half of the possible arrangements (1, 4, 6), the blue envelope is furthest from the grey pen.\n  - In the other half (2, 3, 5), the orange mug is furthest from the grey pen.\n\n- **Determine the most likely arrangement:**\n  - Without additional information, we assume a typical left-to-right arrangement.\n  - The first arrangement (Blue envelope, Orange mug, Grey pen) is a common left-to-right order.\n  - In this arrangement, the blue envelope is furthest from the grey pen.\n\n- **Check the options:**\n  - The options provided are colors, and we need to match the color of the furthest object.\n  - The blue envelope corresponds to option (E) blue.\n\nTherefore, the color of the thing furthest from the grey thing is blue.\n\n<<<blue>>>"
