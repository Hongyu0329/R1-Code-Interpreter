    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the objects on the floor and determine how many turquoise objects remain after removing all the notebooks.\n\n1. **Identify the objects on the floor:**\n   - Three yellow paperclips\n   - Three yellow notebooks\n   - Three blue paperclips\n   - One blue notebook\n\n2. **Remove all the notebooks:**\n   - We have three yellow notebooks and one blue notebook. Removing these, we are left with:\n     - Three yellow paperclips\n     - Three blue paperclips\n\n3. **Determine the number of turquoise objects:**\n   - The problem asks for the number of turquoise objects remaining. However, there is no mention of any turquoise objects in the list of items on the floor. The objects mentioned are yellow and blue, but none are turquoise.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no turquoise objects mentioned initially, and none can be inferred from the given information, the number of turquoise objects remaining on the floor is zero.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<zero>>>"
