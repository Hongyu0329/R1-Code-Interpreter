    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the objects on the nightstand and determine which ones are neither yellow nor green. Let's go through the objects one by one:\n\n1. **Black necklace**: This object is black, so it is neither yellow nor green.\n2. **Green fidget spinner**: This object is green, so it is not counted.\n3. **Blue keychain**: This object is blue, so it is neither yellow nor green.\n4. **Yellow sheet of paper**: This object is yellow, so it is not counted.\n5. **Red stress ball**: This object is red, so it is neither yellow nor green.\n\nNow, let's count the objects that are neither yellow nor green:\n\n- Black necklace\n- Blue keychain\n- Red stress ball\n\nThere are three objects that are neither yellow nor green.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) three.\n\n<<<three>>>"
