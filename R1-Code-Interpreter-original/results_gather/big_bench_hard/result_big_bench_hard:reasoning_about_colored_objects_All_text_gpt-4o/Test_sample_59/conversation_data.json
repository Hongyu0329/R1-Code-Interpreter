The objects are arranged in the following order:\n   - A gold pencil\n   - A red jug\n   - A grey bracelet\n   - A mauve dog leash\n\n2. We need to identify the object that is directly to the left of the grey bracelet.\n\n3. According to the arrangement, the object directly to the left of the grey bracelet is the red jug.\n\n4.
