    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives, which is generally as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"wool repulsive prismlike American chair\"\n- \"wool\" is a material\n- \"repulsive\" is a quality or opinion\n- \"prismlike\" is a shape\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective (nationality)\n\nAccording to the standard order:\n- Quality or opinion (\"repulsive\") should come first.\n- Shape (\"prismlike\") should follow the quality.\n- Proper adjective (\"American\") should come after shape.\n- Material (\"wool\") should come last before the noun.\n\nOption (A) does not follow the correct order because \"wool\" (material) is placed first, and \"repulsive\" (quality) is not in the correct position.\n\nOption (B): \"repulsive prismlike American wool chair\"\n- \"repulsive\" is a quality or opinion\n- \"prismlike\" is a shape\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective (nationality)\n- \"wool\" is a material\n\nAccording to the standard order:\n- Quality or opinion (\"repulsive\") comes first.\n- Shape (\"prismlike\") follows the quality.\n- Proper adjective (\"American\") comes after shape.\n- Material (\"wool\") comes last before the noun.\n\nOption (B) follows the correct order of adjectives.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) repulsive prismlike American wool chair"
