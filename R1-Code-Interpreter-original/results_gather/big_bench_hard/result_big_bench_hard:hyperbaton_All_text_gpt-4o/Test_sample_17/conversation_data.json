    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"lovely midsize green Filipino sock\"\n- \"lovely\" is an opinion adjective.\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"green\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Filipino\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nAccording to the adjective order, the sequence should be: opinion, size, color, proper adjective. Option (A) follows this order correctly.\n\nOption (B): \"Filipino midsize lovely green sock\"\n- \"Filipino\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"lovely\" is an opinion adjective.\n- \"green\" is a color adjective.\n\nIn this option, the proper adjective comes first, which is not the correct order according to the typical sequence. The opinion adjective \"lovely\" should come before the size adjective \"midsize,\" and the proper adjective \"Filipino\" should come after the color adjective \"green.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence with the proper adjective order is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
