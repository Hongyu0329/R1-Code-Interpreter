    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the conventional order of adjectives. The typical order is as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nOption (A): \"Russian steel awful chair\"\n- \"Russian\" is a proper adjective indicating nationality.\n- \"steel\" is a material.\n- \"awful\" is an opinion or quality.\n\nAccording to the conventional order, the opinion or quality adjective should come before the proper adjective and material. Therefore, \"awful\" should precede \"Russian\" and \"steel.\"\n\nOption (B): \"awful Russian steel chair\"\n- \"awful\" is an opinion or quality.\n- \"Russian\" is a proper adjective indicating nationality.\n- \"steel\" is a material.\n\nThis order follows the conventional adjective order: opinion/quality (\"awful\") comes before the proper adjective (\"Russian\") and material (\"steel\").\n\nTherefore, option (B) follows the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) awful Russian steel chair"
