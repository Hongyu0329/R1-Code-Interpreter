    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"brand-new pink ridiculous wood massive baby\"\n- \"brand-new\" is an age descriptor.\n- \"pink\" is a color descriptor.\n- \"ridiculous\" is a quality or opinion descriptor.\n- \"wood\" is a material descriptor.\n- \"massive\" is a size descriptor.\n\nThe order in option (A) is: age, color, quality, material, size. This does not follow the typical adjective order.\n\nOption (B): \"ridiculous massive brand-new pink wood baby\"\n- \"ridiculous\" is a quality or opinion descriptor.\n- \"massive\" is a size descriptor.\n- \"brand-new\" is an age descriptor.\n- \"pink\" is a color descriptor.\n- \"wood\" is a material descriptor.\n\nThe order in option (B) is: quality, size, age, color, material. This follows the typical adjective order.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) ridiculous massive brand-new pink wood baby"
