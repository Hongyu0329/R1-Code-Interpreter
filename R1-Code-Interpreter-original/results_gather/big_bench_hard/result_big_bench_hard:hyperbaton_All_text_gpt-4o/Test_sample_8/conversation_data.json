Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\n**Option (A):** \"medium-size archaic prismlike purple American car\"\n- \"medium-size\" refers to size.\n- \"archaic\" refers to age.\n- \"prismlike\" refers to shape.\n- \"purple\" refers to color.\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nOrder in Option (A): Size, Age, Shape, Color, Proper adjective.\n\n**Option (B):** \"archaic purple prismlike American medium-size car\"\n- \"archaic\" refers to age.\n- \"purple\" refers to color.\n- \"prismlike\" refers to shape.\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"medium-size\" refers to size.\n\nOrder in Option (B): Age, Color, Shape, Proper adjective, Size.\n\nNow, let's compare these orders with the typical sequence:\n\n- The correct order should be: Size, Age, Shape, Color, Proper adjective.\n- Option (A) follows this order correctly.\n- Option (B) does not follow the correct order.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> Option (A) medium-size archaic prismlike purple American car"
