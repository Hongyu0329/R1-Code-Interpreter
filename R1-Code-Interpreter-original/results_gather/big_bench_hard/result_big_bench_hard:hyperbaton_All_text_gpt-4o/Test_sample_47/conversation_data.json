    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"tiny whittling grey brand-new Indian triangular dog\"\n- \"tiny\" is a size adjective.\n- \"whittling\" is not a standard adjective; it seems to be a verb form, which is unusual in this context.\n- \"grey\" is a color adjective.\n- \"brand-new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"Indian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"triangular\" is a shape adjective.\n\nThe order in (A) is: size, verb form (unusual), color, age, nationality, shape. This does not follow the standard adjective order.\n\nOption (B): \"tiny brand-new triangular grey Indian whittling dog\"\n- \"tiny\" is a size adjective.\n- \"brand-new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"triangular\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"grey\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Indian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"whittling\" is again a verb form, which is unusual.\n\nThe order in (B) is: size, age, shape, color, nationality, verb form (unusual). This follows the standard adjective order more closely, except for the unusual use of \"whittling.\"\n\nConsidering the standard adjective order and the unusual use of \"whittling,\" option (B) is closer to the correct order.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) tiny brand-new triangular grey Indian whittling dog"
