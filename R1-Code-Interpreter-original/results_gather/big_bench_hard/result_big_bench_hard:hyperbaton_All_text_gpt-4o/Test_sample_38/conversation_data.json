Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\n**Option (A):** \"midsize whittling gray nice baby\"\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"whittling\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"gray\" is a color adjective.\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n\nThe order in this sentence is: size, purpose, color, quality. This does not follow the typical adjective order.\n\n**Option (B):** \"nice midsize gray whittling baby\"\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"gray\" is a color adjective.\n- \"whittling\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nThe order in this sentence is: quality, size, color, purpose.
