    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives, which is generally as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"triangular yellow old awful motorcycle\"\n- Shape: triangular\n- Color: yellow\n- Age: old\n- Quality or opinion: awful\n\nThe order in this sentence is Shape, Color, Age, Quality, which does not follow the standard order. The correct order should be Quality, Age, Shape, Color.\n\nOption (B): \"awful old triangular yellow motorcycle\"\n- Quality or opinion: awful\n- Age: old\n- Shape: triangular\n- Color: yellow\n\nThe order in this sentence is Quality, Age, Shape, Color, which follows the standard order of adjectives.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
