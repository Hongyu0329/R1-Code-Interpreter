    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"nice midsize brand-new drinking surfboard\"\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"brand-new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"drinking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nOption (B): \"drinking nice brand-new midsize surfboard\"\n- \"drinking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"brand-new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n\nNow, let's compare the order of adjectives in each option with the typical sequence:\n\nFor option (A):\n- Quality (nice)\n- Size (midsize)\n- Age (brand-new)\n- Purpose (drinking)\n\nFor option (B):\n- Purpose (drinking)\n- Quality (nice)\n- Age (brand-new)\n- Size (midsize)\n\nOption (A) follows the correct order of adjectives: quality, size, age, and purpose. Option (B) does not follow the correct order because it starts with the purpose adjective, which should come last.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
