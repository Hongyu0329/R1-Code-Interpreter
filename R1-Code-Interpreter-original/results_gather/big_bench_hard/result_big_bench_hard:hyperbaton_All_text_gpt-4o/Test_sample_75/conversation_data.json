    "To determine which sentence has the correct adjective order, we need to understand the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nOption (A): \"snorkeling awful silver sweater\"\n- \"snorkeling\" is a purpose or qualifier\n- \"awful\" is a quality or opinion\n- \"silver\" is a color\n\nOption (B): \"awful silver snorkeling sweater\"\n- \"awful\" is a quality or opinion\n- \"silver\" is a color\n- \"snorkeling\" is a purpose or qualifier\n\nAccording to the standard order of adjectives, the correct sequence should be: quality/opinion, color, and then purpose/qualifier. \n\nTherefore, option (B) follows the correct order:\n1. Quality or opinion: \"awful\"\n2. Color: \"silver\"\n3. Purpose or qualifier: \"snorkeling\"\n\nOption (A) does not follow the correct order because it places the purpose/qualifier before the quality/opinion and color.\n\nThus, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) awful silver snorkeling sweater"
