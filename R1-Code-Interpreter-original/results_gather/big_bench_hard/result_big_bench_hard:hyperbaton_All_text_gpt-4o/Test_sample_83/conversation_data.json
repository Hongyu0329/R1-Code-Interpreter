    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\n**Option (A):** \"old-fashioned huge obnoxious prismlike smoking motorcycle\"\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age descriptor.\n- \"huge\" is a size descriptor.\n- \"obnoxious\" is a quality or opinion descriptor.\n- \"prismlike\" is a shape descriptor.\n- \"smoking\" is a purpose or qualifier descriptor.\n\n**Option (B):** \"obnoxious huge old-fashioned prismlike smoking motorcycle\"\n- \"obnoxious\" is a quality or opinion descriptor.\n- \"huge\" is a size descriptor.\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age descriptor.\n- \"prismlike\" is a shape descriptor.\n- \"smoking\" is a purpose or qualifier descriptor.\n\nNow, let's apply the typical adjective order to each option:\n\n1. **Option (A):** \n   - The order is: age (old-fashioned), size (huge), quality (obnoxious), shape (prismlike), purpose (smoking).\n   - This order does not follow the typical sequence because the quality (obnoxious) should come before size (huge) and age (old-fashioned).\n\n2. **Option (B):**\n   - The order is: quality (obnoxious), size (huge), age (old-fashioned), shape (prismlike), purpose (smoking).\n   - This order follows the typical sequence: quality, size, age, shape, purpose.\n\nTherefore, the correct adjective order is found in Option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) obnoxious huge old-fashioned prismlike smoking motorcycle"
