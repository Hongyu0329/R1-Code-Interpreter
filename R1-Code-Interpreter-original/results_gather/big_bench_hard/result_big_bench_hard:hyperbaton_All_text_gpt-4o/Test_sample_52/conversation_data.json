    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"enormous spherical Indian drinking sock\"\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"spherical\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Indian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"drinking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nAccording to the adjective order, size comes before shape, which comes before proper adjectives, and finally, the purpose or qualifier comes last. Therefore, this order is correct.\n\nOption (B): \"drinking enormous spherical Indian sock\"\n- \"drinking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"spherical\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Indian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nIn this option, the purpose or qualifier adjective \"drinking\" is placed first, which is incorrect according to the typical adjective order. The purpose or qualifier should come last.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence with the proper adjective order is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
