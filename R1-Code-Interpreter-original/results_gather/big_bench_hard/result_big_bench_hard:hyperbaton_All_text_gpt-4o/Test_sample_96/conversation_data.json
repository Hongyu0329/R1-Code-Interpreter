    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives, which is generally:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"archaic nice snorkeling rectangular grey baby\"\n- \"archaic\" (age)\n- \"nice\" (quality/opinion)\n- \"snorkeling\" (purpose/qualifier)\n- \"rectangular\" (shape)\n- \"grey\" (color)\n- \"baby\" (noun)\n\nThe order here is: age, quality, purpose, shape, color, noun. This does not follow the standard order.\n\nOption (B): \"nice archaic rectangular grey snorkeling baby\"\n- \"nice\" (quality/opinion)\n- \"archaic\" (age)\n- \"rectangular\" (shape)\n- \"grey\" (color)\n- \"snorkeling\" (purpose/qualifier)\n- \"baby\" (noun)\n\nThe order here is: quality, age, shape, color, purpose, noun.
