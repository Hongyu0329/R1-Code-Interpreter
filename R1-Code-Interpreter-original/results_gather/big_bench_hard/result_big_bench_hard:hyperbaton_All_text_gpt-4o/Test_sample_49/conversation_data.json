    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"enormous new triangular Nigerian lead cat\"\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"triangular\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Nigerian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"lead\" is a material adjective.\n\nOrder in (A): Size, Age, Shape, Proper adjective, Material\n\nOption (B): \"enormous Nigerian triangular new lead cat\"\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"Nigerian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"triangular\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"lead\" is a material adjective.\n\nOrder in (B): Size, Proper adjective, Shape, Age, Material\n\nNow, let's compare these orders with the typical sequence:\n\n- The correct order should be: Size, Age, Shape, Proper adjective, Material\n\nOption (A) follows this order correctly:\n- Size: \"enormous\"\n- Age: \"new\"\n- Shape: \"triangular\"\n- Proper adjective: \"Nigerian\"\n- Material: \"lead\"\n\nOption (B) does not follow the correct order because it places the proper adjective before the age and shape adjectives.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) enormous new triangular Nigerian lead cat"
