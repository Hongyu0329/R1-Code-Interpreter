    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"Indonesian triangular obnoxious gold red shoe\"\n- \"Indonesian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"Triangular\" is a shape.\n- \"Obnoxious\" is a quality or opinion.\n- \"Gold\" is a material.\n- \"Red\" is a color.\n\nThe order in option (A) is: Proper adjective, Shape, Quality, Material, Color. This does not follow the typical adjective order.\n\nOption (B): \"obnoxious triangular red Indonesian gold shoe\"\n- \"Obnoxious\" is a quality or opinion.\n- \"Triangular\" is a shape.\n- \"Red\" is a color.\n- \"Indonesian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"Gold\" is a material.\n\nThe order in option (B) is: Quality, Shape, Color, Proper adjective, Material. This follows the typical adjective order more closely.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) obnoxious triangular red Indonesian gold shoe"
