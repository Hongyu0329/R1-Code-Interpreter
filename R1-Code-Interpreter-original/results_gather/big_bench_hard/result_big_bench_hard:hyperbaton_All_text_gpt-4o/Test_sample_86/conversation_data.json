    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\n**Option (A):** \"enormous pyramidal white Indonesian glass smoking cat\"\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"pyramidal\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"white\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Indonesian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"glass\" is a material adjective.\n- \"smoking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nOrder in (A): Size, Shape, Color, Proper adjective, Material, Purpose\n\n**Option (B):** \"pyramidal Indonesian enormous smoking white glass cat\"\n- \"pyramidal\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Indonesian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"smoking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"white\" is a color adjective.\n- \"glass\" is a material adjective.\n\nOrder in (B): Shape, Proper adjective, Size, Purpose, Color, Material\n\nNow, let's compare these orders to the typical sequence:\n\n- The correct order should be: Size, Shape, Color, Proper adjective, Material, Purpose\n\nOption (A) follows this order correctly:\n- Size: \"enormous\"\n- Shape: \"pyramidal\"\n- Color: \"white\"\n- Proper adjective: \"Indonesian\"\n- Material: \"glass\"\n- Purpose: \"smoking\"\n\nOption (B) does not follow the correct order, as it places \"shape\" before \"size\" and \"purpose\" before \"color.\"\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
