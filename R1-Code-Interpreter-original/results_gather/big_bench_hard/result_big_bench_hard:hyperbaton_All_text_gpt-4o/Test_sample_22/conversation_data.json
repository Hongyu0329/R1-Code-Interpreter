Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"new white lead walking surfboard\"\n- \"new\" is an adjective of age.\n- \"white\" is an adjective of color.\n- \"lead\" is a material adjective.\n- \"walking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nAccording to the adjective order, the sequence should be: age, color, material, purpose. This matches the order in option (A).\n\nOption (B): \"walking lead new white surfboard\"\n- \"walking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"lead\" is a material adjective.\n- \"new\" is an adjective of age.\n- \"white\" is an adjective of color.\n\nThe order in option (B) is purpose, material, age, color, which does not follow the typical adjective order.\n\nTherefore, option (A) follows the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
