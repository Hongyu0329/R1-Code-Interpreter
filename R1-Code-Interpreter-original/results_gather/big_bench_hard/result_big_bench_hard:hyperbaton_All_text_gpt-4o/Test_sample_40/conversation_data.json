    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives, which is generally as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"midsize old pyramidal American monkey\"\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"old\" is an age adjective.\n- \"pyramidal\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nAccording to the standard order:\n- Size (\"midsize\") should come before age (\"old\").\n- Age (\"old\") should come before shape (\"pyramidal\").\n- Shape (\"pyramidal\") should come before the proper adjective (\"American\").\n\nOption (A) follows the correct order: size, age, shape, proper adjective.\n\nOption (B): \"American old midsize pyramidal monkey\"\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"old\" is an age adjective.\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"pyramidal\" is a shape adjective.\n\nAccording to the standard order:\n- The proper adjective (\"American\") should come last, after size, age, and shape.\n- Size (\"midsize\") should come before age (\"old\").\n- Age (\"old\") should come before shape (\"pyramidal\").\n\nOption (B) does not follow the correct order because the proper adjective \"American\" is placed first, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) midsize old pyramidal American monkey"
