    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives, which is generally as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\n**Option (A):** \"terrible archaic pyramidal white Nigerian match\"\n- \"terrible\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"archaic\" is an age adjective.\n- \"pyramidal\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"white\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Nigerian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"match\" is the noun.\n\nOrder in Option (A): Quality/Opinion, Age, Shape, Color, Proper Adjective, Noun.\n\n**Option (B):** \"pyramidal Nigerian terrible white archaic match\"\n- \"pyramidal\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Nigerian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"terrible\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"white\" is a color adjective.\n- \"archaic\" is an age adjective.\n- \"match\" is the noun.\n\nOrder in Option (B): Shape, Proper Adjective, Quality/Opinion, Color, Age, Noun.\n\nNow, let's compare these orders to the standard order:\n\n- The correct order should be: Quality/Opinion, Age, Shape, Color, Proper Adjective, Noun.\n\nOption (A) follows the correct order: Quality/Opinion (\"terrible\"), Age (\"archaic\"), Shape (\"pyramidal\"), Color (\"white\"), Proper Adjective (\"Nigerian\"), Noun (\"match\").\n\nOption (B) does not follow the correct order, as it starts with Shape and places Quality/Opinion and Age out of order.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) terrible archaic pyramidal white Nigerian match"
