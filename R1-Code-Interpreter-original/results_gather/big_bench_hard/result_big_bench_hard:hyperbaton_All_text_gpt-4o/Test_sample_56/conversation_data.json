    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"cloth hiking huge old-fashioned shoe\"\n- \"cloth\" is a material\n- \"hiking\" is a purpose or qualifier\n- \"huge\" is a size\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age\n\nAccording to the adjective order, the correct sequence should be: size, age, material, purpose. Therefore, the order in option (A) is incorrect.\n\nOption (B): \"huge old-fashioned cloth hiking shoe\"\n- \"huge\" is a size\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age\n- \"cloth\" is a material\n- \"hiking\" is a purpose or qualifier\n\nThis order follows the correct sequence: size, age, material, purpose.
