Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption (A): \"mysterious medium-size red Indonesian monkey\"\n- \"mysterious\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"medium-size\" is a size adjective.\n- \"red\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Indonesian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nAccording to the typical order, the sequence should be: quality/opinion, size, color, proper adjective. Option (A) follows this order correctly.\n\nOption (B): \"mysterious Indonesian medium-size red monkey\"\n- \"mysterious\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"Indonesian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"medium-size\" is a size adjective.\n- \"red\" is a color adjective.\n\nIn this option, the proper adjective \"Indonesian\" comes before the size and color adjectives, which does not follow the typical order.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence with the proper adjective order is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
