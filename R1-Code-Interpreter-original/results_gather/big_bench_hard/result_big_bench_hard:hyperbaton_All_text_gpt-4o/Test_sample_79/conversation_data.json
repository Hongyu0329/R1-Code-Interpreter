Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"midsize purple Russian gold snorkeling sock\"\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"purple\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Russian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"gold\" is a material adjective.\n- \"snorkeling\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nOrder in (A): Size, Color, Proper adjective, Material, Purpose\n\nOption (B): \"gold Russian midsize purple snorkeling sock\"\n- \"gold\" is a material adjective.\n- \"Russian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"midsize\" is a size adjective.\n- \"purple\" is a color adjective.\n- \"snorkeling\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nOrder in (B): Material, Proper adjective, Size, Color, Purpose\n\nNow, let's compare these orders to the typical sequence:\n\n- The correct order should be: Size, Color, Proper adjective, Material, Purpose\n\nOption (A) follows the correct order: Size (midsize), Color (purple), Proper adjective (Russian), Material (gold), Purpose (snorkeling).\n\nOption (B) does not follow the correct order, as it starts with Material and Proper adjective before Size and Color.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> Option (A) midsize purple Russian gold snorkeling sock"
