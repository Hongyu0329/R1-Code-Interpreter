    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\n**Option (A):** silver new repulsive exercise green Pakistani computer\n\n- \"repulsive\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"green\" is a color adjective.\n- \"Pakistani\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"silver\" is a color adjective.\n- \"exercise\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nThe order in option (A) is: color, age, quality, purpose, color, proper adjective.
