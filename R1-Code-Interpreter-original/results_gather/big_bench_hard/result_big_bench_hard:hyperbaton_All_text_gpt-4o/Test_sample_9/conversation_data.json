Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\nOption (A): \"enormous rectangular blue dog\"\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"rectangular\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"blue\" is a color adjective.\n\nAccording to the standard order, size should come before shape, and shape should come before color. Therefore, the order in option (A) is correct.\n\nOption (B): \"enormous blue rectangular dog\"\n- \"enormous\" is a size adjective.\n- \"blue\" is a color adjective.\n- \"rectangular\" is a shape adjective.\n\nIn this option, the color adjective \"blue\" comes before the shape adjective \"rectangular,\" which does not follow the standard order.
