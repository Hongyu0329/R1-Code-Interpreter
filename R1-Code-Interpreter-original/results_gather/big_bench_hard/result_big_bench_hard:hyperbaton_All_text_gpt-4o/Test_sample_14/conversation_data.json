Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\nOption (A): \"nice American computer\"\n- \"nice\" is an adjective of quality or opinion.\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective indicating nationality.\n- \"computer\" is the noun.\n\nAccording to the adjective order, the quality or opinion adjective (\"nice\") should come before the proper adjective (\"American\"). Therefore, this order is correct.\n\nOption (B): \"American nice computer\"\n- \"American\" is a proper adjective indicating nationality.\n- \"nice\" is an adjective of quality or opinion.\n- \"computer\" is the noun.\n\nIn this option, the proper adjective (\"American\") comes before the quality or opinion adjective (\"nice\"), which does not follow the typical adjective order in English.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (A) follows the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
