    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"square Congolese driving old-fashioned dog\"\n- \"square\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Congolese\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"driving\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age adjective.\n\nThe order in option (A) is: shape, nationality, purpose, age. This does not follow the typical adjective order.\n\nOption (B): \"old-fashioned square Congolese driving dog\"\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age adjective.\n- \"square\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Congolese\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"driving\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nThe order in option (B) is: age, shape, nationality, purpose. This follows the typical adjective order more closely.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) old-fashioned square Congolese driving dog"
