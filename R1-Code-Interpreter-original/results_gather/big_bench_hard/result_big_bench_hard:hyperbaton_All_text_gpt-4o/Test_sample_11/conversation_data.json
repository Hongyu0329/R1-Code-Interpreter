    "To determine which sentence has the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option (A):** \"terrible tiny new square Egyptian typing sock\"\n- \"terrible\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"tiny\" is a size adjective.\n- \"new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"square\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Egyptian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"typing\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\n**Option (B):** \"new typing square Egyptian tiny terrible sock\"\n- \"new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"typing\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"square\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"Egyptian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"tiny\" is a size adjective.\n- \"terrible\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n\nNow, let's compare each option to the standard order:\n\n- In Option (A), the order is: quality, size, age, shape, proper adjective, purpose. This mostly follows the standard order, except that the purpose adjective \"typing\" should come before the noun \"sock.\"\n- In Option (B), the order is: age, purpose, shape, proper adjective, size, quality. This does not follow the standard order, as the purpose adjective \"typing\" is placed before the shape and proper adjective, and the quality adjective \"terrible\" is placed last.\n\nTherefore, Option (A) is closer to the correct adjective order, although it still has a minor issue with the placement of the purpose adjective.\n\nThe correct answer is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
