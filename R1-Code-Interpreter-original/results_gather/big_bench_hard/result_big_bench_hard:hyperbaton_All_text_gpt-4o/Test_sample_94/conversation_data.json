Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\nOption (A): \"driving pyramidal small chair\"\n- \"driving\" is a purpose or qualifier\n- \"pyramidal\" is a shape\n- \"small\" is a size\n\nAccording to the typical adjective order, size should come before shape, and purpose or qualifier should come last. Therefore, the order in option (A) is incorrect.\n\nOption (B): \"small pyramidal driving chair\"\n- \"small\" is a size\n- \"pyramidal\" is a shape\n- \"driving\" is a purpose or qualifier\n\nIn this option, the adjectives are in the correct order: size, shape, and then purpose or qualifier.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) small pyramidal driving chair"
