    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives, which is generally:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\n**Option (A):** \"repulsive large new rectangular red rubber whittling sweater\"\n\n- \"repulsive\" is an opinion adjective.\n- \"large\" is a size adjective.\n- \"new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"rectangular\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"red\" is a color adjective.\n- \"rubber\" is a material adjective.\n- \"whittling\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nOrder in Option (A): Opinion, Size, Age, Shape, Color, Material, Purpose\n\n**Option (B):** \"red rubber repulsive new rectangular whittling large sweater\"\n\n- \"red\" is a color adjective.\n- \"rubber\" is a material adjective.\n- \"repulsive\" is an opinion adjective.\n- \"new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"rectangular\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"whittling\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"large\" is a size adjective.\n\nOrder in Option (B): Color, Material, Opinion, Age, Shape, Purpose, Size\n\nNow, let's compare these with the standard order:\n\n- Option (A) follows the correct order: Opinion, Size, Age, Shape, Color, Material, Purpose.\n- Option (B) does not follow the correct order.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
