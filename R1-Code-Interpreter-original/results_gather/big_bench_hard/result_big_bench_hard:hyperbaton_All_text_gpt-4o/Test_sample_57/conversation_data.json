    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives. The general order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"exercise old-fashioned steel midsize Congolese match\"\n- \"exercise\" is a purpose or qualifier\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age descriptor\n- \"steel\" is a material\n- \"midsize\" is a size descriptor\n- \"Congolese\" is a proper adjective (nationality)\n- \"match\" is the noun\n\nThe order in option (A) does not follow the typical sequence. The purpose or qualifier \"exercise\" should be at the end, just before the noun. The size \"midsize\" should come before the age \"old-fashioned,\" and the proper adjective \"Congolese\" should come before the material \"steel.\"\n\nOption (B): \"midsize old-fashioned Congolese steel exercise match\"\n- \"midsize\" is a size descriptor\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age descriptor\n- \"Congolese\" is a proper adjective (nationality)\n- \"steel\" is a material\n- \"exercise\" is a purpose or qualifier\n- \"match\" is the noun\n\nThe order in option (B) follows the typical sequence:\n- Size (\"midsize\") comes before age (\"old-fashioned\").\n- Proper adjective (\"Congolese\") comes before material (\"steel\").\n- Purpose or qualifier (\"exercise\") comes just before the noun (\"match\").\n\nTherefore, option (B) has the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) midsize old-fashioned Congolese steel exercise match"
