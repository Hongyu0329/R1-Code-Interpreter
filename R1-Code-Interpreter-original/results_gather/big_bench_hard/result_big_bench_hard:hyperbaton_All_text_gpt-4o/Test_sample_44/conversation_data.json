    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"walking black medium-size rectangular wonderful car\"\n- \"walking\" is not a typical adjective for a car, but if we consider it as a purpose or qualifier, it would come last.\n- \"black\" is a color.\n- \"medium-size\" refers to size.\n- \"rectangular\" refers to shape.\n- \"wonderful\" is an opinion or quality.\n\nThe order in (A) is: purpose/qualifier, color, size, shape, opinion. This does not follow the typical adjective order.\n\nOption (B): \"wonderful medium-size rectangular black walking car\"\n- \"wonderful\" is an opinion or quality.\n- \"medium-size\" refers to size.\n- \"rectangular\" refers to shape.\n- \"black\" is a color.\n- \"walking\" is a purpose or qualifier.\n\nThe order in (B) is: opinion, size, shape, color, purpose/qualifier. This follows the typical adjective order.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) wonderful medium-size rectangular black walking car"
