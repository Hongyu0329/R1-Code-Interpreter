Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option (A): Iranian nice lead old-fashioned monkey**\n- \"Iranian\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"Nice\" is a quality or opinion.\n- \"Lead\" is a material.\n- \"Old-fashioned\" is an age descriptor.\n\nAccording to the typical adjective order, the sequence should be: quality/opinion, age, proper adjective, material.
