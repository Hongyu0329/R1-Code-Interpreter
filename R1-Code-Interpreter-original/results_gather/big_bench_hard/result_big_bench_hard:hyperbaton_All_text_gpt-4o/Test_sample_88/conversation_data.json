    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is generally as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"medium-size ancient rectangular Congolese whittling ship\"\n- \"medium-size\" refers to the size of the ship.\n- \"ancient\" refers to the age of the ship.\n- \"rectangular\" refers to the shape of the ship.\n- \"Congolese\" is a proper adjective indicating the origin of the ship.\n- \"whittling\" is a purpose or qualifier describing the function of the ship.\n\nOrder in Option (A): Size, Age, Shape, Proper adjective, Purpose\n\nOption (B): \"medium-size whittling rectangular ancient Congolese ship\"\n- \"medium-size\" refers to the size of the ship.\n- \"whittling\" is a purpose or qualifier describing the function of the ship.\n- \"rectangular\" refers to the shape of the ship.\n- \"ancient\" refers to the age of the ship.\n- \"Congolese\" is a proper adjective indicating the origin of the ship.\n\nOrder in Option (B): Size, Purpose, Shape, Age, Proper adjective\n\nComparing both options to the typical adjective order:\n- Option (A) follows the correct order: Size, Age, Shape, Proper adjective, Purpose.\n- Option (B) does not follow the correct order, as the purpose adjective \"whittling\" is placed before the shape and age adjectives.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is Option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) medium-size ancient rectangular Congolese whittling ship"
