    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"new\" and \"green.\"\n\n- \"New\" is an adjective that describes age.\n- \"Green\" is an adjective that describes color.\n\nAccording to the standard order of adjectives, age comes before color. Therefore, the correct order should be:\n\n1. Age: new\n2. Color: green\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) green new chair\n- \"Green\" (color) comes before \"new\" (age), which does not follow the standard order.\n\n(B) new green chair\n- \"New\" (age) comes before \"green\" (color), which follows the standard order.\n\nTherefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> B"
