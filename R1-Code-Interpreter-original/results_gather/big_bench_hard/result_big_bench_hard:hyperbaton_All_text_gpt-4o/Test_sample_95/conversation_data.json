    "To determine which sentence has the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option (A):** \"nice little brand-new spherical purple lead chair\"\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"little\" is a size adjective.\n- \"brand-new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"spherical\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"purple\" is a color adjective.\n- \"lead\" is a material adjective.\n\nThe order in option (A) follows the standard adjective order: quality (nice), size (little), age (brand-new), shape (spherical), color (purple), material (lead).\n\n**Option (B):** \"little brand-new lead nice spherical purple chair\"\n- \"little\" is a size adjective.\n- \"brand-new\" is an age adjective.\n- \"lead\" is a material adjective.\n- \"nice\" is a quality or opinion adjective.\n- \"spherical\" is a shape adjective.\n- \"purple\" is a color adjective.\n\nThe order in option (B) does not follow the standard adjective order. The quality adjective \"nice\" should come before the size adjective \"little,\" and the material adjective \"lead\" should come after the color adjective \"purple.\"\n\nTherefore, option (A) has the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
