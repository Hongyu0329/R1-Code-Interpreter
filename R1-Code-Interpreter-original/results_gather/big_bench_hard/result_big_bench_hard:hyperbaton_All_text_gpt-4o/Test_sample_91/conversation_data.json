    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we need to follow the typical sequence of adjectives, which is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this order:\n\nOption (A): \"obnoxious big prismlike orange Filipino glass knife\"\n- \"obnoxious\" is an opinion or quality.\n- \"big\" is a size.\n- \"prismlike\" is a shape.\n- \"orange\" is a color.\n- \"Filipino\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"glass\" is a material.\n- \"knife\" is the noun.\n\nOption (B): \"obnoxious big prismlike Filipino orange glass knife\"\n- \"obnoxious\" is an opinion or quality.\n- \"big\" is a size.\n- \"prismlike\" is a shape.\n- \"Filipino\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"orange\" is a color.\n- \"glass\" is a material.\n- \"knife\" is the noun.\n\nNow, let's compare both options to the typical adjective order:\n\n- Both options start with \"obnoxious\" (quality/opinion) and \"big\" (size), which is correct.\n- Both options have \"prismlike\" (shape) following \"big,\" which is also correct.\n- The difference lies in the order of \"Filipino\" (proper adjective) and \"orange\" (color).\n\nAccording to the typical order, color should come before the proper adjective. Therefore, the correct order should be:\n\n1. Quality/opinion: \"obnoxious\"\n2. Size: \"big\"\n3. Shape: \"prismlike\"\n4. Color: \"orange\"\n5. Proper adjective: \"Filipino\"\n6. Material: \"glass\"\n7. Noun: \"knife\"\n\nThus, option (A) follows the correct adjective order.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
