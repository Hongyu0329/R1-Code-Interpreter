    "To determine which sentence has the correct adjective order, we need to understand the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nOption (A): \"drinking old monkey\"\n- \"drinking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n- \"old\" is an age adjective.\n\nOption (B): \"old drinking monkey\"\n- \"old\" is an age adjective.\n- \"drinking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective.\n\nAccording to the standard order of adjectives, the age adjective should come before the purpose or qualifier adjective. Therefore, the correct order is \"old drinking monkey.\"\n\nThus, the correct sentence is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) old drinking monkey"
