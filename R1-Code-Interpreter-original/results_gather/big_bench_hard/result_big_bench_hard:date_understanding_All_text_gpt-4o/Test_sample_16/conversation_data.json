    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current date based on the information given:\n\n1. **Understand the statement**: The problem states that May 6, 1992, is like yesterday to Jane, but it is actually ten years ago. This implies that the current date is ten years after May 6, 1992.\n\n2. **Calculate the current date**: \n   - Start with the date May 6, 1992.\n   - Add ten years to this date to find the current date.\n   - Adding ten years to May 6, 1992, results in May 6, 2002.\n\n3. **Match the calculated date with the options**:\n   - We need to find which option matches the date May 6, 2002.\n   - Option (E) is 05/06/2002, which matches the calculated date.\n\n4. **Verify the logic**: \n   - The problem states that May 6, 1992, is ten years ago, which means the current year should be 2002.\n   - The month and day remain the same, as we are only adding years.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The correct date based on the problem statement is May 6, 2002.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
