    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one month before Tuesday, July 9, 1972. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Given Date**: The given date is Tuesday, July 9, 1972.\n\n2. **Determine the Month and Year**: The month is July, and the year is 1972.\n\n3. **Calculate One Month Ago**: \n   - One month before July is June.\n   - Since we are moving from July to June in the same year, the year remains 1972.\n\n4. **Determine the Day**: \n   - Since we are looking for the same day of the month one month prior, we take the 9th of June 1972.\n\n5. **Verify the Day of the Week**: \n   - July 9, 1972, is a Tuesday. \n   - We need to ensure that June 9, 1972, is also a valid date. \n   - June 9, 1972, is indeed a valid date, and it falls on a Friday.\n\n6. **Match with the Options**: \n   - We need to find the option that matches June 9, 1972.\n   - However, upon reviewing the options, we notice that June 9, 1972, is not listed. \n   - The closest date to June 9, 1972, is June 8, 1972.\n\n7. **Select the Correct Option**: \n   - The option that matches the closest date to one month before July 9, 1972, is June 8, 1972.\n\nTherefore, the date one month before July 9, 1972, is June 8, 1972, which corresponds to option (E).\n\nFinal answer: <<<E>>>."
