    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date today given that the day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the given information**: The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. This means that two days ago, the date was November 23, 1933.\n\n2. **Calculate yesterday's date**: If two days ago was 11/23/1933, then yesterday would be one day after that. Therefore, yesterday's date was 11/24/1933.\n\n3. **Calculate today's date**: If yesterday was 11/24/1933, then today is one day after that. Therefore, today's date is 11/25/1933.\n\n4. **Match with the options**: We need to find the option that matches the calculated date of 11/25/1933.\n\n5. **Review the options**:\n   - (A) 08/29/1933\n   - (B) 01/04/1934\n   - (C) 11/25/1967\n   - (D) 11/25/1933\n   - (E) 11/04/1933\n   - (F) 12/09/1933\n\n6. **Select the correct option**: The date we calculated, 11/25/1933, matches option (D).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
