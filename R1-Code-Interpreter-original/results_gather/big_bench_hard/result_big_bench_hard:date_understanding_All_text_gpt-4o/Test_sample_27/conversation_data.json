    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week ago from today, given that 176 days have passed since Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Date 176 Days After March 20, 2020:**\n   - March 20, 2020, is the starting point.\n   - March has 31 days, so from March 20 to March 31, there are 11 days.\n   - April has 30 days.\n   - May has 31 days.\n   - June has 30 days.\n   - July has 31 days.\n   - August has 31 days.\n\n   Let's calculate the cumulative days:\n   - March 20 to March 31: 11 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 31 days\n   - August: 31 days\n\n   Total days from March 20 to August 31 = 11 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 164 days.\n\n   Since 176 days have passed, we need to add 12 more days to August 31, 2020.\n\n   - Adding 12 days to August 31, 2020, brings us to September 12, 2020.\n\n2. **Determine the Date One Week Ago from September 12, 2020:**\n   - One week ago from September 12, 2020, is September 5, 2020.\n\n3. **Match the Date with the Given Options:**\n   - The date one week ago from today (September 12, 2020) is September 5, 2020.\n   - The option that matches this date is (B) 09/05/2020.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
