    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given date format and determine the correct date for tomorrow in the specified format.\n\n1. **Understand the Date Format:**\n   - In the UK, the date format is typically DD/MM/YYYY. This means the day comes first, followed by the month, and then the year.\n   - The given date is 02/01/1987. In the UK format, this translates to the 2nd of January, 1987.\n\n2. **Determine the Date for Tomorrow:**\n   - Since today is the 2nd of January, 1987, tomorrow will be the 3rd of January, 1987.\n\n3. **Convert to the Required Date Format:**\n   - The question asks for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, which is the format commonly used in the United States.\n   - Therefore, the 3rd of January, 1987, should be written as 01/03/1987 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n4. **Match with the Given Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches 01/03/1987.\n   - Option (B) is 01/03/1987, which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/03/1987.\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
