    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of the first Monday in 2019 and then find the date exactly one year before that.\n\n1. **Identify the first day of 2019:**\n   - We are given that the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday.\n\n2. **Determine the first Monday of 2019:**\n   - Since January 1, 2019, is a Tuesday, the days of the week for the first few days of January 2019 are as follows:\n     - January 1, 2019: Tuesday\n     - January 2, 2019: Wednesday\n     - January 3, 2019: Thursday\n     - January 4, 2019: Friday\n     - January 5, 2019: Saturday\n     - January 6, 2019: Sunday\n     - January 7, 2019: Monday\n   - Therefore, the first Monday of 2019 is January 7, 2019.\n\n3. **Find the date one year ago from January 7, 2019:**\n   - One year before January 7, 2019, is January 7, 2018.\n\n4. **Match the date with the given options:**\n   - We need to find which option corresponds to January 7, 2018.\n   - Option (B) is 01/07/2018, which matches the date we calculated.\n\nTherefore, the date one year ago from the first Monday of 2019 is January 7, 2018.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<01/07/2018>>>."
