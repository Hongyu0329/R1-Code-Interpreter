    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week after the last day of 1899. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Last Day of 1899:**\n   - The last day of 1899 is December 31, 1899. In MM/DD/YYYY format, this is 12/31/1899.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week from December 31, 1899:**\n   - One week consists of 7 days. Therefore, we need to add 7 days to December 31, 1899.\n\n3. **Add 7 Days to December 31, 1899:**\n   - Adding 7 days to December 31, 1899, brings us to January 7, 1900. This is because:\n     - December 31, 1899 + 1 day = January 1, 1900\n     - January 1, 1900 + 6 more days = January 7, 1900\n\n4. **Convert the Date to MM/DD/YYYY Format:**\n   - January 7, 1900, in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/07/1900.\n\n5. **Match the Calculated Date with the Given Options:**\n   - The calculated date, 01/07/1900, matches option (D) 01/07/1900.\n\nTherefore, the date one week from the last day of 1899 is 01/07/1900.\n\nFinal answer: <<<01/07/1900>>>."
