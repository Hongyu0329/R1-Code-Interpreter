    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs and then calculate the date 10 days before that. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the number of days Jane had eggs:**\n   - Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.\n   - She ate one egg per day.\n   - Therefore, she had enough eggs for 40 days.\n\n2. **Calculate the date when Jane ran out of eggs:**\n   - Starting from May 9th, 2017, we add 40 days to find out when she ran out of eggs.\n   - May has 31 days. From May 9th to May 31st is 23 days.\n   - 40 days - 23 days = 17 days remaining in June.\n   - Therefore, Jane ran out of eggs on June 17th, 2017.\n\n3. **Calculate the date 10 days before she ran out of eggs:**\n   - 10 days before June 17th, 2017 is June 7th, 2017.\n\n4. **Match the calculated date with the given options:**\n   - The date 10 days before June 17th, 2017 is June 7th, 2017.\n   - However, none of the options directly match June 7th, 2017.\n   - The closest option is June 6th, 2017, which is one day off.\n\nGiven the options, the most reasonable choice is (B) 06/06/2017.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<06/06/2017>>>"
