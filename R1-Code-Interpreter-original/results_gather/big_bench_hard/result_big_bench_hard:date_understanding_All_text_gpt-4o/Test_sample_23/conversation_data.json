    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current date based on the information given and then calculate the date one week prior to that.\n\n1. **Understanding the Timeframe:**\n   - The statement \"2015 is coming in 36 hours\" indicates that the current time is 36 hours before the start of 2015.\n   - The start of 2015 is January 1, 2015, at 00:00 (midnight).\n\n2. **Calculating the Current Date and Time:**\n   - If 2015 starts at 00:00 on January 1, 2015, then 36 hours before this would be:\n     - 24 hours before would be December 31, 2014, at 00:00.\n     - An additional 12 hours before that would be December 30, 2014, at 12:00 (noon).\n\n3. **Finding the Date One Week Ago:**\n   - One week (7 days) before December 30, 2014, is December 23, 2014.\n\n4. **Matching with the Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches December 23, 2014.\n   - Option (B) is 12/23/2014, which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today, given the context, is December 23, 2014.\n\n<<<B>>>"
