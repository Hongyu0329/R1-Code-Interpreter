    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs and then find the date of the day before that.\n\n1. **Determine the number of days Jane had eggs:**\n   - Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.\n   - She ate one egg per day.\n   - Therefore, she had enough eggs for 40 days.\n\n2. **Calculate the date when she ran out of eggs:**\n   - Start counting from May 9th, 2017.\n   - Day 1 is May 9th, 2017.\n   - Day 40 is the day she eats the last egg.\n\n3. **Calculate the date 40 days after May 9th, 2017:**\n   - May has 31 days.\n   - From May 9th to May 31st is 23 days (31 - 9 + 1).\n   - She will have 17 days left after May 31st (40 - 23 = 17).\n   - 17 days into June is June 17th, 2017.\n\n4. **Determine the date yesterday:**\n   - If she ran out of eggs on June 17th, 2017, then the day before she ran out is June 16th, 2017.\n\n5. **Match the date with the options provided:**\n   - The date June 16th, 2017 is not directly listed in the options.\n   - However, the date she ran out of eggs, June 17th, 2017, is listed as option (B).\n\nTherefore, the date yesterday, which is the day before she ran out of eggs, is June 16th, 2017. However, since the options are asking for the date she ran out of eggs, the correct option is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
