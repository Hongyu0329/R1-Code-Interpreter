    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 10 days before the given deadline of June 1, 2021. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Deadline Date**: The deadline is June 1, 2021.\n\n2. **Calculate the Date 10 Days Ago**: \n   - Start from June 1, 2021.\n   - Subtract 10 days from June 1, 2021.\n\n3. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - June 1, 2021, minus 10 days takes us back into the previous month, May.\n   - Subtracting 1 day from June 1 gives us May 31, 2021.\n   - Subtracting an additional 9 days from May 31, 2021, takes us to May 22, 2021.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Counting backwards from June 1: \n     - May 31 (1 day)\n     - May 30 (2 days)\n     - May 29 (3 days)\n     - May 28 (4 days)\n     - May 27 (5 days)\n     - May 26 (6 days)\n     - May 25 (7 days)\n     - May 24 (8 days)\n     - May 23 (9 days)\n     - May 22 (10 days)\n\n5. **Match the Calculated Date with the Options**:\n   - The calculated date is May 22, 2021.\n   - Check the options provided:\n     - (A) 04/29/2021\n     - (B) 05/21/2021\n     - (C) 04/06/2021\n     - (D) 06/24/2021\n     - (E) 05/20/2021\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the options directly match May 22, 2021.\n   - Re-evaluate the options to ensure no oversight:\n     - The closest option is (B) 05/21/2021, but it is not the correct date.\n\nSince none of the options match the calculated date of May 22, 2021, it appears there is an error in the options provided. However, based on the calculation, the date 10 days before June 1, 2021, is May 22, 2021.\n\n<<<05/22/2021>>>"
