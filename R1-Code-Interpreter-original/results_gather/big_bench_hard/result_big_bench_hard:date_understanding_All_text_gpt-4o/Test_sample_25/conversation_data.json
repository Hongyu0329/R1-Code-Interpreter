    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week from today, given that today is July 29, 2002. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Today's Date**: \n   - Today is July 29, 2002.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week from Today**:\n   - One week from today means adding 7 days to the current date.\n   - July 29, 2002 + 7 days = August 5, 2002.\n\n3. **Convert the Date to the Required Format**:\n   - The date August 5, 2002, needs to be converted to the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - In MM/DD/YYYY format, August 5, 2002, is written as 08/05/2002.\n\n4. **Compare with Given Options**:\n   - We need to find the option that matches 08/05/2002.\n   - The options provided are:\n     - (A) 08/03/2002\n     - (B) 10/22/2002\n     - (C) 06/03/2002\n     - (D) 08/04/2002\n     - (E) 08/04/1930\n     - (F) 07/04/2003\n\n5. **Determine the Correct Option**:\n   - None of the options match 08/05/2002 exactly.\n   - Therefore, there is no correct option provided that matches the calculated date.\n\nSince none of the options match the calculated date of 08/05/2002, the problem seems to have an error or oversight in the options provided. However, based on the calculation, the date one week from July 29, 2002, is 08/05/2002.\n\nThe final answer, based on the calculation, is:\n<<<08/05/2002>>>"
