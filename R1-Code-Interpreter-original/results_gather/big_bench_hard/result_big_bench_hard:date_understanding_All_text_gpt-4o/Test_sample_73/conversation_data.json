    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week after the last day of January 2012. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Last Day of January 2012:**\n   - January has 31 days, so the last day of January 2012 is January 31, 2012.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week from January 31, 2012:**\n   - One week consists of 7 days.\n   - Adding 7 days to January 31, 2012, we move into the next month, February.\n\n3. **Determine the Date:**\n   - Starting from January 31, 2012, and adding 7 days:\n     - January 31 + 1 day = February 1\n     - February 1 + 6 more days = February 7\n\n4. **Verify the Year:**\n   - Since we are moving from January to February within the same year, the year remains 2012.\n\n5. **Format the Date:**\n   - The date one week from January 31, 2012, is February 7, 2012.\n   - In MM/DD/YYYY format, this is 02/07/2012.\n\n6. **Match with the Given Options:**\n   - The correct option that matches 02/07/2012 is option (F).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
