    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one year ago from today, given that 176 days have passed since Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Date 176 Days After March 20, 2020:**\n   - March 20, 2020, is the starting point.\n   - March has 31 days, so from March 20 to March 31, there are 11 days.\n   - April has 30 days.\n   - May has 31 days.\n   - June has 30 days.\n   - July has 31 days.\n   - August has 31 days.\n   - September has 30 days.\n   - We need to calculate how many days are left after accounting for full months.\n\n   Let's add up the days:\n   - March 20 to March 31: 11 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 31 days\n   - August: 31 days\n   - Total from March 20 to August 31: 11 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 164 days\n\n   Since 176 days have passed, we need 176 - 164 = 12 more days into September.\n\n   Therefore, 176 days after March 20, 2020, is September 12, 2020.\n\n2. **Determine the Date One Year Ago from September 12, 2020:**\n   - One year ago from September 12, 2020, is September 12, 2019.\n\n3. **Match the Date with the Given Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches September 12, 2019.\n\n   Let's review the options:\n   (A) 09/20/2019\n   (B) 10/01/2019\n   (C) 10/24/2019\n   (D) 09/12/1970\n   (E) 09/12/2019\n\n   The correct option is (E) 09/12/2019.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
