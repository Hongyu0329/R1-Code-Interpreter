    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct date 24 hours after the date John believes it to be, which is 6/19/2019. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Date:**\n   - John thinks today is 6/19/2019, and he is correct. Therefore, the current date is 6/19/2019.\n\n2. **Calculate 24 Hours Later:**\n   - 24 hours later means adding one day to the current date.\n   - Adding one day to 6/19/2019 results in 6/20/2019.\n\n3. **Verify the Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches the calculated date of 6/20/2019.\n   - Option (A) is 06/20/2019, which matches our calculated date.\n\n4. **Check Other Options:**\n   - Option (B) is 06/22/2019, which is two days later than our calculated date.\n   - Option (C) is 06/29/2019, which is ten days later than our calculated date.\n   - Option (D) is 06/21/2019, which is one day later than our calculated date.\n   - Option (E) is 06/20/2028, which is nine years later than our calculated date.\n   - Option (F) is 06/20/1921, which is 98 years earlier than our calculated date.\n\n5. **Select the Correct Option:**\n   - The only option that matches the calculated date of 6/20/2019 is Option (A).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<06/20/2019>>>"
