    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given date format and determine the correct date one year prior to the given date.\n\n1. **Understand the Date Format:**\n   - The date given is \"02/01/1987\" in UK format, which means \"day/month/year.\"\n   - Therefore, \"02/01/1987\" translates to January 2, 1987, in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Determine the Date One Year Ago:**\n   - To find the date one year ago from January 2, 1987, we subtract one year from the year 1987.\n   - This results in the date January 2, 1986.\n\n3. **Convert to MM/DD/YYYY Format:**\n   - The date January 2, 1986, in MM/DD/YYYY format is \"01/02/1986.\"\n\n4. **Match with the Given Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches \"01/02/1986.\"\n   - Option (B) is \"01/02/1986,\" which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
