    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one year ago from today, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Today's Date:**\n   - If yesterday was April 30, 2021, then today is May 1, 2021.\n\n2. **Calculate One Year Ago:**\n   - To find the date one year ago from May 1, 2021, we subtract one year from the current year.\n   - Subtracting one year from May 1, 2021, gives us May 1, 2020.\n\n3. **Verify the Options:**\n   - We need to match the calculated date (May 1, 2020) with the given options.\n   - Option (A) is 05/15/2020, which is not a match.\n   - Option (B) is 05/01/2020, which matches our calculated date.\n   - Option (C) is 05/08/2020, which is not a match.\n   - Option (D) is 04/01/2020, which is not a match.\n   - Option (E) is 05/01/1971, which is not a match.\n\n4. **Select the Correct Option:**\n   - The correct option that matches the date one year ago from today is Option (B) 05/01/2020.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<05/01/2020>>>"
