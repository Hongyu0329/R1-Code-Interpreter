    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week from the last day of the first quarter of 2008. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the last day of the first quarter of 2008:**\n   - The first quarter of the year includes January, February, and March.\n   - Therefore, the last day of the first quarter is March 31, 2008.\n\n2. **Calculate the date one week from March 31, 2008:**\n   - One week from March 31, 2008, is 7 days later.\n   - Adding 7 days to March 31, 2008, brings us to April 7, 2008.\n\n3. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - March has 31 days, so adding 7 days to March 31 means moving into the next month.\n   - April 1 is the day after March 31, and counting forward 7 days from March 31 gives us April 7.\n\n4. **Match the calculated date with the given options:**\n   - The calculated date, April 7, 2008, matches option (E) 04/07/2008.\n\nTherefore, the date one week from the last day of the first quarter of 2008 is April 7, 2008.\n\nFinal answer: <<<E>>>."
