    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the date one year ago from April 10, 1985, and then match it with the given options. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Today's Date**: \n   - Today is April 10, 1985.\n\n2. **Determine the Date One Year Ago**:\n   - One year ago from April 10, 1985, would be April 10, 1984. This is because subtracting one year from the current year (1985) gives us 1984, and the month and day remain the same.\n\n3. **Match with the Given Options**:\n   - We need to find the option that matches April 10, 1984.\n   - Let's examine the options:\n     - (A) 03/10/1986: This is March 10, 1986, which is not correct.\n     - (B) 04/07/1985: This is April 7, 1985, which is not correct.\n     - (C) 05/13/1985: This is May 13, 1985, which is not correct.\n     - (D) 04/10/1984: This is April 10, 1984, which matches our calculated date.\n     - (E) 04/12/1986: This is April 12, 1986, which is not correct.\n     - (F) 04/10/1985: This is April 10, 1985, which is not correct.\n\n4. **Select the Correct Option**:\n   - The correct option that matches April 10, 1984, is (D) 04/10/1984.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
