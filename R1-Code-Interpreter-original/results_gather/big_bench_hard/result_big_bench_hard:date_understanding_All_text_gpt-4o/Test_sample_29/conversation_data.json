    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Jane's 5th visit to the bookstore, given that she started visiting on October 16, 2009, and visits on the 16th of each month.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the starting date**: Jane's first visit is on October 16, 2009.\n\n2. **Determine the sequence of visits**:\n   - 1st visit: October 16, 2009\n   - 2nd visit: November 16, 2009\n   - 3rd visit: December 16, 2009\n   - 4th visit: January 16, 2010\n   - 5th visit: February 16, 2010\n\n3. **Verify the sequence**: We need to ensure that the sequence of visits is correct and that each visit occurs on the 16th of the respective month.\n\n4. **Match the 5th visit with the options provided**: The 5th visit is on February 16, 2010. We need to find this date among the given options.\n\n5. **Check the options**:\n   - (A) 02/06/2010: This is February 6, 2010, which is not the 16th.\n   - (B) 12/21/2009: This is December 21, 2009, which is not the 16th.\n   - (C) 02/16/1933: This is February 16, 1933, which is not the correct year.\n   - (D) 02/16/2010: This is February 16, 2010, which matches our calculated 5th visit.\n   - (E) 11/30/2009: This is November 30, 2009, which is not the 16th.\n   - (F) 05/24/2010: This is May 24, 2010, which is not the 16th.\n\n6. **Select the correct option**: The correct date for Jane's 5th visit is February 16, 2010, which corresponds to option (D).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<02/16/2010>>>"
