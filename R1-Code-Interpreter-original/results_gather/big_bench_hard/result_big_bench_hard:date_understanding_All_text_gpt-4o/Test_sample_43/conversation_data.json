    "To determine the date 176 days after March 20, 2020, we need to carefully consider the number of days in each month and account for leap years if necessary. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Start Date**: March 20, 2020.\n\n2. **Days Remaining in March**: March has 31 days. Since Jane quit on March 20, there are 11 days remaining in March (31 - 20 = 11).\n\n3. **Days to Account for**: We need to account for 176 days in total. After March, we have 176 - 11 = 165 days remaining to account for.\n\n4. **April**: April has 30 days. Subtracting these from the remaining days: 165 - 30 = 135 days.\n\n5. **May**: May has 31 days. Subtracting these from the remaining days: 135 - 31 = 104 days.\n\n6. **June**: June has 30 days. Subtracting these from the remaining days: 104 - 30 = 74 days.\n\n7. **July**: July has 31 days. Subtracting these from the remaining days: 74 - 31 = 43 days.\n\n8. **August**: August has 31 days. Subtracting these from the remaining days: 43 - 31 = 12 days.\n\n9. **September**: September has 30 days. Since we only have 12 days remaining, we will reach the final date in September. Adding 12 days to September 1 gives us September 12.\n\n10. **Final Date**: Therefore, 176 days after March 20, 2020, is September 12, 2020.\n\nNow, let's match this date with the given options:\n\n- (A) 09/12/2020\n- (B) 11/12/2020\n- (C) 12/12/2020\n- (D) 09/12/1961\n- (E) 09/17/2020\n\nThe correct option is (A) 09/12/2020.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<09/12/2020>>>"
