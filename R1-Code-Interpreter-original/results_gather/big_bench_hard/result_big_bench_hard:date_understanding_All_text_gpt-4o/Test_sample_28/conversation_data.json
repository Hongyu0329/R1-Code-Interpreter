    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week ago from today, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Today's Date:**\n   - If yesterday was April 30, 2021, then today is May 1, 2021.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week Ago:**\n   - One week ago from today (May 1, 2021) would be 7 days prior.\n   - Subtracting 7 days from May 1, 2021, we get April 24, 2021.\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Start from May 1, 2021, and count backwards:\n     - April 30, 2021 (1 day back)\n     - April 29, 2021 (2 days back)\n     - April 28, 2021 (3 days back)\n     - April 27, 2021 (4 days back)\n     - April 26, 2021 (5 days back)\n     - April 25, 2021 (6 days back)\n     - April 24, 2021 (7 days back)\n\n4. **Match with Options:**\n   - The calculated date, April 24, 2021, matches option (F).\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today is April 24, 2021.\n\nThe final answer is <<<F>>>."
