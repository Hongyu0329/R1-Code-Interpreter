    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week from today, given that yesterday was January 21, 2011. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Yesterday's Date**: We are told that yesterday was January 21, 2011.\n\n2. **Determine Today's Date**: Since yesterday was January 21, 2011, today must be January 22, 2011.\n\n3. **Calculate One Week from Today**: One week from today means adding 7 days to today's date, January 22, 2011.\n\n4. **Perform the Date Calculation**:\n   - Start with January 22, 2011.\n   - Add 7 days to January 22, 2011.\n   - January has 31 days, so adding 7 days to January 22 will not exceed the month.\n   - January 22 + 7 days = January 29, 2011.\n\n5. **Format the Date**: The date one week from today is January 29, 2011, which in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/29/2011.\n\n6. **Match with Given Options**: We need to find the option that matches the calculated date:\n   - (A) 01/30/2011\n   - (B) 04/10/2011\n   - (C) 01/29/2011\n   - (D) 01/28/2011\n   - (E) 06/29/2010\n\n   The correct option is (C) 01/29/2011.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<01/29/2011>>>"
