    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week ago from today, given that yesterday was January 21, 2011. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Yesterday's Date**: \n   - The problem states that yesterday was January 21, 2011.\n\n2. **Determine Today's Date**:\n   - If yesterday was January 21, 2011, then today is January 22, 2011.\n\n3. **Calculate One Week Ago from Today**:\n   - One week ago from January 22, 2011, would be 7 days prior.\n   - Subtracting 7 days from January 22, 2011, we get January 15, 2011.\n\n4. **Match the Calculated Date with the Options**:\n   - We need to find which option corresponds to January 15, 2011.\n   - Option (B) is 01/15/2011, which matches our calculated date.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - January 22, 2011, minus 7 days is indeed January 15, 2011. This confirms our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today is January 15, 2011.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B>>>."
