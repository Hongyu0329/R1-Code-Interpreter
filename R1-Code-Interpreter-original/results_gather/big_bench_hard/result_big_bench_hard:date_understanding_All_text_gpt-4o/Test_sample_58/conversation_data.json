    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct date 10 days ago from the actual date, which is March 12, 2002. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Actual Date**: \n   - Jane thought today was March 11, 2002, but it is actually March 12, 2002.\n\n2. **Calculate 10 Days Ago**:\n   - From March 12, 2002, we need to go back 10 days.\n   - Subtracting 10 days from March 12, 2002, we get March 2, 2002.\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Start from March 12, 2002, and count backwards:\n     - March 11, 2002 (1 day back)\n     - March 10, 2002 (2 days back)\n     - March 9, 2002 (3 days back)\n     - March 8, 2002 (4 days back)\n     - March 7, 2002 (5 days back)\n     - March 6, 2002 (6 days back)\n     - March 5, 2002 (7 days back)\n     - March 4, 2002 (8 days back)\n     - March 3, 2002 (9 days back)\n     - March 2, 2002 (10 days back)\n\n4. **Match with the Options**:\n   - We need to find the date March 2, 2002, in the given options.\n   - Option (F) is 03/02/2002, which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date 10 days ago from March 12, 2002, is March 2, 2002.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<F>>>."
