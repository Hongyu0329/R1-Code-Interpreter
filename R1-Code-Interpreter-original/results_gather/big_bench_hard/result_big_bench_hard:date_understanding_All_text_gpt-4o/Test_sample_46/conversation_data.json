    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 24 hours after Jane's 16th birthday. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Jane's Birth Date:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001.\n   - 2001 is not a leap year (as it is not divisible by 4), so February has 28 days.\n   - Therefore, Jane was born on February 28, 2001.\n\n2. **Determine Jane's 16th Birthday:**\n   - If Jane was born on February 28, 2001, her 16th birthday would be on February 28, 2017.\n\n3. **Calculate the Date 24 Hours Later:**\n   - 24 hours after February 28, 2017, would be March 1, 2017.\n   - This is because February 28, 2017, is followed by March 1, 2017, in a non-leap year.\n\n4. **Match the Date with the Given Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches March 1, 2017.\n   - Option (C) is 03/01/2017, which matches the calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date 24 hours after Jane's 16th birthday is March 1, 2017.\n\nFinal answer: <<<C>>>."
