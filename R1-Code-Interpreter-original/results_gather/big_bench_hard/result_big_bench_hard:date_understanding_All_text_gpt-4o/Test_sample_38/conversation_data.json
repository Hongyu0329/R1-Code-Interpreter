    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date exactly one month before December 31, 1929. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Date Context**: \n   - Yesterday was 12/31/1929, which means today is 01/01/1930.\n   - We need to find the date one month before 12/31/1929.\n\n2. **Determine the Month Before December**:\n   - The month before December is November.\n\n3. **Consider the Year**:\n   - Since we are moving from December 1929 to November 1929, the year remains 1929.\n\n4. **Determine the Day**:\n   - December 31, 1929, is the last day of December.\n   - To find the corresponding day in November, we need to consider the number of days in November.\n   - November has 30 days.\n\n5. **Calculate the Date**:\n   - One month before December 31, 1929, is November 30, 1929.\n\n6. **Match with the Options**:\n   - We need to find the option that corresponds to November 30, 1929.\n   - None of the options directly match November 30, 1929.\n   - However, the closest logical option is the first day of December, which is 12/01/1929.\n\n7. **Select the Closest Option**:\n   - The closest option to November 30, 1929, is 12/01/1929.\n\nTherefore, the date a month ago in the context of the given options is 12/01/1929.\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
