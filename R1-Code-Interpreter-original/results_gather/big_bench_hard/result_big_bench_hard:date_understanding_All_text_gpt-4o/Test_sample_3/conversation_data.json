    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the date one week ago from the given date, which is Tuesday, July 9, 1972 (07/09/1972).\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Date**: The problem states that Jane scheduled appointments for Tuesday, July 9, 1972. This is the reference date we will use to calculate the date one week ago.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week Ago**: One week consists of 7 days. To find the date one week ago from July 9, 1972, we need to subtract 7 days from this date.\n\n3. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - Start with the date: 07/09/1972.\n   - Subtract 7 days from the 9th of July.\n   - 9 - 7 = 2.\n\n4. **Determine the Resulting Date**: After subtracting 7 days, we arrive at July 2, 1972.\n\n5. **Format the Date**: The resulting date is July 2, 1972, which in MM/DD/YYYY format is 07/02/1972.\n\n6. **Match with Options**: Compare the calculated date with the provided options:\n   - (A) 07/09/1972\n   - (B) 12/01/1972\n   - (C) 07/01/2008\n   - (D) 05/13/1972\n   - (E) 07/01/1972\n   - (F) 08/12/1972\n\n   None of the options directly match 07/02/1972. However, the closest date in the options is (E) 07/01/1972, which is one day earlier than our calculated date.\n\n7. **Consider the Closest Option**: Since none of the options exactly match, and given the context of the problem, the closest option is (E) 07/01/1972.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
