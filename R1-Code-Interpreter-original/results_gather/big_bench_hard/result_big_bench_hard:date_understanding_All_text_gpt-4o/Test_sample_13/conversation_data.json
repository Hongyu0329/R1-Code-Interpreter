    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the palindrome day of 2020 in the MMDDYYYY format and then determine the date exactly one month before it.\n\n1. **Identify the Palindrome Day:**\n   - A palindrome day in the MMDDYYYY format means the date reads the same forwards and backwards.\n   - The year is 2020, so the format is MMDD2020.\n   - The palindrome format would be MMDD2020 = 02022020, which corresponds to February 2, 2020 (02/02/2020).\n\n2. **Calculate the Date One Month Before:**\n   - We need to find the date one month before February 2, 2020.\n   - One month before February 2, 2020, is January 2, 2020.\n\n3. **Match with the Options:**\n   - We compare January 2, 2020, with the given options:\n     - (A) 01/01/2020\n     - (B) 01/02/2020\n     - (C) 10/02/2019\n     - (D) 11/05/2019\n     - (E) 01/02/1931\n     - (F) 01/03/2020\n\n   - The correct match is (B) 01/02/2020.\n\nTherefore, the date a month ago from the palindrome day of 2020 is January 2, 2020.\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
