    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs and then calculate the date one week from that day. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Start Date:**\n   - Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.\n\n2. **Calculate the Duration Jane Consumed the Eggs:**\n   - Jane ate one egg per day. Therefore, she consumed all 40 eggs in 40 days.\n\n3. **Determine the Date She Ran Out of Eggs:**\n   - Starting from May 9th, 2017, we add 40 days to find out when she ran out of eggs.\n   - May has 31 days. From May 9th to May 31st is 22 days.\n   - 40 days - 22 days = 18 days remaining to be counted in June.\n   - Adding 18 days to June 1st gives us June 18th, 2017.\n\n4. **Calculate the Date One Week from June 18th, 2017:**\n   - One week from June 18th, 2017, is June 25th, 2017.\n\n5. **Match the Date with the Given Options:**\n   - The date one week from June 18th, 2017, is June 25th, 2017, which matches option (E).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
