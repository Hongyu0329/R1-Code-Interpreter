    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date tomorrow based on the information given about Jane's birthday and her current age.\n\n1. **Identify Jane's Birth Date:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001.\n   - 2001 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days.\n   - Therefore, Jane's birth date is 02/28/2001.\n\n2. **Determine Jane's Current Age:**\n   - Today is her 16-year-old birthday.\n   - This means today is 16 years after her birth date, 02/28/2001.\n\n3. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Adding 16 years to 02/28/2001 gives us 02/28/2017.\n   - Therefore, today is 02/28/2017.\n\n4. **Determine Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Tomorrow is the day after 02/28/2017.\n   - Since 2017 is not a leap year, February has 28 days.\n   - Therefore, the day after 02/28/2017 is 03/01/2017.\n\n5. **Select the Correct Option:**\n   - The date 03/01/2017 corresponds to option (B).\n\nThus, the date tomorrow is 03/01/2017.\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
