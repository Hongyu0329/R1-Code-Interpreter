    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 24 hours after March 5, 1973. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Date**: The current date is given as 3/5/1973, which is March 5, 1973.\n\n2. **Determine the Date 24 Hours Later**: Since we are looking for the date exactly 24 hours later, we need to add one day to the current date.\n\n3. **Add One Day to the Current Date**: \n   - March 5, 1973, plus one day is March 6, 1973.\n\n4. **Verify the Options**: \n   - (A) 03/06/1973: This matches our calculated date.\n   - (B) 03/02/1973: This is earlier than the current date.\n   - (C) 03/08/1983: This is a different year and later in March.\n   - (D) 04/05/1973: This is a different month.\n   - (E) 03/05/1972: This is a different year and the same day as the current date.\n   - (F) 01/02/1973: This is a different month and earlier in the year.\n\n5. **Select the Correct Option**: The only option that matches the date 24 hours after March 5, 1973, is option (A) 03/06/1973.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
