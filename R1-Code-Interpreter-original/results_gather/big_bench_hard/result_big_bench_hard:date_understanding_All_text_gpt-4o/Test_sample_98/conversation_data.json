    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 10 days before Jane's 16th birthday. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Determine Jane's Birth Date:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001.\n   - 2001 is not a leap year (as it is not divisible by 4), so February 28, 2001, is the last day of February.\n\n2. **Calculate Jane's 16th Birthday:**\n   - Jane's 16th birthday would be 16 years after February 28, 2001.\n   - Adding 16 years to 2001 gives us 2017.\n   - Therefore, Jane's 16th birthday is on February 28, 2017.\n\n3. **Calculate the Date 10 Days Before Her 16th Birthday:**\n   - We need to find the date 10 days before February 28, 2017.\n   - Counting back 10 days from February 28, 2017:\n     - February 28 minus 10 days is February 18, 2017.\n\n4. **Verify the Options:**\n   - We need to check which option corresponds to February 18, 2017.\n   - Option (B) is 02/18/2017, which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date 10 days before Jane's 16th birthday is February 18, 2017.\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
