    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 10 days before January 21, 2011. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given date**: The problem states that \"yesterday\" was January 21, 2011. Therefore, today is January 22, 2011.\n\n2. **Calculate 10 days ago from January 22, 2011**:\n   - Start from January 22, 2011.\n   - Subtract 10 days from this date.\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction**:\n   - January 22, 2011 minus 10 days is January 12, 2011.\n\n4. **Verify the calculation**:\n   - Counting backwards from January 22, 2011:\n     - January 21, 2011 (1 day back)\n     - January 20, 2011 (2 days back)\n     - January 19, 2011 (3 days back)\n     - January 18, 2011 (4 days back)\n     - January 17, 2011 (5 days back)\n     - January 16, 2011 (6 days back)\n     - January 15, 2011 (7 days back)\n     - January 14, 2011 (8 days back)\n     - January 13, 2011 (9 days back)\n     - January 12, 2011 (10 days back)\n\n5. **Match the calculated date with the options provided**:\n   - The calculated date, January 12, 2011, matches option (B).\n\nTherefore, the date 10 days ago from January 21, 2011, is January 12, 2011.\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
