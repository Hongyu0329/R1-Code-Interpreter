    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary and then calculate the date 10 days before that anniversary.\n\n1. **Understanding the Golden Wedding Anniversary:**\n   - A golden wedding anniversary marks 50 years of marriage.\n   - Jane and John married on January 2, 1958.\n   - Therefore, their golden wedding anniversary would be 50 years later, on January 2, 2008.\n\n2. **Calculating the Date 10 Days Before the Anniversary:**\n   - We need to find the date 10 days before January 2, 2008.\n   - Subtracting 10 days from January 2, 2008, we move back into the previous month, December 2007.\n   - January 2 minus 10 days is December 23, 2007.\n\n3. **Verifying the Calculation:**\n   - Start from January 2, 2008, and count backwards:\n     - January 1, 2008\n     - December 31, 2007\n     - December 30, 2007\n     - December 29, 2007\n     - December 28, 2007\n     - December 27, 2007\n     - December 26, 2007\n     - December 25, 2007\n     - December 24, 2007\n     - December 23, 2007\n\n4. **Matching with the Given Options:**\n   - The calculated date, December 23, 2007, matches option (E).\n\nTherefore, the date 10 days ago from their golden wedding anniversary is December 23, 2007.\n\n<<<E>>>"
