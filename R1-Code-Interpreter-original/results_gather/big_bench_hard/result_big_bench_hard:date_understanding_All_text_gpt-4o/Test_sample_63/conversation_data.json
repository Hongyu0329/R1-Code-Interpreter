    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 24 hours after July 29, 2002. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Date**: The initial date given is July 29, 2002. In the format MM/DD/YYYY, this is 07/29/2002.\n\n2. **Determine the Time Frame**: We are asked to find the date 24 hours later. Since 24 hours is equivalent to one full day, we need to add one day to the initial date.\n\n3. **Add One Day**: \n   - Start with the date 07/29/2002.\n   - Adding one day to July 29, 2002, results in July 30, 2002.\n\n4. **Verify the Result**: \n   - July has 31 days, so adding one day to July 29 does not change the month or year, only the day.\n   - Therefore, the date 24 hours after July 29, 2002, is indeed July 30, 2002.\n\n5. **Match with Options**: \n   - Option (C) is 07/30/2002, which matches our calculated date.\n\n6. **Check Other Options**: \n   - Option (A) 07/29/2001 is a year earlier.\n   - Option (B) 04/24/2002 is a different month and day.\n   - Option (D) 07/28/2002 is a day earlier.\n   - Option (E) 07/29/2002 is the same day, not 24 hours later.\n   - Option (F) 07/29/1947 is a different year.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C) 07/30/2002.\n\n<<<C>>>"
