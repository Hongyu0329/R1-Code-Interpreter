    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane runs out of eggs and then find the date for the next day.\n\n1. **Initial Purchase Date**: Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.\n\n2. **Consumption Rate**: Jane eats one egg per day.\n\n3. **Total Days of Consumption**: Since Jane eats one egg per day and she bought 40 eggs, she will run out of eggs after 40 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Date She Runs Out of Eggs**:\n   - Start counting from May 9th, 2017.\n   - May has 31 days. From May 9th to May 31st is 23 days.\n   - She will have 40 - 23 = 17 eggs left after May 31st.\n   - She continues eating one egg per day into June.\n   - She will run out of eggs 17 days into June.\n\n5. **Determine the Date She Runs Out of Eggs**:\n   - June 1st is the 24th day since May 9th.\n   - June 17th is the 40th day since May 9th.\n\n6. **Date She Runs Out of Eggs**: Jane runs out of eggs on June 17th, 2017.\n\n7. **Determine the Date Tomorrow**: The day after June 17th, 2017, is June 18th, 2017.\n\n8. **Format the Answer**: The date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format is 06/18/2017.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
