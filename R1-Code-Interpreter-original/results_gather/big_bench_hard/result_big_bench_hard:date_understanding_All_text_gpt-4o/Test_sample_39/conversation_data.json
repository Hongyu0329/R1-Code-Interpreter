    "To determine the date one week from 4/19/1969, we need to add 7 days to the given date. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Date**: The current date is 4/19/1969.\n\n2. **Understand the Month and Year**: \n   - The month is April, which has 30 days.\n   - The year is 1969.\n\n3. **Add 7 Days to the Current Date**:\n   - Start from April 19, 1969.\n   - Adding 7 days to April 19, 1969, results in April 26, 1969.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - April 19 + 7 days = April 26.\n   - Since April has 30 days, adding 7 days to the 19th does not exceed the number of days in April.\n\n5. **Check the Options**:\n   - (A) 04/26/1969\n   - (B) 04/05/1969\n   - (C) 05/11/1969\n   - (D) 04/27/1969\n   - (E) 05/14/1969\n   - (F) 04/25/1969\n\n6. **Select the Correct Option**:\n   - The correct date one week from 4/19/1969 is 04/26/1969, which matches option (A).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
