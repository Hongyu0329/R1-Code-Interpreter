    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date today based on the information given about Jane's birthdate and her current age.\n\n1. **Identify Jane's Birthdate:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001.\n   - 2001 is not a leap year (leap years are divisible by 4, but not every year divisible by 100 is a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400).\n   - Therefore, the last day of February 2001 is February 28, 2001.\n\n2. **Calculate Jane's 16th Birthday:**\n   - Jane's 16th birthday would be 16 years after her birthdate.\n   - Adding 16 years to February 28, 2001, we get February 28, 2017.\n\n3. **Verify the Options:**\n   - We need to find which option matches the date we calculated for Jane's 16th birthday.\n   - The options are:\n     (A) 08/28/2017\n     (B) 02/22/2017\n     (C) 03/01/2017\n     (D) 01/28/2018\n     (E) 02/07/2017\n     (F) 02/28/2017\n\n4. **Match the Calculated Date with the Options:**\n   - The calculated date for Jane's 16th birthday is February 28, 2017.\n   - The option that matches this date is (F) 02/28/2017.\n\nTherefore, the date today, which is Jane's 16-year-old birthday, is February 28, 2017.\n\nThe final answer is <<<F>>>."
