    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs and then find the date 24 hours later.\n\n1. **Initial Purchase Date**: Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017.\n\n2. **Consumption Rate**: Jane eats one egg per day.\n\n3. **Total Days of Consumption**: Since Jane bought 40 eggs and eats one per day, she will run out of eggs after 40 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Date She Runs Out of Eggs**:\n   - Start from May 9th, 2017.\n   - Add 40 days to this date to find out when she runs out of eggs.\n\n5. **Breakdown of Days**:\n   - May has 31 days. From May 9th to May 31st is 23 days.\n   - After May 31st, she needs 17 more days to reach a total of 40 days.\n\n6. **Continue into June**:\n   - Starting from June 1st, add 17 days.\n   - June 1st + 17 days = June 18th, 2017.\n\n7. **Date She Runs Out of Eggs**: Jane runs out of eggs on June 18th, 2017.\n\n8. **Find the Date 24 Hours Later**:\n   - 24 hours after June 18th, 2017, is June 19th, 2017.\n\n9. **Select the Correct Option**: The date 24 hours later is June 19th, 2017, which corresponds to option (A).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<06/19/2017>>>"
