    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the date 10 days before Tuesday, July 9, 1972. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given date**: The given date is Tuesday, July 9, 1972.\n\n2. **Calculate 10 days prior**: We need to subtract 10 days from July 9, 1972.\n\n3. **Subtract days from the month**: \n   - July 9, 1972, is in the month of July, which has 31 days.\n   - Subtracting 10 days from July 9, 1972, takes us back into the previous month, June.\n\n4. **Determine the date in June**:\n   - If we subtract 9 days, we reach June 30, 1972.\n   - Subtracting one more day (to make it 10 days total), we reach June 29, 1972.\n\n5. **Verify the options**: \n   - We need to check which of the given options matches June 29, 1972.\n   - The options provided are:\n     (A) 07/03/1972\n     (B) 10/28/1971\n     (C) 06/28/1972\n     (D) 06/14/1972\n     (E) 09/28/1972\n     (F) 06/23/1972\n\n6. **Find the closest match**: \n   - None of the options directly match June 29, 1972.\n   - However, option (C) 06/28/1972 is the closest date to June 29, 1972, and it is the only option that is within a day of the calculated date.\n\nGiven the options, the closest and most reasonable answer is option (C) 06/28/1972.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
