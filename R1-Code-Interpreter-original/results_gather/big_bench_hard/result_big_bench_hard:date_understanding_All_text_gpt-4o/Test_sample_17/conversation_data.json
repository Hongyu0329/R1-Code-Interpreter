    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date that is 176 days after March 20, 2020, and then find the date for the next day.\n\n1. **Identify the starting date**: Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of days remaining in March 2020**:\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - Days remaining in March after March 20: 31 - 20 = 11 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days in the subsequent months**:\n   - April has 30 days.\n   - May has 31 days.\n   - June has 30 days.\n   - July has 31 days.\n   - August has 31 days.\n\n4. **Add up the days to reach 176 days**:\n   - Days from March 20 to March 31: 11 days\n   - Days in April: 30 days\n   - Days in May: 31 days\n   - Days in June: 30 days\n   - Days in July: 31 days\n   - Total so far: 11 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 133 days\n\n5. **Determine the remaining days needed to reach 176 days**:\n   - 176 - 133 = 43 days remaining\n\n6. **Continue into August**:\n   - August has 31 days.\n   - After 31 days in August, we have 43 - 31 = 12 days remaining.\n\n7. **Move into September**:\n   - The 12th day of September is September 12, 2020.\n\n8. **Find the date for the next day**:\n   - The next day after September 12, 2020, is September 13, 2020.\n\n9. **Match the date with the options provided**:\n   - The date September 13, 2020, corresponds to option (A) 09/13/2020.\n\nTherefore, the date tomorrow is:\n\n<<<09/13/2020>>>"
