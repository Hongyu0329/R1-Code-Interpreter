    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one year ago from Jane's 16th birthday. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Determine Jane's Birth Date:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000. Since 2000 is a leap year, the last day of February is February 29, 2000.\n\n2. **Determine Jane's 16th Birthday:**\n   - Jane's 16th birthday would be 16 years after February 29, 2000. \n   - Since 2016 is also a leap year, February 29 exists in 2016. Therefore, Jane's 16th birthday is on February 29, 2016.\n\n3. **Determine the Date One Year Ago from February 29, 2016:**\n   - One year before February 29, 2016, would be February 28, 2015, because 2015 is not a leap year and does not have a February 29.\n\n4. **Match the Date with the Given Options:**\n   - We need to find which option corresponds to February 28, 2015.\n   - Option (A) is 02/28/2015, which matches the date we calculated.\n\nTherefore, the date one year ago from Jane's 16th birthday is February 28, 2015.\n\nFinal answer: <<<A>>>."
