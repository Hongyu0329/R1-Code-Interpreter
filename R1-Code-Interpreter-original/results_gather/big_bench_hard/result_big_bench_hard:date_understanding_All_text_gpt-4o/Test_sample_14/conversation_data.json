    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week from today, given that tomorrow is 11/12/2019. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Today's Date:**\n   - If tomorrow is 11/12/2019, then today must be 11/11/2019.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week from Today:**\n   - One week from 11/11/2019 is 11/18/2019. This is because adding 7 days to 11/11/2019 results in 11/18/2019.\n\n3. **Match the Calculated Date with the Options:**\n   - We need to find which option corresponds to 11/18/2019.\n   - Option (B) is 11/18/2019, which matches our calculated date.\n\n4. **Verify Other Options:**\n   - Option (A) is 08/21/2019, which is not correct.\n   - Option (C) is 11/18/2025, which is not correct.\n   - Option (D) is 11/18/2011, which is not correct.\n   - Option (E) is 02/18/2020, which is not correct.\n   - Option (F) is 11/04/2019, which is not correct.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only option that matches the calculated date of one week from today (11/11/2019) is option (B) 11/18/2019.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
