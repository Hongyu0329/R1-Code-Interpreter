    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date 176 days after March 20, 2020, and then add 24 hours to that date. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the starting date**: Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020.\n\n2. **Calculate 176 days from March 20, 2020**:\n   - March 20, 2020, is the starting point.\n   - March has 31 days, so from March 20 to March 31, there are 11 days.\n   - Subtract these 11 days from 176 days: 176 - 11 = 165 days remaining.\n\n3. **Continue counting from April 1, 2020**:\n   - April has 30 days. After April, 165 - 30 = 135 days remain.\n   - May has 31 days. After May, 135 - 31 = 104 days remain.\n   - June has 30 days. After June, 104 - 30 = 74 days remain.\n   - July has 31 days. After July, 74 - 31 = 43 days remain.\n   - August has 31 days. After August, 43 - 31 = 12 days remain.\n\n4. **Count into September 2020**:\n   - September 1 to September 12 accounts for the remaining 12 days.\n\n5. **Determine the date 24 hours later**:\n   - 24 hours later from September 12, 2020, is September 13, 2020.\n\n6. **Match the date with the options provided**:\n   - The date we calculated is September 13, 2020, which matches option (B).\n\nTherefore, the date 24 hours after 176 days from March 20, 2020, is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
