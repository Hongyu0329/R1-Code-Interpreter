    "To determine the date one week ago from 8/3/1997, we need to subtract 7 days from this date. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Date**: The current date is 8/3/1997, which is August 3, 1997.\n\n2. **Subtract One Week**: One week consists of 7 days. Therefore, we need to subtract 7 days from August 3, 1997.\n\n3. **Calculate the New Date**:\n   - Start from August 3, 1997.\n   - Subtract 7 days: \n     - August 3 minus 7 days takes us back to July 27, 1997.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - August has 31 days. \n   - If we count backward from August 3, we have:\n     - August 2\n     - August 1\n     - July 31\n     - July 30\n     - July 29\n     - July 28\n     - July 27\n\n5. **Match with Options**: Now, we need to match the calculated date, July 27, 1997, with the given options:\n   - (A) 03/27/1998\n   - (B) 09/02/1997\n   - (C) 07/27/1997\n   - (D) 06/29/1997\n   - (E) 07/27/1973\n   - (F) 12/27/1997\n\n6. **Select the Correct Option**: The date we calculated, July 27, 1997, matches option (C) 07/27/1997.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from 8/3/1997 is 07/27/1997.\n\n<<<C>>>"
