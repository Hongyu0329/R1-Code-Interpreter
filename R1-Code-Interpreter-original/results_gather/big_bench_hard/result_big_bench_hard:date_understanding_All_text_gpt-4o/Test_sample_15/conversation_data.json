    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date for \"tomorrow\" based on the information provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Date**: The problem states that Jane scheduled appointments for \"tomorrow,\" which is specified as \"Tue, 7/9/1972.\" This means that the date for the appointments is July 9, 1972.\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week**: The problem specifies that July 9, 1972, is a Tuesday. We need to verify this information to ensure accuracy. By checking a perpetual calendar or using a day-of-the-week calculator, we find that July 9, 1972, is indeed a Sunday, not a Tuesday. This discrepancy suggests that the problem might contain an error or that the date given is not the actual date for the appointments.\n\n3. **Identify the Correct Date for \"Tomorrow\"**: Since the problem states that the appointments are scheduled for \"tomorrow,\" and the given date is July 9, 1972, we need to determine the date for the day after July 9, 1972. The day after July 9, 1972, is July 10, 1972.\n\n4. **Match the Date with the Options**: Now, we need to find the option that corresponds to July 10, 1972. However, none of the options provided (A through F) match this date. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate the Problem**: Given that none of the options match the expected date of July 10, 1972, we need to consider the possibility that the problem contains a mistake or that the options are incorrect. However, since the task is to select an option, we must choose the closest possible match based on the information given.\n\n6. **Select the Closest Option**: Since the problem specifies \"tomorrow\" as July 9, 1972, and none of the options match July 10, 1972, we should select the option that matches the given date of July 9, 1972. The only option that matches this date is (D) 07/09/1972.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the options available, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
