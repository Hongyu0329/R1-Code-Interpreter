    "To determine the date one year ago from today, 8/3/1997, we need to subtract one year from the given date. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Date**: The current date is 8/3/1997, which is August 3, 1997.\n\n2. **Subtract One Year**: To find the date one year ago, we subtract one year from the year 1997. This gives us the year 1996.\n\n3. **Maintain the Same Month and Day**: Since we are only subtracting a year, the month and day remain the same. Therefore, the month is still August (08), and the day is still the 3rd (03).\n\n4. **Construct the Date**: Combining the results from the above steps, the date one year ago from 8/3/1997 is 8/3/1996.\n\n5. **Match with the Options**: Now, we compare this date with the given options:\n   - (A) 10/07/1996\n   - (B) 08/03/2035\n   - (C) 05/03/1997\n   - (D) 08/03/1996\n   - (E) 08/04/1996\n\n   The date 8/3/1996 matches option (D).\n\nTherefore, the date one year ago from 8/3/1997 is 08/03/1996.\n\n<<<D>>>"
