    "To determine the date today, we need to analyze the information given:\n\n1. **Yesterday's Date**: The problem states that yesterday was 12/31/1929. This is the last day of December and also the last day of the year 1929.\n\n2. **Understanding the Transition**: Since December has only 31 days, the day after 12/31/1929 would be the first day of the next month and the next year. Therefore, the day after 12/31/1929 is 01/01/1930.\n\n3. **Verification with Options**: We need to compare this conclusion with the given options to find the correct answer:\n   - (A) 01/08/1930: This is incorrect because it is 7 days after 01/01/1930.\n   - (B) 01/06/1930: This is incorrect because it is 5 days after 01/01/1930.\n   - (C) 01/01/1930: This matches our conclusion.\n   - (D) 12/31/1929: This is incorrect because it was yesterday's date.\n   - (E) 10/01/1930: This is incorrect because it is much later in the year.\n   - (F) 02/27/1930: This is incorrect because it is in February, not January.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the correct date today is 01/01/1930.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<C>>>."
