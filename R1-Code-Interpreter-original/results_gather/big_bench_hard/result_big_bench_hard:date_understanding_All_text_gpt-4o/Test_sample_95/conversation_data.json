    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one week ago from today, given that today is 3/5 (March 5th) in the year 1973. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Today's Date**: \n   - Today is March 5th, 1973, which is written as 03/05/1973 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week Ago**:\n   - One week consists of 7 days. Therefore, one week ago from March 5th, 1973, would be 7 days before March 5th, 1973.\n\n3. **Subtract 7 Days from March 5th, 1973**:\n   - March 5th minus 7 days takes us back to February 26th, 1973.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - March has 31 days, so moving back 7 days from the 5th of March lands us in the previous month, February.\n   - February 1973 is not a leap year, so it has 28 days.\n   - Counting backwards: March 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st, then February 28th, 27th, and finally 26th.\n\n5. **Match with the Options**:\n   - We need to find the option that matches February 26th, 1973.\n   - Option (E) is 02/26/1973, which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today, March 5th, 1973, is February 26th, 1973.\n\nFinal answer: <<<E>>>."
