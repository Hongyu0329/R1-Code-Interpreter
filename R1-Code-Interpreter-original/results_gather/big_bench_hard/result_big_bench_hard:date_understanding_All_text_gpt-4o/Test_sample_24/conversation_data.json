    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the date format used in the UK and convert it to the format used in the United States.\n\n1. **Understand the UK Date Format**: In the UK, the date format is DD/MM/YYYY. This means the day comes first, followed by the month, and then the year.\n\n2. **Identify Today's Date in UK Format**: The problem states that today is 02/01/1987 in the UK format. This means:\n   - Day: 02\n   - Month: 01 (January)\n   - Year: 1987\n\n3. **Convert to US Date Format**: In the US, the date format is MM/DD/YYYY. Therefore, today's date in the US format would be 01/02/1987.\n\n4. **Determine Yesterday's Date**: To find yesterday's date, we need to subtract one day from today's date (01/02/1987).\n\n5. **Subtract One Day**: \n   - Since today is January 2nd, 1987, subtracting one day would take us to January 1st, 1987.\n\n6. **Convert Yesterday's Date to US Format**: \n   - Yesterday's date in the US format is 01/01/1987.\n\n7. **Match with Given Options**: \n   - We need to find the option that matches 01/01/1987.\n\n8. **Check the Options**:\n   - (A) 01/01/1987\n   - (B) 10/19/1986\n   - (C) 01/08/1987\n   - (D) 01/01/2015\n   - (E) 01/01/1934\n   - (F) 12/29/1986\n\n9. **Select the Correct Option**: \n   - The correct option is (A) 01/01/1987.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
