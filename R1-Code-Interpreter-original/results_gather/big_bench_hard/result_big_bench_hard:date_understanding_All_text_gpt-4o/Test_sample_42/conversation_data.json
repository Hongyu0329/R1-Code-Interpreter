    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date that is ten years after May 6, 1992, and then find the date of the following day.\n\n1. **Identify the starting date:** The problem states that May 6, 1992, is like yesterday to Jane, but it is actually ten years ago. This means we need to calculate the date ten years after May 6, 1992.\n\n2. **Calculate ten years after May 6, 1992:** \n   - Starting date: May 6, 1992\n   - Add ten years: May 6, 1992 + 10 years = May 6, 2002\n\n3. **Determine the date of the following day:** \n   - The day after May 6, 2002, is May 7, 2002.\n\n4. **Match the calculated date with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) 04/16/2002: This is not the correct date.\n   - Option (B) 04/07/2003: This is not the correct date.\n   - Option (C) 05/07/2036: This is not the correct date.\n   - Option (D) 05/28/2002: This is not the correct date.\n   - Option (E) 05/07/2002: This matches the calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date tomorrow, ten years after May 6, 1992, is May 7, 2002.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<E>>>."
