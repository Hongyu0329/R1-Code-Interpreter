    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct date for \"yesterday\" based on the information given.\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Date:**\n   - Jane thinks today is 6/18/2019.\n   - John thinks today is 6/19/2019.\n   - We are told that Jane is correct.\n\n2. **Determine Yesterday's Date:**\n   - Since Jane is correct, today is 6/18/2019.\n   - Therefore, yesterday would be one day before 6/18/2019.\n\n3. **Calculate Yesterday's Date:**\n   - One day before 6/18/2019 is 6/17/2019.\n\n4. **Match with the Given Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches 6/17/2019.\n   - Option (D) is 06/17/2019, which matches our calculated date.\n\n5. **Verify Other Options:**\n   - Option (A) 06/17/2063 is incorrect because the year is 2063.\n   - Option (B) 05/18/2019 is incorrect because the month is May.\n   - Option (C) 05/20/2019 is incorrect because the month is May.\n   - Option (E) 05/13/2019 is incorrect because the month is May.\n   - Option (F) 06/08/2019 is incorrect because the day is 08.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only option that matches the calculated date of 6/17/2019 is Option (D).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
