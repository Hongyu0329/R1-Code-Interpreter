    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current date based on the information given and then calculate the date one week ago from today.\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Information:**\n   - We are told that it was September 1st, 2021, a week ago. This means that one week before today, the date was September 1st, 2021.\n\n2. **Calculating Today's Date:**\n   - If one week ago was September 1st, 2021, then today must be one week after that date.\n   - Adding 7 days to September 1st, 2021, gives us September 8th, 2021.\n\n3. **Finding the Date One Week Ago from Today:**\n   - Now that we know today is September 8th, 2021, we need to find the date one week ago from today.\n   - Subtracting 7 days from September 8th, 2021, brings us back to September 1st, 2021.\n\n4. **Matching with the Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches the date we calculated, which is September 1st, 2021.\n   - The format required is MM/DD/YYYY, so September 1st, 2021, is written as 09/01/2021.\n\n5. **Selecting the Correct Option:**\n   - Among the given options, (C) 09/01/2021 matches the date we calculated.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
