    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date one month before January 2, 1987, and then convert it to the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n1. **Understand the UK Date Format**: In the UK, the date format is DD/MM/YYYY. Therefore, 02/01/1987 means January 2, 1987.\n\n2. **Determine the Date One Month Ago**: \n   - From January 2, 1987, one month ago would be December 2, 1986. This is because moving one month back from January takes us to December of the previous year.\n\n3. **Convert to MM/DD/YYYY Format**: \n   - The date December 2, 1986, in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/02/1986.\n\n4. **Match with the Given Options**: \n   - We need to find the option that matches 12/02/1986. \n   - Option (A) is 12/02/1986, which matches our calculated date.\n\n5. **Verify Other Options**: \n   - Option (B) is 12/01/1986, which is incorrect because it represents December 1, not December 2.\n   - Option (C) is 03/02/1986, which is incorrect because it represents March 2, 1986.\n   - Option (D) is 12/02/2032, which is incorrect because the year is 2032, not 1986.\n   - Option (E) is 12/02/2062, which is incorrect because the year is 2062, not 1986.\n   - Option (F) is 02/06/1987, which is incorrect because it represents February 6, 1987.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
