    "To determine the date of the day after the last day of 1899, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Last Day of 1899**: \n   - The year 1899 is a common year, not a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. Since 1899 is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.\n   - Therefore, December 31, 1899, is the last day of the year.\n\n2. **Determine the Date of the Next Day**:\n   - The day after December 31, 1899, is the first day of the next year.\n   - The next year after 1899 is 1900.\n\n3. **Format the Date**:\n   - The date format required is MM/DD/YYYY.\n   - The first day of the year 1900 is January 1, 1900.\n   - In MM/DD/YYYY format, this is written as 01/01/1900.\n\n4. **Match with the Given Options**:\n   - We need to find the option that matches 01/01/1900.\n   - Option (A) is 01/01/1900, which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format is:\n\n<<<01/01/1900>>>"
