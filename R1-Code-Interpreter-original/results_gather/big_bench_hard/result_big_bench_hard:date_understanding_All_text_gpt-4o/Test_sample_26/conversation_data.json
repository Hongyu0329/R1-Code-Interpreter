    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current date based on the given deadline and then calculate the date one week ago from today.\n\n1. **Identify the Deadline Date:**\n   - The deadline is given as June 1, 2021.\n\n2. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - The problem states that the deadline is 2 days away from now. Therefore, today's date is 2 days before June 1, 2021.\n   - Calculating 2 days before June 1, 2021, we get May 30, 2021.\n\n3. **Calculate the Date One Week Ago:**\n   - One week ago from today (May 30, 2021) is 7 days before May 30, 2021.\n   - Subtracting 7 days from May 30, 2021, we get May 23, 2021.\n\n4. **Match the Calculated Date with the Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches the date May 23, 2021.\n   - Option (F) is 05/23/2021, which matches the calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today is May 23, 2021.\n\nFinal answer: <<<F>>>."
