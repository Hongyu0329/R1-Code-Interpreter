    "To determine the date of the day before September 9, 1909, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Date Format**: The date format required is MM/DD/YYYY, which stands for Month/Day/Year.\n\n2. **Identify the Current Date**: The current date given is September 9, 1909, which is written as 09/09/1909 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n3. **Determine the Previous Day**: To find the date of the previous day, we need to subtract one day from the current date.\n\n4. **Consider the Month and Year**: Since September 9, 1909, is not the first day of the month, we only need to subtract one day from the day component. There is no need to change the month or year.\n\n5. **Calculate the Previous Day**: Subtracting one day from September 9, 1909, results in September 8, 1909. In MM/DD/YYYY format, this is 09/08/1909.\n\n6. **Match with the Options**: We need to find the option that matches the calculated date:\n   - (A) 08/11/1909\n   - (B) 07/24/1909\n   - (C) 09/09/1909\n   - (D) 09/08/1962\n   - (E) 09/08/1909\n   - (F) 09/15/1909\n\n7. **Select the Correct Option**: The correct date, 09/08/1909, matches option (E).\n\nTherefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
