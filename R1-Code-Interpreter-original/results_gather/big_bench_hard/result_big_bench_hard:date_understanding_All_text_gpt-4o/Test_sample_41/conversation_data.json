    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct date one week from the date John believes it is, which is 6/19/2019. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Date:**\n   - John thinks today is 6/19/2019, and he is correct. Therefore, the current date is 6/19/2019.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week from the Correct Date:**\n   - One week from a given date is simply 7 days later.\n   - Starting from 6/19/2019, we add 7 days.\n\n3. **Add 7 Days to 6/19/2019:**\n   - 6/19/2019 + 7 days = 6/26/2019.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Start from June 19th and count each day:\n     - June 20th\n     - June 21st\n     - June 22nd\n     - June 23rd\n     - June 24th\n     - June 25th\n     - June 26th\n   - The 7th day is June 26th, 2019.\n\n5. **Match the Result with the Given Options:**\n   - The calculated date, 6/26/2019, matches option (E).\n\nTherefore, the date one week from today, given that today is 6/19/2019, is 6/26/2019.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<E>>>."
