    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in the US for the year 2001 and then calculate the date exactly one month prior to that.\n\n1. **Understand Thanksgiving Date Rule**: In the US, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\n2. **Identify the Date of Thanksgiving 2001**:\n   - November 1, 2001, was a Thursday.\n   - Therefore, the Thursdays in November 2001 were on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th.\n   - The fourth Thursday of November 2001 was on the 22nd.\n\n3. **Calculate One Month Prior**:\n   - One month before November 22, 2001, is October 22, 2001.\n\n4. **Match with Given Options**:\n   - We need to find the option that matches October 22, 2001.\n   - The options provided are:\n     - (A) 11/22/2001\n     - (B) 10/21/2002\n     - (C) 07/21/2002\n     - (D) 10/22/1923\n     - (E) 10/15/2002\n     - (F) 10/22/2002\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the options directly match October 22, 2001.\n   - However, the closest match in terms of month and day is option (F) 10/22/2002, but the year is incorrect.\n   - Since none of the options match the calculated date, it seems there might be an error in the options provided.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct date a month ago from Thanksgiving 2001 is October 22, 2001, but it is not listed in the options. Therefore, based on the closest match in terms of month and day, the answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
