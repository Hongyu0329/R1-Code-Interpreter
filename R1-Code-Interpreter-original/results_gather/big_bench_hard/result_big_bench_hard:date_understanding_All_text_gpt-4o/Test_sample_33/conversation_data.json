    "To determine the date one week ago from today, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Today's Date**: \n   - Today is the second day of the third month of 1966, which translates to March 2, 1966, or 03/02/1966.\n\n2. **Calculate One Week Ago**:\n   - One week consists of 7 days. Therefore, to find the date one week ago, we subtract 7 days from March 2, 1966.\n\n3. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - Subtracting 7 days from March 2, 1966, we get February 23, 1966. This is because February has 28 days in 1966 (1966 is not a leap year).\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Start from March 2, 1966, and count backwards:\n     - March 1, 1966\n     - February 28, 1966\n     - February 27, 1966\n     - February 26, 1966\n     - February 25, 1966\n     - February 24, 1966\n     - February 23, 1966\n\n5. **Match with the Options**:\n   - The calculated date, February 23, 1966, matches option (F).\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from today is February 23, 1966.\n\nFinal answer: <<<F>>>."
