    "To determine the date 24 hours after the last day of January 2012, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Last Day of January 2012:**\n   - January has 31 days, so the last day of January 2012 is January 31, 2012.\n\n2. **Calculate 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Adding 24 hours to January 31, 2012, means moving to the next day, which is February 1, 2012.\n\n3. **Verify the Year:**\n   - Since we are moving from January to February within the same year, the year remains 2012.\n\n4. **Format the Date:**\n   - The date 24 hours after January 31, 2012, is February 1, 2012, which is formatted as 02/01/2012 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n5. **Match with Given Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches 02/01/2012.\n   - Option (F) is 02/01/2012, which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (F).\n\n<<<F>>>"
