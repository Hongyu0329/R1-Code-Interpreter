    "To determine the date one week ago from September 9, 1909, we need to subtract 7 days from this date. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Date**: The current date is September 9, 1909.\n\n2. **Subtract 7 Days**: \n   - September 9, 1909, is the 9th day of September.\n   - Subtracting 7 days from the 9th day of September gives us the 2nd day of September.\n\n3. **Determine the Year**: Since we are only subtracting days within the same month and year, the year remains 1909.\n\n4. **Determine the Month**: Since we are still within the month of September after subtracting 7 days, the month remains September.\n\n5. **Format the Date**: The date one week ago is September 2, 1909. In MM/DD/YYYY format, this is 09/02/1909.\n\n6. **Match with Options**: We need to find the option that matches the calculated date:\n   - Option (A) 09/02/1832\n   - Option (B) 05/02/1909\n   - Option (C) 09/02/1864\n   - Option (D) 09/02/1906\n   - Option (E) 09/02/1909\n   - Option (F) 08/19/1909\n\n   The correct match is Option (E) 09/02/1909.\n\nTherefore, the date one week ago from September 9, 1909, is 09/02/1909.\n\nFinal answer: <<<E>>>."
