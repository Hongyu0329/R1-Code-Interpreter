    "To determine the date 10 days ago from 9/7, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Date**: The current date given is 9/7. Since no year is specified, we assume the year is the same as the event Jane is watching, which is NFL 2003. Therefore, the current date is 09/07/2003.\n\n2. **Calculate 10 Days Ago**: We need to subtract 10 days from 09/07/2003.\n\n3. **Subtract Days**: \n   - Start from 09/07/2003.\n   - Subtract 7 days to reach 09/01/2003.\n   - Subtract the remaining 3 days to reach 08/29/2003.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - From 09/07/2003, subtracting 7 days takes us to 09/01/2003.\n   - Subtracting 3 more days from 09/01/2003 results in 08/29/2003.\n\n5. **Match with Options**: \n   - Option (B) is 08/29/2003, which matches our calculated date.\n\nTherefore, the date 10 days ago from 09/07/2003 is 08/29/2003.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B>>>."
