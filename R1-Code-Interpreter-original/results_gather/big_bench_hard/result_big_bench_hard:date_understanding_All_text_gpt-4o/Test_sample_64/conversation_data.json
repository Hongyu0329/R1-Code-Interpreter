    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the date of Jane's 16th birthday and then find the date of the following day.\n\n1. **Identify Jane's Birth Date:**\n   - Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000.\n   - The year 2000 is a leap year (divisible by 4 and 400), so February has 29 days.\n   - Therefore, Jane's birth date is February 29, 2000.\n\n2. **Determine Jane's 16th Birthday:**\n   - Jane's 16th birthday would be 16 years after her birth date.\n   - Adding 16 years to February 29, 2000, we get February 29, 2016.\n   - The year 2016 is also a leap year, so February 29 exists in 2016.\n\n3. **Find the Date of the Following Day:**\n   - The day after February 29, 2016, is March 1, 2016.\n\n4. **Match the Date with the Given Options:**\n   - We need to find the option that matches March 1, 2016.\n   - Option (D) is 03/01/2016, which matches the date we calculated.\n\nTherefore, the date tomorrow is March 1, 2016.\n\nFinal answer: <<<D>>>"
