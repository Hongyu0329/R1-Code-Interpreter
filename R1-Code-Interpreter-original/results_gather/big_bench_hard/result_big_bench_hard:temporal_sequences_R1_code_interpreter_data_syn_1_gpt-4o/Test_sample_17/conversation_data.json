    "To determine when Jessica could have gone to the beach, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and identify any gaps where she was not seen by anyone.\n\n1. Jessica woke up at 5am.\n2. Emily saw Jessica at the yoga studio from 5am to 8am.\n3. Thomas saw Jessica near the Eiffel Tower from 8am to 9am.\n4. Richard saw Jessica at the electronic store from 12pm to 3pm.\n5. Kimberly saw Jessica at the theater from 3pm to 7pm.\n6. Sarah saw Jessica driving to the water park from 7pm to 10pm.\n7. The beach was closed after 10pm.\n\nNow, let's identify the gaps in this timeline:\n\n- From 5am to 8am, Jessica was at the yoga studio.\n- From 8am to 9am, Jessica was near the Eiffel Tower.\n- From 12pm to 3pm, Jessica was at the electronic store.\n- From 3pm to 7pm, Jessica was at the theater.\n- From 7pm to 10pm, Jessica was driving to the water park.\n\nThe only gap in the timeline where Jessica was not seen by anyone is from 9am to 12pm. This is the only time she could have gone to the beach.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) 9am to 12pm.\n\n<<<C) 9am to 12pm>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, Jessica went to the beach.
