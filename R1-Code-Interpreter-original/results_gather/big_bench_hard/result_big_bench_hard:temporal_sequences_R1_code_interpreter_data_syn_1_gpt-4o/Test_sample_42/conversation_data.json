    "To determine when David could have gone to the museum, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the museum's closing time.\n\n1. David woke up at 8am.\n2. From 10am to 11am, David was seen playing tennis.\n3. From 11am to 4pm, David was seen stretching at a yoga studio.\n4. From 4pm to 5pm, David was seen working out at the gym.\n5. From 5pm to 6pm, David was seen buying lunch at the deli.\n6. The museum was closed after 6pm.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n- (A) 8am to 10am: David was not seen by anyone during this time, so he could have gone to the museum.\n- (B) 11am to 4pm: David was seen at the yoga studio, so he could not have gone to the museum.\n- (C) 10am to 11am: David was seen playing tennis, so he could not have gone to the museum.\n- (D) 5pm to 6pm: David was seen buying lunch, so he could not have gone to the museum.\n\nThe only time David was not accounted for and the museum was open is from 8am to 10am.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, David went to the museum.
