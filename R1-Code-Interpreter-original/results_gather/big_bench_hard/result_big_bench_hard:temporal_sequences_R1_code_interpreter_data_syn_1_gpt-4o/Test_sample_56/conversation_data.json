    "To determine when David could have gone to the swimming pool, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities:\n\n1. David woke up at 9am.\n2. From 9am to 10am, Kimberly saw David working out at the gym.\n3. From 11am to 12pm, Michael saw David watching a movie at the theater.\n4. From 12pm to 1pm, Jennifer saw David attending class at the school.\n5. From 1pm to 2pm, Jason saw David buying a phone at the electronics store.\n6. From 2pm to 10pm, William saw David sitting on a rooftop.\n7. The swimming pool was closed after 10pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- (A) 10am to 11am: This is a possible time slot because there is no record of David's activities during this period.\n- (B) 12pm to 1pm: This is not possible because David was attending class at the school during this time.\n- (C) 2pm to 10pm: This is not possible because David was seen sitting on a rooftop during this time.\n- (D) 9am to 10am: This is not possible because David was working out at the gym during this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time slot when David could have gone to the swimming pool is from 10am to 11am.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, David went to the swimming pool.
