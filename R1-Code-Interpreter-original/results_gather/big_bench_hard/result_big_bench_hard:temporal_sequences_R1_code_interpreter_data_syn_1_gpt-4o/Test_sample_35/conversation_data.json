    "To determine when David could have gone to the dance studio, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities:\n\n1. David woke up at 5am.\n2. From 5am to 8am, Betty saw David playing tennis.\n3. From 8am to 11am, Anthony saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty.\n4. From 12pm to 5pm, Lisa saw David taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.\n5. The dance studio was closed after 5pm.\n\nGiven these observations, we need to find a time slot when David was not seen by anyone and the dance studio was open. The only time slot that fits these criteria is between 11am and 12pm. During this time, David was not seen by anyone, and the dance studio was open.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) 11am to 12pm.\n\n<<<B) 11am to 12pm>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, David went to the dance studio.
