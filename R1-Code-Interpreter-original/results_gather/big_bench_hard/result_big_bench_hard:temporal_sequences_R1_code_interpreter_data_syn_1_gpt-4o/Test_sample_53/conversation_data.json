    "To determine when Thomas could have gone to the physics classroom, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities throughout the day:\n\n1. Thomas woke up at 6am.\n2. From 12pm to 1pm, Thomas was seen playing tennis.\n3. From 1pm to 3pm, Thomas was seen sitting on a rooftop.\n4. From 3pm to 7pm, Thomas was seen working out at the gym.\n5. From 7pm to 10pm, Thomas was seen buying a bike at the bike shop.\n6. The physics classroom was closed after 10pm.\n\nGiven these observations, we need to find a time slot when Thomas was not seen elsewhere and could have gone to the physics classroom. The only time slot not accounted for by the observations is from 6am to 12pm.\n\nLet's verify this by checking each option:\n\n- (A) 6am to 12pm: Thomas was not seen elsewhere during this time.\n- (B) 12pm to 1pm: Thomas was playing tennis.\n- (C) 3pm to 7pm: Thomas was working out at the gym.\n- (D) 7pm to 10pm: Thomas was buying a bike.\n\nTherefore, the only viable option is (A) 6am to 12pm.\n\n<<<(A) 6am to 12pm>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, Thomas went to the physics classroom.
