    "To determine when Andrew could have gone to the art studio, we need to analyze the timeline of events and the constraints provided:\n\n1. Andrew woke up at 8am.\n2. Richard saw Andrew at the electronics store from 8am to 10am.\n3. Samantha saw Andrew at the electronics store from 10am to 2pm.\n4. Michael saw Andrew at the library from 3pm to 4pm.\n5. Sarah saw Andrew at the deli from 4pm to 6pm.\n6. The art studio was closed after 6pm.\n\nLet's break down the available time slots:\n\n- From 8am to 10am, Andrew was at the electronics store.\n- From 10am to 2pm, Andrew was still at the electronics store.\n- From 3pm to 4pm, Andrew was at the library.\n- From 4pm to 6pm, Andrew was at the deli.\n- The art studio was closed after 6pm.\n\nThe only time slot not accounted for is between 2pm and 3pm. During this time, Andrew was not seen by anyone, and the art studio was open. Therefore, the only possible time Andrew could have gone to the art studio is between 2pm and 3pm.\n\nThus, the correct option is (B) 2pm to 3pm.\n\n<<<B) 2pm to 3pm>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, Andrew went to the art studio.
