    "To determine when Betty could have gone to the dance studio, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities based on the information provided:\n\n1. Betty woke up at 7am.\n2. Samantha saw Betty getting a coffee at the cafe from 7am to 9am.\n3. Leslie saw Betty waiting at the airport from 9am to 2pm.\n4. Susan saw Betty working at the office from 5pm to 6pm.\n5. Richard saw Betty waiting at the train station from 6pm to 8pm.\n6. The dance studio was closed after 8pm.\n\nWe need to find a time slot when Betty was not seen by anyone and the dance studio was open. The dance studio is open until 8pm, so any time after 8pm is not possible.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n- (A) 2pm to 5pm: This time slot is not covered by any of the sightings, so it is a possible time for Betty to have gone to the dance studio.\n- (B) 7am to 9am: Betty was seen getting coffee during this time, so this is not possible.\n- (C) 5pm to 6pm: Betty was seen working at the office during this time, so this is not possible.\n- (D) 9am to 2pm: Betty was seen at the airport during this time, so this is not possible.\n\nThe only time slot when Betty was not seen by anyone and the dance studio was open is from 2pm to 5pm.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, Betty went to the dance studio.
