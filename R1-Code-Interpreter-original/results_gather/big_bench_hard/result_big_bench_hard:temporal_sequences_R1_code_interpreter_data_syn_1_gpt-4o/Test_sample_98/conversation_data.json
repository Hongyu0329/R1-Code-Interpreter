    "To determine when Ashley could have gone to the basketball court, we need to analyze the timeline of Ashley's activities:\n\n1. Ashley woke up at 9am.\n2. From 9am to 10am, John saw Ashley taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.\n3. From 10am to 1pm, Linda saw Ashley walking in the garden.\n4. From 1pm to 2pm, Ashley was attending class at the school.\n5. The basketball court was closed after 7pm.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From 9am to 10am, Ashley was taking photos, so they couldn't have been at the basketball court.\n- From 10am to 1pm, Ashley was walking in the garden, so they couldn't have been at the basketball court.\n- From 1pm to 2pm, Ashley was attending class, so they couldn't have been at the basketball court.\n- The basketball court was closed after 7pm, so Ashley couldn't have gone after that time.\n\nTherefore, the only available time for Ashley to have gone to the basketball court is between 2pm and 7pm.\n\nThe correct option is (A) 2pm to 7pm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
