    "To determine when Susan could have gone to the restaurant, we need to analyze her schedule and identify any free time slots that align with the restaurant's operating hours.\n\n1. Susan woke up at 11am.\n2. From 11am to 1pm, Lisa saw Susan taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n3. From 1pm to 3pm, William saw Susan buying cookies at a bakery.\n4. From 3pm to 6pm, Jennifer saw Susan working at the office.\n5. From 6pm to 7pm, Jason saw Susan walking towards the Statue of Liberty.\n6. From 7pm to 9pm, Ashley saw Susan waiting at the airport.\n7. The restaurant was closed after 10pm.\n\nGiven this schedule, we need to find a time slot when Susan was not seen by anyone and the restaurant was open. The restaurant is open until 10pm, so any time slot after 10pm is not possible.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n- (A) 6pm to 7pm: Susan was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty.\n- (B) 9pm to 10pm: This is a potential free time slot since Susan was last seen at the airport from 7pm to 9pm, and the restaurant is open until 10pm.\n- (C) 11am to 1pm: Susan was seen taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n- (D) 7pm to 9pm: Susan was seen waiting at the airport.\n\nThe only time slot when Susan was not seen by anyone and the restaurant was open is from 9pm to 10pm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
