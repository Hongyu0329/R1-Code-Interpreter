    "To determine when Tiffany could have gone to the library, we need to analyze her schedule based on the information provided:\n\n1. Tiffany woke up at 5am.\n2. Anthony saw Tiffany walking in the garden from 6am to 8am.\n3. Emily saw Tiffany working out at the gym from 8am to 5pm.\n4. Kimberly saw Tiffany working at the office from 5pm to 7pm.\n5. Thomas saw Tiffany playing tennis at the tennis court from 7pm to 8pm.\n6. The library was closed after 8pm.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 8am to 5pm**: Tiffany was seen working out at the gym during this entire period, so she couldn't have gone to the library.\n- **Option (B) 5am to 6am**: Tiffany woke up at 5am, and there is no other activity mentioned during this time. Therefore, she could have gone to the library.\n- **Option (C) 7pm to 8pm**: Tiffany was seen playing tennis during this time, so she couldn't have gone to the library.\n- **Option (D) 6am to 8am**: Tiffany was seen walking in the garden during this time, so she couldn't have gone to the library.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only time Tiffany could have gone to the library is between 5am and 6am.\n\n<<<(B) 5am to 6am>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, Tiffany went to the library.
