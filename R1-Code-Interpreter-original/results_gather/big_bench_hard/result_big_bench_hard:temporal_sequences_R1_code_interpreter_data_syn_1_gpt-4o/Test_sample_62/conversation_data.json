    "To determine when Andrew could have gone to the dance studio, we need to analyze the given information and eliminate the times when Andrew was seen elsewhere.\n\n1. Andrew woke up at 8am.\n2. Thomas saw Andrew playing tennis from 8am to 11am.\n3. Mary saw Andrew reading at the library from 11am to 1pm.\n4. Michael saw Andrew fixing their computer from 8pm to 10pm.\n5. The dance studio was closed after 10pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A) 8pm to 10pm**: Andrew was seen fixing their computer during this time, so this option is not possible.\n- **Option (B) 11am to 1pm**: Andrew was seen reading at the library during this time, so this option is not possible.\n- **Option (C) 8am to 11am**: Andrew was seen playing tennis during this time, so this option is not possible.\n- **Option (D) 1pm to 8pm**: Andrew is not accounted for during this time, so this is the only possible time frame when Andrew could have gone to the dance studio.\n\nTherefore, the only time Andrew could have gone to the dance studio is between 1pm and 8pm.\n\n<<<D) 1pm to 8pm>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, Andrew went to the dance studio.
