    "To determine when Betty could have gone to the bookstore, we need to analyze the timeline of her activities and identify any gaps where she was not seen by anyone.\n\n1. **8am to 10am**: Betty was seen by Nancy at the airport.\n2. **10am to 2pm**: Betty was seen by Tiffany at the yoga studio.\n3. **2pm to 4pm**: Betty was seen by James at the library.\n4. **4pm to 5pm**: Betty was seen by Steven at the bike shop.\n5. **5pm to 6pm**: Betty was seen by Mary near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n6. **After 8pm**: The bookstore is closed.\n\nThe only time slot not covered by these observations is **6pm to 8pm**. During this time, Betty was not seen by anyone, and the bookstore was still open.\n\nTherefore, the only possible time Betty could have gone to the bookstore is between 6pm and 8pm.\n\n<<<D) 6pm to 8pm>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, Betty went to the bookstore.
