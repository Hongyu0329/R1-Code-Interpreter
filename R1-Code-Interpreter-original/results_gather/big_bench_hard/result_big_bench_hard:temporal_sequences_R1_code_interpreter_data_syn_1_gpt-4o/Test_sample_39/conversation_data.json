    "To determine when Andrew could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to analyze the timeline of events and the constraints provided:\n\n1. Andrew woke up at 8am.\n2. Elizabeth saw Andrew at the electronic store from 11am to 3pm.\n3. Jennifer saw Andrew at the bike shop from 3pm to 4pm.\n4. Anthony saw Andrew at the bakery from 4pm to 6pm.\n5. Betty saw Andrew at the theater from 6pm to 8pm.\n6. The coffee shop was closed after 8pm.\n\nGiven these constraints, we need to find a time slot when Andrew was not seen by anyone else and the coffee shop was open. Let's evaluate the options:\n\n- (A) 3pm to 4pm: Andrew was seen at the bike shop during this time.\n- (B) 6pm to 8pm: Andrew was seen at the theater during this time.\n- (C) 8am to 11am: Andrew was not seen by anyone during this time, and the coffee shop was open.\n- (D) 11am to 3pm: Andrew was seen at the electronic store during this time.\n\nThe only time slot when Andrew was not seen by anyone and the coffee shop was open is from 8am to 11am.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) 8am to 11am>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, Andrew went to the coffee shop.
