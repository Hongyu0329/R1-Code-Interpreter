    "To determine when William could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities:\n\n1. William woke up at 6am.\n2. Susan saw William at the library from 6am to 9am.\n3. Linda saw William at the airport from 9am to 3pm.\n4. Mark saw William playing tennis from 4pm to 6pm.\n5. Samantha saw William working at the office from 6pm to 9pm.\n6. Ashley saw William at the gym from 9pm to 10pm.\n7. The coffee shop was closed after 10pm.\n\nWe need to find a time slot when William was not seen by anyone and the coffee shop was open. The only gap in William's schedule is between 3pm and 4pm, as he was seen at the airport until 3pm and then at the tennis court from 4pm.\n\nLet's verify this by checking the options:\n\n- (A) 3pm to 4pm: This is the only time slot when William was not seen by anyone.\n- (B) 4pm to 6pm: William was playing tennis.\n- (C) 6pm to 9pm: William was working at the office.\n- (D) 9am to 3pm: William was at the airport.\n\nTherefore, the only possible time William could have gone to the coffee shop is between 3pm and 4pm.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, William went to the coffee shop.
