    "To determine when Mark could have gone to the art show, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities throughout the day:\n\n1. Mark woke up at 10am.\n2. From 10am to 11am, Mark was seen buying a bike at the bike shop.\n3. From 1pm to 2pm, Mark was seen watching a movie at the theater.\n4. From 2pm to 4pm, Mark was seen working out at the gym.\n5. From 4pm to 9pm, Mark was seen buying a phone at the electronics store.\n6. From 9pm to 10pm, Mark was seen waiting at the airport.\n7. The art show was closed after 10pm.\n\nGiven these observations, we need to find a time slot when Mark was not seen by anyone and the art show was open. The art show must have been open before 10pm, as it closed after 10pm.\n\nLet's analyze the gaps between these activities:\n\n- From 11am to 1pm, there is a gap where Mark is not accounted for.\n- From 10am to 11am, Mark was buying a bike.\n- From 2pm to 4pm, Mark was working out.\n- From 4pm to 9pm, Mark was buying a phone.\n- From 9pm to 10pm, Mark was at the airport.\n\nThe only gap where Mark is not accounted for and the art show could be open is from 11am to 1pm.\n\nTherefore, the time slot when Mark could have gone to the art show is from 11am to 1pm.\n\nThe correct option is (A) 11am to 1pm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
