    "To determine when Anthony could have gone to the orchestra hall, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities and the constraints provided:\n\n1. Anthony woke up at 6am.\n2. From 6am to 12pm, Anthony was seen stretching at a yoga studio.\n3. From 12pm to 2pm, Anthony was seen driving to the water park.\n4. From 2pm to 3pm, Anthony was seen watching a movie at the theater.\n5. From 5pm to 6pm, Anthony was seen fixing a computer at the electronic store.\n6. From 6pm to 7pm, Anthony was seen reading at the library.\n7. The orchestra hall was closed after 7pm.\n\nGiven these observations, we need to find a time slot when Anthony was not seen elsewhere and the orchestra hall was open. The only time slot that fits these criteria is between 3pm and 5pm, as Anthony was not seen by anyone during this period, and the orchestra hall was open.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the options:\n\n- (A) 12pm to 2pm: Anthony was seen driving to the water park.\n- (B) 6pm to 7pm: Anthony was seen reading at the library.\n- (C) 3pm to 5pm: Anthony was not seen by anyone, and the orchestra hall was open.\n- (D) 2pm to 3pm: Anthony was seen watching a movie at the theater.\n\nTherefore, the only viable option is (C) 3pm to 5pm.\n\n<<<C) 3pm to 5pm>>>"
