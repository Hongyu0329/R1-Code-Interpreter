    "To determine when William could have gone to the art studio, we need to analyze the timeline of his activities:\n\n1. William woke up at 6am.\n2. William was working out at the gym from 6am to 7am.\n3. Sean saw William taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 12pm.\n4. Susan saw William working at the office from 12pm to 8pm.\n5. Nancy saw William buying a bike at the bike shop from 8pm to 10pm.\n6. The art studio was closed after 10pm.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- (A) 8pm to 10pm: William was seen buying a bike at the bike shop during this time.\n- (B) 9am to 12pm: William was seen taking photos near the Eiffel Tower during this time.\n- (C) 6am to 7am: William was working out at the gym during this time.\n- (D) 7am to 9am: This is the only time slot not accounted for by any of the activities mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the only time William could have gone to the art studio is between 7am and 9am.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Today, William went to the art studio.
