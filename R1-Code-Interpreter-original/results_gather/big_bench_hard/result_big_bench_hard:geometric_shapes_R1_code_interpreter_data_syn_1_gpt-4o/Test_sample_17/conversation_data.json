    "To determine the shape drawn by the given SVG path element, we need to analyze the sequence of commands and coordinates in the path data. The path data consists of a series of commands and coordinates that describe the shape.\n\nThe path data is:\n```\nM 55.55,71.33 L 51.11,64.45 L 42.82,59.85 L 51.86,58.44 M 51.86,58.44 L 52.09,49.14 M 52.09,49.14 L 58.23,50.71 M 58.23,50.71 L 62.67,57.59 M 62.67,57.59 L 62.43,66.89 M 62.43,66.89 L 55.55,71.33\n```\n\nLet's break down the path data:\n- `M` indicates a \"move to\" command, which sets the starting point of the path.\n- `L` indicates a \"line to\" command, which draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\nThe path can be broken down into segments:\n1. Move to (55.55, 71.33)\n2. Line to (51.11, 64.45)\n3. Line to (42.82, 59.85)\n4. Line to (51.86, 58.44)\n5. Move to (51.86, 58.44)\n6. Line to (52.09, 49.14)\n7. Line to (58.23, 50.71)\n8. Line to (62.67, 57.59)\n9. Line to (62.43, 66.89)\n10. Line to (55.55, 71.33)\n\nThe path consists of two separate sub-paths:\n- The first sub-path is a closed shape with vertices at (55.55, 71.33), (51.11, 64.45), (42.82, 59.85), and (51.86, 58.44).\n- The second sub-path is a closed shape with vertices at (51.86, 58.44), (52.09, 49.14), (58.23, 50.71), (62.67, 57.59), (62.43, 66.89), and (55.55, 71.33).\n\nThe first sub-path is a quadrilateral, and the second sub-path is a hexagon. However, the overall shape is determined by the second sub-path, which is a hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the shape drawn by the SVG path element is a hexagon.\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This SVG path element <path d=\"M 55.55,71.33 L 51.11,64.45 L 42.82,59.85 L 51.86,58.44 M 51.86,58.44 L 52.09,49.14 M 52.09,49.14 L 58.23,50.71 M 58.23,50.71 L 62.67,57.59 M 62.67,57.59 L 62.43,66.89 M 62.43,66.89 L 55.55,71.33\"/> draws a\nOptions:\n(A) circle\n(B) heptagon\n(C) hexagon\n(D) kite\n(E) line\n(F) octagon\n(G) pentagon\n(H) rectangle\n(I) sector\n(J) triangle\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
