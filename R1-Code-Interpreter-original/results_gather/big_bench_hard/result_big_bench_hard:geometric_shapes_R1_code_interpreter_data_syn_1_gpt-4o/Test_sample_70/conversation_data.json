    "To determine what shape the SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the SVG element. The path data is given as:\n\n```\nM 21.22,43.76 L 13.59,7.93 L 49.15,35.84 M 49.15,35.84 L 21.22,43.76\n```\n\nLet's break down the path data:\n\n1. `M 21.22,43.76`: This command moves the \"pen\" to the starting point (21.22, 43.76).\n2. `L 13.59,7.93`: This command draws a line from the current point (21.22, 43.76) to the point (13.59, 7.93).\n3. `L 49.15,35.84`: This command draws a line from the current point (13.59, 7.93) to the point (49.15, 35.84).\n4. `M 49.15,35.84`: This command moves the \"pen\" to the point (49.15, 35.84) without drawing a line.\n5. `L 21.22,43.76`: This command draws a line from the current point (49.15, 35.84) to the point (21.22, 43.76).\n\nThe path consists of three line segments that connect three points: (21.22, 43.76), (13.59, 7.93), and (49.15, 35.84). The path forms a closed shape with three sides, which is a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a triangle.\n\n<<<triangle>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This SVG path element <path d=\"M 21.22,43.76 L 13.59,7.93 L 49.15,35.84 M 49.15,35.84 L 21.22,43.76\"/> draws a\nOptions:\n(A) circle\n(B) heptagon\n(C) hexagon\n(D) kite\n(E) line\n(F) octagon\n(G) pentagon\n(H) rectangle\n(I) sector\n(J) triangle\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
