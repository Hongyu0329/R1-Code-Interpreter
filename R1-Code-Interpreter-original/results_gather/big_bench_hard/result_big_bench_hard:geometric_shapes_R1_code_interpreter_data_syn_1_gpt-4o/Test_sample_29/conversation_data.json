    "To determine what shape the SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the SVG element. The path data is given as:\n\n`M 73.00,72.00 L 9.00,72.00 L 9.00,37.00 L 73.00,37.00 L 73.00,72.00`\n\nLet's break down the path data:\n\n1. `M 73.00,72.00`: This command moves the \"pen\" to the starting point (73, 72) without drawing anything.\n\n2. `L 9.00,72.00`: This command draws a line from the current point (73, 72) to the point (9, 72).\n\n3. `L 9.00,37.00`: This command draws a line from the current point (9, 72) to the point (9, 37).\n\n4. `L 73.00,37.00`: This command draws a line from the current point (9, 37) to the point (73, 37).\n\n5. `L 73.00,72.00`: This command draws a line from the current point (73, 37) back to the starting point (73, 72), closing the shape.\n\nThe path forms a closed shape with four corners at the points (73, 72), (9, 72), (9, 37), and (73, 37). These points form a rectangle because:\n\n- The lines between (73, 72) and (9, 72), and between (9, 37) and (73, 37) are horizontal and parallel.\n- The lines between (9, 72) and (9, 37), and between (73, 72) and (73, 37) are vertical and parallel.\n- The opposite sides are equal in length.\n\nThus, the shape is a rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<rectangle>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This SVG path element <path d=\"M 73.00,72.00 L 9.00,72.00 L 9.00,37.00 L 73.00,37.00 L 73.00,72.00\"/> draws a\nOptions:\n(A) circle\n(B) heptagon\n(C) hexagon\n(D) kite\n(E) line\n(F) octagon\n(G) pentagon\n(H) rectangle\n(I) sector\n(J) triangle\n(K) trapezoid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
