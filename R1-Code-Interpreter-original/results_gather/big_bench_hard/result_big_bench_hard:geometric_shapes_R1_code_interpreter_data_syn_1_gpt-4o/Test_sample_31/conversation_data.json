    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the `d` attribute. The path data consists of a series of commands and coordinates that describe the shape.\n\nThe path data is: `M 83.17,32.03 L 87.90,19.01 L 76.80,8.19 L 69.67,12.38 L 72.92,22.11 M 72.92,22.11 L 83.17,32.03`\n\nLet's break down the path data:\n\n1. `M 83.17,32.03`: Move to the starting point (83.17, 32.03).\n2. `L 87.90,19.01`: Draw a line to (87.90, 19.01).\n3. `L 76.80,8.19`: Draw a line to (76.80, 8.19).\n4. `L 69.67,12.38`: Draw a line to (69.67, 12.38).\n5. `L 72.92,22.11`: Draw a line to (72.92, 22.11).\n6. `M 72.92,22.11`: Move to (72.92, 22.11) without drawing a line.\n7. `L 83.17,32.03`: Draw a line back to the starting point (83.17, 32.03).\n\nThe path consists of a series of line segments that form a closed shape. To identify the shape, we can count the number of line segments and analyze their arrangement.\n\n- The path starts at (83.17, 32.03) and ends at the same point, indicating a closed shape.\n- There are five line segments connecting the points: (83.17, 32.03) -> (87.90, 19.01) -> (76.80, 8.19) -> (69.67, 12.38) -> (72.92, 22.11) -> (83.17, 32.03).\n\nThe shape formed by these points is a pentagon, as it has five sides.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a pentagon.\n\n<<<pentagon>>>"
