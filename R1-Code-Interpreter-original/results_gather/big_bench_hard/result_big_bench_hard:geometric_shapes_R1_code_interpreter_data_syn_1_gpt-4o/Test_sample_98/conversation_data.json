    "To determine what shape the SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the SVG element. The path data is given as:\n\n```\nM 99.00,97.00 L 10.00,97.00 L 10.00,49.00 L 99.00,49.00 L 99.00,97.00\n```\n\nLet's break down the path commands:\n\n1. `M 99.00,97.00`: Move to the starting point (99, 97).\n2. `L 10.00,97.00`: Draw a line to (10, 97).\n3. `L 10.00,49.00`: Draw a line to (10, 49).\n4. `L 99.00,49.00`: Draw a line to (99, 49).\n5. `L 99.00,97.00`: Draw a line back to the starting point (99, 97).\n\nThe path consists of four line segments that form a closed shape. The coordinates suggest that the shape is a rectangle because:\n\n- The first and last points are the same, indicating a closed shape.\n- The y-coordinates of the first and second points are the same (97), indicating a horizontal line.\n- The x-coordinates of the second and third points are the same (10), indicating a vertical line.\n- The y-coordinates of the third and fourth points are the same (49), indicating another horizontal line.\n- The x-coordinates of the fourth and first points are the same (99), indicating another vertical line.\n\nThus, the shape is a rectangle.\n\nThe correct option is (H) rectangle.\n\n<<<rectangle>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This SVG path element <path d=\"M 99.00,97.00 L 10.00,97.00 L 10.00,49.00 L 99.00,49.00 L 99.00,97.00\"/> draws a\nOptions:\n(A) circle\n(B) heptagon\n(C) hexagon\n(D) kite\n(E) line\n(F) octagon\n(G) pentagon\n(H) rectangle\n(I) sector\n(J) triangle\n(K) trapezoid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
