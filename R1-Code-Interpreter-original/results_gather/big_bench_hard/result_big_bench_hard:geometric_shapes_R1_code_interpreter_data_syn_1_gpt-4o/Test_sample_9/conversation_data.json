    "To determine what shape the SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the `d` attribute. The path data consists of a series of commands and coordinates that describe the shape.\n\nThe path data is: `M 76.00,30.00 L 58.00,25.00 L 42.00,26.00 L 41.00,41.00 L 47.00,54.00 L 76.00,30.00`\n\nLet's break down the path data:\n\n1. `M 76.00,30.00`: Move to the starting point (76, 30).\n2. `L 58.00,25.00`: Draw a line to (58, 25).\n3. `L 42.00,26.00`: Draw a line to (42, 26).\n4. `L 41.00,41.00`: Draw a line to (41, 41).\n5. `L 47.00,54.00`: Draw a line to (47, 54).\n6. `L 76.00,30.00`: Draw a line back to the starting point (76, 30) to close the shape.\n\nThe path consists of 5 line segments, which means it forms a closed shape with 5 sides. A closed shape with 5 sides is a pentagon.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a pentagon.\n\n<<<G) pentagon>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This SVG path element <path d=\"M 76.00,30.00 L 58.00,25.00 L 42.00,26.00 L 41.00,41.00 L 47.00,54.00 L 76.00,30.00\"/> draws a\nOptions:\n(A) circle\n(B) heptagon\n(C) hexagon\n(D) kite\n(E) line\n(F) octagon\n(G) pentagon\n(H) rectangle\n(I) sector\n(J) triangle\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
