    "To solve the expression `(False or True and not True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not True`: This becomes `False`.\n2. Evaluate `True and False`: Since `and` requires both operands to be `True` for the result to be `True`, this becomes `False`.\n3. Evaluate `False or False`: Since `or` requires at least one operand to be `True` for the result to be `True`, this becomes `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `(False or True and not True)` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False<<<answer>>>"
