    "To solve the expression `False or not False and (False)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, it's just `False`, so it remains `False`.\n\n2. **NOT**: The `not` operator is applied to `False`, which results in `True`.\n\n3. **AND**: Now we have `True and False`. The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n4. **OR**: Finally, we have `False or False`. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False"
