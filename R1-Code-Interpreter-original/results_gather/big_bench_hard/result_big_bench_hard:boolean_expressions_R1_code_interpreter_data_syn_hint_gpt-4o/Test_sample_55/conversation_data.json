    "To solve the expression `(True) and False or not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The expression `(True)` is simply `True`, so it doesn't change anything.\n2. **NOT**: The expression `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n3. **AND**: Now we evaluate `True and False`. This evaluates to `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n4. **OR**: Finally, we evaluate `False or True`. This evaluates to `True` because at least one of the operands is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression `(True) and False or not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
