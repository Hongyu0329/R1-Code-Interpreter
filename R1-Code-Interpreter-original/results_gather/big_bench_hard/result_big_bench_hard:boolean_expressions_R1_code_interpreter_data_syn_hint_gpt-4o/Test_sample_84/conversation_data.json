    "To solve the expression `not False or ( ( False ) )`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:** \n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. \n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `or` operation:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - We have `True or False`.\n   - Since one of the operands is `True`, the result of the `or` operation is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<'True'>>>"
