    "To solve the expression `(not True) and True and False`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **not True**: The `not` operator negates the value of `True`, so `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **False and True**: The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since the first operand is `False`, the result of `False and True` is `False`.\n\n3. **False and False**: Again, using the `and` operator, since the first operand is `False`, the result of `False and False` is `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
