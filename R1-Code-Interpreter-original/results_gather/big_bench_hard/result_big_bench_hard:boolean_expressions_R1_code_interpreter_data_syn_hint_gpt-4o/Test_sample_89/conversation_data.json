    "To solve the expression `False or not False or True and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. Substitute the result back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `False or True or True and True`.\n\n3. Evaluate `True and True`:\n   - `True and True` is `True`.\n\n4. Substitute the result back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `False or True or True`.\n\n5. Evaluate `False or True`:\n   - `False or True` is `True`.\n\n6. Substitute the result back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `True or True`.\n\n7. Evaluate `True or True`:\n   - `True or True` is `True`.\n\nThe final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True<<<answer>>>"
