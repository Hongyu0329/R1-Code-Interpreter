    "To solve the expression `(False and True or not False)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. Now the expression becomes `(False and True or True)`.\n\n3. Evaluate `False and True`: \n   - `False and True` is `False` because both operands need to be `True` for the result to be `True`.\n\n4. Now the expression becomes `(False or True)`.\n\n5. Evaluate `False or True`: \n   - `False or True` is `True` because at least one operand is `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `(False and True or not False)` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
