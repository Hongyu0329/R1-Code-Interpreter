    "To solve the expression `True and (False) or not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, it's just `False`, so it remains `False`.\n\n2. **NOT**: The `not False` part of the expression is evaluated next. `not False` is `True`.\n\n3. **AND**: Now, evaluate the `True and False` part. The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n4. **OR**: Finally, evaluate the `False or True` part. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since one of the operands is `True`, the result is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `True and (False) or not False` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
