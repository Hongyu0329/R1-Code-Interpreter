  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression `(not False) and False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **not False**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. Since `False` is negated, it becomes `True`.\n\n2. **True and False**: The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Here, the first operand is `True` (from the previous step), and the second operand is `False`. Therefore, `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **False or True**: The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Here, the first operand is `False`, and the second operand is `True`. Therefore, `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `(not False) and False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
