    "To solve the expression `(not False and (True))`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step:\n\n1. **not False**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **True and True**: The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. Since both operands here are `True`, the result of the expression is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(not False and (True))` is `True`.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
