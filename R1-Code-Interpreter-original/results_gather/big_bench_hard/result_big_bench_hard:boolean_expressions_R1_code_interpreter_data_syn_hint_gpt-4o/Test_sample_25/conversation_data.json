    "To solve the expression `(False or not False or False)`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **not False**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **False or True or False**: Now, we evaluate the `or` operations. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n\n   - The first part is `False or True`. Since `True` is present, this evaluates to `True`.\n   - Now, we have `True or False`. Again, since `True` is present, this evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression `(False or not False or False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
