    "To solve the expression `True or ( not ( True ) )`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - `not (True)` evaluates to `False` because the `not` operator inverts the boolean value.\n\n2. **Substitute the evaluated expression back**:\n   - The expression now becomes `True or False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operation**:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since the first operand is `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `True or ( not ( True ) )` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
