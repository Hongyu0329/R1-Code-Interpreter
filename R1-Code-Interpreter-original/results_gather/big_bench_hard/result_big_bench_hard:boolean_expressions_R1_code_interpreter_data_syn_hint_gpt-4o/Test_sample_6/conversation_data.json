    "To solve the expression `not True and (False or True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(False or True)`.\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True` because the OR operation returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.\n\n2. Now the expression becomes: `not True and True`.\n\n3. Evaluate the NOT operation: `not True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. Now the expression becomes: `False and True`.\n\n5. Evaluate the AND operation: `False and True`.\n   - `False and True` evaluates to `False` because the AND operation returns `True` only if both operands are `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not True and (False or True)` is `False`.\n\n<<<'False'>>>"
