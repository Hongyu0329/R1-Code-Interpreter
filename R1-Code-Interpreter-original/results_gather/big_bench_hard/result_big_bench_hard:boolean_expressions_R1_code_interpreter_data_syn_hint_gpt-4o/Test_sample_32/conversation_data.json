    "To solve the expression `(True) and True or not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The expression `(True)` is simply `True`, so it doesn't change anything.\n2. **NOT**: Evaluate `not True`, which is `False`.\n3. **AND**: Now evaluate `True and True`, which is `True`.\n4. **OR**: Finally, evaluate `True or False`, which is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
