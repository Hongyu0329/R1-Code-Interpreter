    "To solve the expression `True and not False or (True)`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate any expressions within parentheses first. In this case, `(True)` is simply `True`.\n\n2. **NOT**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value that follows it. Here, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **AND**: The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. We have `True and True` (from the `not False` part), which evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **OR**: The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. We now have `True or True`, which evaluates to `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
