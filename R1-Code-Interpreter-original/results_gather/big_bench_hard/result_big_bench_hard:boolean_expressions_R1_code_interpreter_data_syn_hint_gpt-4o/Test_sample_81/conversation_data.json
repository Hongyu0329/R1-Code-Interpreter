    "To solve the expression `not not not False or False and False`, we need to understand the order of operations for logical operators in Python. The order of precedence is as follows:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not not not False`:**\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n   So, `not not not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `False and False`:**\n   - `False and False` is `False`.\n\n3. **Combine the results with `or`:**\n   - `True or False` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<'True'>>>"
