    "To solve the expression `not False or True and False or False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. Substitute the result back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `True or True and False or False`.\n\n3. Evaluate `True and False`:\n   - `True and False` is `False`.\n\n4. Substitute the result back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `True or False or False`.\n\n5. Evaluate `True or False`:\n   - `True or False` is `True`.\n\n6. Substitute the result back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `True or False`.\n\n7. Evaluate `True or False`:\n   - `True or False` is `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
