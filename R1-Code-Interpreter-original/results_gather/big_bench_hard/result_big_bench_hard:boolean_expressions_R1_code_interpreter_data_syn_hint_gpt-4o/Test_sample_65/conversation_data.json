    "To solve the expression `False or not not not not not False`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding `not` operations**: \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluating the expression**:\n   - Start from the innermost `not` operation: `not False` becomes `True`.\n   - Apply `not` again: `not True` becomes `False`.\n   - Apply `not` again: `not False` becomes `True`.\n   - Apply `not` again: `not True` becomes `False`.\n   - Apply `not` again: `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **Final expression**:\n   - We now have `False or True`.\n\n4. **Logical OR operation**:\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<'True'>>>"
