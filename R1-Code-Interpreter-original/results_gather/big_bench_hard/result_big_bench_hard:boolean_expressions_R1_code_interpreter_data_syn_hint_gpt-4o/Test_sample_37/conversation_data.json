    "To solve the expression `not ( True or True ) and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - `True or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **NOT**: Apply the NOT operator to the result of the parentheses.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **AND**: Finally, evaluate the AND operation with the result from the NOT operation and the remaining part of the expression.\n   - `False and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression `not ( True or True ) and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<'False'>>>"
