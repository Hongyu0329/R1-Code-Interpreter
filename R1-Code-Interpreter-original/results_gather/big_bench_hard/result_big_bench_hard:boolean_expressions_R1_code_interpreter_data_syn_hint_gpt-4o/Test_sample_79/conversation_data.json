    "To solve the expression `(not not True and not False)`, we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not not True`:**\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - Therefore, `not not True` is `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not False`:**\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n3. **Combine the results with `and`:**\n   - We have `True and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `(not not True and not False)` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
