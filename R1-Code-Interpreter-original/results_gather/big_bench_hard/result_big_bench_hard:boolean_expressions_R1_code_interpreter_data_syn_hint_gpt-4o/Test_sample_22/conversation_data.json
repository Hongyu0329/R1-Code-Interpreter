    "To solve the expression `not False or (True) and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. Parentheses `()`\n2. `not`\n3. `and`\n4. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, `(True)` is simply `True`.\n\n2. **Not**: The `not` operator negates the value of `False`, so `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **And**: Now, evaluate the `and` operation. We have `True and True`, which evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. **Or**: Finally, evaluate the `or` operation. We have `True or True`, which evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression `not False or (True) and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True<<<answer>>>"
