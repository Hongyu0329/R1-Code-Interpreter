    "To solve the expression `not not (True) and not False`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - `not not (True)` simplifies to `True` because `not True` is `False`, and `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part**:\n   - `not False` simplifies to `True`.\n\n3. **Combine the results with the `and` operator**:\n   - `True and True` results in `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True<<<answer>>>"
