    "To solve the expression `True and not False and not not True`, we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:**  \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not not True`:**  \n   - `not True` is `False`, so `not not True` is `True`.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**  \n   - Now the expression becomes `True and True and True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the `and` operations:**  \n   - `True and True` is `True`.\n   - `True and True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True<<<answer>>>"
