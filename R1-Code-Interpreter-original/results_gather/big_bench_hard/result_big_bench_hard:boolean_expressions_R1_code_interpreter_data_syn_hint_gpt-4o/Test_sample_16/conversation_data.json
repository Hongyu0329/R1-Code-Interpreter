    "To solve the expression `not not False and not not not False`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the precedence and associativity of the logical operators.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not not False`:**\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not not not False`:**\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n3. **Combine the results with `and`:**\n   - We have `False and True`.\n\n4. **Evaluate `False and True`:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`.\n   - Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False<<<answer>>>"
