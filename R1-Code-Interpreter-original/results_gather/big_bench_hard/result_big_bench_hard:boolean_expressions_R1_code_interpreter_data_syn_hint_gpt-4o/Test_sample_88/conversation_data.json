    "To solve the logical expression `True and True and True or not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. Substitute the result back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `True and True and True or True`.\n\n3. Evaluate the `and` operations from left to right:\n   - `True and True` is `True`.\n   - `True and True` (again) is `True`.\n\n4. Now the expression is `True or True`.\n\n5. Evaluate the `or` operation:\n   - `True or True` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True<<<answer>>>"
