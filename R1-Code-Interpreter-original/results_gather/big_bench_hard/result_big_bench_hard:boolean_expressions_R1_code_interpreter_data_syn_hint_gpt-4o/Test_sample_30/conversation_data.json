    "To solve the expression `False and (not False) or False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. Here, we have `(not False)`. The `not` operator negates the boolean value, so `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **AND**: Now, substitute the result from the parentheses back into the expression. We have `False and True or False`. The `and` operator evaluates to `True` only if both operands are `True`. In this case, `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. **OR**: Finally, we evaluate the `or` operation. The expression is now `False or False`. The `or` operator evaluates to `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `False and (not False) or False` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False"
