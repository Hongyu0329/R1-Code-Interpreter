    "To solve the expression `not ( False ) and ( False )`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step.\n\n1. **Evaluate the `not` operation**: \n   - `not (False)` evaluates to `True` because the `not` operator inverts the boolean value.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `and` operation**:\n   - Now we have `True and False`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `True and False` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not ( False ) and ( False )` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False<<<answer>>>"
