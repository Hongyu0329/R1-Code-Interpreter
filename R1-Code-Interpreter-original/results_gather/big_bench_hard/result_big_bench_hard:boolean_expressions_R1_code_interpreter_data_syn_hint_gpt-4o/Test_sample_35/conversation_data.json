    "To solve the expression `not True or not False and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not True`: This becomes `False`.\n2. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n3. Evaluate `not False` again: This also becomes `True`.\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression:\n\n- The expression becomes `False or True and True`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the `and` operation:\n\n4. `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n- `False or True`\n\nFinally, evaluate the `or` operation:\n\n5. `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not True or not False and not False` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
