    "To solve the expression `not not False or False and not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not not False`:\n   - `not False` is `True`\n   - `not True` is `False`\n\n2. Evaluate `not True`:\n   - `not True` is `False`\n\n3. Now substitute these results back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `False or False and False`\n\n4. Evaluate `False and False`:\n   - `False and False` is `False`\n\n5. Finally, evaluate `False or False`:\n   - `False or False` is `False`\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False"
