    "To solve the expression `not True or (False and True)`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate the `and` operation**: \n   - The expression inside the parentheses is `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operation returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `False and True` is `False`.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `not` operation**:\n   - The expression now becomes `not True or False`.\n   - The `not` operation negates the truth value of the operand. So, `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the `or` operation**:\n   - The expression is now `False or False`.\n   - The `or` operation returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result of `False or False` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not True or (False and True)` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False"
