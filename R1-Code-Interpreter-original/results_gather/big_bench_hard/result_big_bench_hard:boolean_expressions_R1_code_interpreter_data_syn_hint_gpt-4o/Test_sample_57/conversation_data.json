    "To solve the expression `False or not (False) or True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The expression inside the parentheses is `False`. So, it remains `False`.\n\n2. **NOT**: The `not` operator negates the value of the expression it precedes. So, `not (False)` becomes `True`.\n\n3. **OR**: Now, we evaluate the `or` operations from left to right:\n   - The first part is `False or True`. Since `or` returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`, this part evaluates to `True`.\n   - The next part is `True or True`. Again, since at least one operand is `True`, this evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
