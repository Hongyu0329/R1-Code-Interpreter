    "To solve the expression `(False) and not False and True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: There are no nested parentheses to evaluate first, so we can proceed with the operations as they appear.\n\n2. **Logical NOT**: The `not` operator has higher precedence than `and`, so we evaluate `not False` first. `not False` is `True`.\n\n3. **Logical AND**: Now we evaluate the `and` operations from left to right:\n   - The expression becomes `False and True and True`.\n   - Evaluate `False and True`: This results in `False` because the `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`.\n   - Now the expression is `False and True`.\n   - Evaluate `False and True`: This again results in `False`.\n\nThe final result of the expression is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> False"
