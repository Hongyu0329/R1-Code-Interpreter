    "To solve the expression `(False) or not False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: There are no operations inside parentheses to evaluate first, so we move on.\n2. **Not**: The `not` operator has the highest precedence, so we evaluate `not False` first. `not False` is `True`.\n3. **Or**: The `or` operator is evaluated from left to right. The expression now becomes `False or True or True`.\n\n   - Evaluate `False or True`: This results in `True` because `or` returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.\n   - Now, the expression is `True or True`.\n\n4. **Final Or**: Evaluate `True or True`, which is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<'True'>>>"
