    "To solve the expression `False or not (True) and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first. In this case, it's just `True`, so it remains `True`.\n\n2. **NOT**: Apply the NOT operator to the result of the parentheses. `not (True)` becomes `False`.\n\n3. **AND**: Evaluate the AND operation next. We have `False and False`, which results in `False`.\n\n4. **OR**: Finally, evaluate the OR operation. We have `False or False`, which results in `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `False or not (True) and False` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False<<<answer>>>"
