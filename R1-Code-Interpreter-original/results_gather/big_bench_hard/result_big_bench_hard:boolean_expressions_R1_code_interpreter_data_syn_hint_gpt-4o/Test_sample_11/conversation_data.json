    "To solve the expression `not False or True and False and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators in Python, which is similar to mathematical operations. The order of precedence is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True` because `not` inverts the boolean value.\n2. Evaluate `True and False`: This becomes `False` because both operands need to be `True` for `and` to return `True`.\n3. Evaluate `False and False`: This remains `False` because both operands are `False`.\n4. Finally, evaluate `True or False`: This becomes `True` because at least one operand is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<'True'>>>"
