    "To solve the expression `(True) and True and not True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: There are no parentheses that change the order of operations, so we can evaluate from left to right.\n2. **Logical AND (`and`)**: The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n3. **Logical NOT (`not`)**: The `not` operator negates the boolean value. `not True` becomes `False`.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The expression is `(True) and True and not True`.\n- Evaluate `not True` first, which results in `False`.\n- Now the expression becomes `True and True and False`.\n- Evaluate `True and True`, which results in `True`.\n- Now the expression is `True and False`.\n- Finally, evaluate `True and False`, which results in `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False<<<answer>>>"
