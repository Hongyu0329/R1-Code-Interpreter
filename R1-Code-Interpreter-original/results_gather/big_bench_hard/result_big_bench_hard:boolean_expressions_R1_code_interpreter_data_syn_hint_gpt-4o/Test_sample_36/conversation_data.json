    "To solve the expression `False or True or False and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Evaluate `False and True`: Since `and` requires both operands to be `True` for the result to be `True`, this becomes `False`.\n3. Evaluate `False or True`: Since `or` requires at least one operand to be `True` for the result to be `True`, this becomes `True`.\n4. Finally, evaluate `True or False`: This remains `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to evaluate the expression:\n\n```python\nresult = False or True or False and not False\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the expression `False or True or False and not False` evaluates to `True`. The logical operations were performed in the correct order of precedence, and the final result is consistent with our step-by-step reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<'True'>>>"
