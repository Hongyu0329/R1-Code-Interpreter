    "To solve the expression `True and not False or False and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Substitute back into the expression: `True and True or False and False`.\n3. Evaluate `True and True`: This becomes `True`.\n4. Substitute back into the expression: `True or False and False`.\n5. Evaluate `False and False`: This becomes `False`.\n6. Substitute back into the expression: `True or False`.\n7. Evaluate `True or False`: This becomes `True`.\n\nThe final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True<<<answer>>>"
