    "To solve the expression `False or ( not False ) and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have `not False`. The `not` operator negates the value, so `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **AND**: Next, we evaluate the `and` operation.\n   - The expression now is `False or True and True`.\n   - According to the order of operations, `and` is evaluated before `or`.\n   - `True and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **OR**: Finally, we evaluate the `or` operation.\n   - The expression is now `False or True`.\n   - `False or True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
