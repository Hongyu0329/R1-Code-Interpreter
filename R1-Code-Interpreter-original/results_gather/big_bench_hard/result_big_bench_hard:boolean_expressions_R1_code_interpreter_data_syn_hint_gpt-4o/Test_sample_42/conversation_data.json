    "To solve the expression `not not True and not False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the precedence of logical operators in Python. The precedence order is `not`, `and`, then `or`.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not not True`:**\n   - `not True` is `False`.\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n   - So, `not not True` is `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `not False`:**\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n3. **Combine with `and`:**\n   - We have `True and True` from the previous evaluations.\n   - `True and True` is `True`.\n\n4. **Combine with `or True`:**\n   - We have `True or True`.\n   - `True or True` is `True`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
