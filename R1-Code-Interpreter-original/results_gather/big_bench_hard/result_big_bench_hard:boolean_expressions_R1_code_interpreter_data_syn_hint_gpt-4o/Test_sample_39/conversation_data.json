    "To solve the expression `(False) or False and not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not True`: \n   - `not True` is `False`.\n\n2. Evaluate `False and not True`:\n   - This becomes `False and False`, which is `False` because both operands are `False`.\n\n3. Evaluate `(False) or (result from step 2)`:\n   - This becomes `False or False`, which is `False` because both operands are `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `(False) or False and not True` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False"
