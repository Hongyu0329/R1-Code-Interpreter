    "To solve the expression `False and not (False or False)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `False or False`.\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. Since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n2. Apply the `not` operator to the result of step 1: `not (False)`.\n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. Evaluate the entire expression: `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since the first operand is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `False and not (False or False)` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False"
