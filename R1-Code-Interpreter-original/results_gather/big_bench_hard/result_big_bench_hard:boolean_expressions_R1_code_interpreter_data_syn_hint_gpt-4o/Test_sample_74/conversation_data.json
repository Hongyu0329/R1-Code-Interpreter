    "To solve the expression `(not False or True) and True`, we need to evaluate it step by step using logical operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not False`:** \n   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value. \n   - `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate `True or True`:**\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since both operands are `True`, the result is `True`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `True and True`:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`.\n   - Since both operands are `True`, the result is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression `(not False or True) and True` evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
