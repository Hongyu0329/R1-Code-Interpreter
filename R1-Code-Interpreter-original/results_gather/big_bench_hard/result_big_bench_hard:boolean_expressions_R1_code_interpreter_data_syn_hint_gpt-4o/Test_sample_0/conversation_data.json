    "To solve the expression `not (True) and (True)`, we need to evaluate the logical operations step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the `not` operation**: \n   - `not (True)` evaluates to `False` because the `not` operator inverts the boolean value.\n\n2. **Evaluate the `and` operation**:\n   - Now we have `False and True`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result of `False and True` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression `not (True) and (True)` is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False"
