    "To solve the expression `not not not (True and False)`, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `True and False`.\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, the result is `False`.\n\n2. Apply the first `not` to the result of the parentheses: `not False`.\n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. So, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\n3. Apply the second `not` to the result: `not True`.\n   - Again, the `not` operator inverts the boolean value. So, `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n4. Apply the third `not` to the result: `not False`.\n   - Finally, `not False` becomes `True`.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression `not not not (True and False)` is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
