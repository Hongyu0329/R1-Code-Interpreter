    "To solve the expression `not False or True and not not True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: \n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n2. Evaluate `not not True`: \n   - `not True` is `False`.\n   - `not False` is `True`.\n\n3. Now substitute these results back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes `True or True and True`.\n\n4. Evaluate `True and True`:\n   - `True and True` is `True`.\n\n5. Finally, evaluate `True or True`:\n   - `True or True` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True<<<answer>>>"
