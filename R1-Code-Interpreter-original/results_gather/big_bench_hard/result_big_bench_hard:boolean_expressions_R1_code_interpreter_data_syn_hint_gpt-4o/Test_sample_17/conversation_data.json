    "To solve the expression `(True and not True and False)`, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the rules of logical operations in Python.\n\n1. **Evaluate `not True`:** \n   - The `not` operator inverts the boolean value. So, `not True` becomes `False`.\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `(True and False and False)`.\n\n3. **Evaluate `True and False`:**\n   - The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`. Since one of the operands is `False`, `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes `(False and False)`.\n\n5. **Evaluate `False and False`:**\n   - Again, using the `and` operator, since both operands are `False`, the result is `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `(True and not True and False)` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False"
