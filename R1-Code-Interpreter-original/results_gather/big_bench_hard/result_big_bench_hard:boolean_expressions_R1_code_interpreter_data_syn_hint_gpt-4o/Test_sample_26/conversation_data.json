    "To solve the expression `False and False or True and not False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. The expression now is `False and False or True and True`.\n3. Evaluate `False and False`: This becomes `False`.\n4. The expression now is `False or True and True`.\n5. Evaluate `True and True`: This becomes `True`.\n6. The expression now is `False or True`.\n7. Evaluate `False or True`: This becomes `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True<<<answer>>>"
