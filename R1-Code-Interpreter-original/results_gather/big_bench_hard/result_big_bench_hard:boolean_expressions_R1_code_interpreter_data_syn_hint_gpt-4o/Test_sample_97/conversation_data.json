    "To solve the expression `not True or False and True and True`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical operators, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order of precedence for logical operators is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not True`: This becomes `False`.\n2. The expression now is `False or False and True and True`.\n3. Evaluate `False and True`: This becomes `False`.\n4. The expression now is `False or False and True`.\n5. Evaluate `False and True`: This becomes `False`.\n6. The expression now is `False or False`.\n7. Evaluate `False or False`: This becomes `False`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `False`.\n\n<<<answer>>>False<<<answer>>>"
