    "To solve the expression `not False and not False and not False`, we need to evaluate each part of the expression step by step:\n\n1. `not False` evaluates to `True` because the `not` operator inverts the boolean value.\n2. The expression then becomes `True and True and True`.\n3. The `and` operator returns `True` if all operands are `True`. Since all parts of the expression are `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<'True'>>>"
