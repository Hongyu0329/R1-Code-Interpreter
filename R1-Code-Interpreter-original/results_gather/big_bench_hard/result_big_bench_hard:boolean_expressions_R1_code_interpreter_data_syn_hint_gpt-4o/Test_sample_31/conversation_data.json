    "To solve the expression `not not not not ( not False )`, we need to understand how the `not` operator works in Python. The `not` operator is a logical negation operator that inverts the truth value of the operand.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: `not False`. \n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. Apply the next `not` to the result: `not True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n3. Apply the next `not` to the result: `not False`.\n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n4. Apply the final `not` to the result: `not True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\nThus, the entire expression `not not not not ( not False )` evaluates to `False`.\n\n<<<'False'>>>"
