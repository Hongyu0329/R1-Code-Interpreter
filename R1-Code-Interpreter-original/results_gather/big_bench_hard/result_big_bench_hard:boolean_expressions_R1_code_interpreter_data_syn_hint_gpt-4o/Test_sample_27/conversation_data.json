    "To solve the expression `not not False or not False or True`, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the precedence of logical operators in Python.\n\n1. **not not False**: \n   - `not False` evaluates to `True`.\n   - `not True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **not False**: \n   - This evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **True**: \n   - This is already `True`.\n\nNow, the expression becomes `False or True or True`.\n\n4. **or** operator:\n   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.\n   - Since the second operand is `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is `True`.\n\n<<<answer>>>True"
