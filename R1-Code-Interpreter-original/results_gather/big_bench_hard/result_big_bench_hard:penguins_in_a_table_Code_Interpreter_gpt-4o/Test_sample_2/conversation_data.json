    "\nassistant > To determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old, we need to examine the age of each penguin in the table. Let's analyze the data:\n\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Bernard: 5 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n\nNow, let's count the number of penguins whose age is greater than 5. \n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Bernard is 5 years old, which is not more than 5.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is more than 5.\n\nThus, there are 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
