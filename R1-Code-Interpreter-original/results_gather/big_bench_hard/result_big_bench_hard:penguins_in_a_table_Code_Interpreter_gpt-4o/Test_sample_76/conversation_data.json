    "\nassistant > To determine how many penguins are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg, we can analyze the given data:\n\n1. Louis: age = 7, weight = 11 kg\n2. Bernard: age = 5, weight = 13 kg\n3. Vincent: age = 9, weight = 11 kg\n4. Gwen: age = 8, weight = 15 kg\n\nNow, let's check each penguin against the criteria (age < 8 and weight < 12 kg):\n\n- Louis: age = 7 (less than 8), weight = 11 kg (less than 12 kg) → Meets criteria\n- Bernard: age = 5 (less than 8), weight = 13 kg (not less than 12 kg) → Does not meet criteria\n- Vincent: age = 9 (not less than 8), weight = 11 kg (less than 12 kg) → Does not meet criteria\n- Gwen: age = 8 (not less than 8), weight = 15 kg (not less than 12 kg) → Does not meet criteria\n\nOnly Louis meets both criteria. Therefore, the number of penguins that meet the criteria is 1.\n\nThe answer is (A) 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
