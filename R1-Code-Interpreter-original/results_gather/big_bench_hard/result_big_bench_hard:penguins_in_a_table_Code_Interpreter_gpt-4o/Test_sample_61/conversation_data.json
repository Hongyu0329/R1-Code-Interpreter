    "\nassistant > To find the cumulated age of the penguins, we need to sum the ages of all the penguins listed in the table. Let's calculate it:\n\n- Louis: 7 years\n- Bernard: 5 years\n- Vincent: 9 years\n- Gwen: 8 years\n\nThe cumulated age is the sum of these ages. Let's calculate it.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Ages of the penguins\nages = [7, 5, 9, 8]\n\n# Calculate the cumulated age\ncumulated_age = sum(ages)\ncumulated_age\nassistant > The cumulated age of the penguins is 29. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
