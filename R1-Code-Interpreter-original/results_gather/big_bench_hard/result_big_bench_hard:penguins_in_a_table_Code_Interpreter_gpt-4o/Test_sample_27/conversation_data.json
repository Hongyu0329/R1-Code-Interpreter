    "\nassistant > Let's first represent the table of penguins and then remove Bernard from it. After that, we can count how many penguins are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.\n\nThe initial table is:\n\n| Name    | Age | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) |\n|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|\n| Louis   | 7   | 50          | 11          |\n| Bernard | 5   | 80          | 13          |\n| Vincent | 9   | 60          | 11          |\n| Gwen    | 8   | 70          | 15          |\n\nAfter removing Bernard, the table becomes:\n\n| Name    | Age | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) |\n|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|\n| Louis   | 7   | 50          | 11          |\n| Vincent | 9   | 60          | 11          |\n| Gwen    | 8   | 70          | 15          |\n\nNow, let's count the penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the penguins data after removing Bernard\npenguins = [\n    {\"name\": \"Louis\", \"age\": 7, \"height\": 50, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Vincent\", \"age\": 9, \"height\": 60, \"weight\": 11},\n    {\"name\": \"Gwen\", \"age\": 8, \"height\": 70, \"weight\": 15}\n]\n\n# Count penguins more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg\ncount = sum(1 for penguin in penguins if penguin[\"age\"] > 5 and penguin[\"weight\"] > 12)\ncount\nassistant > There is only one penguin who is more than 5 years old and weighs more than 12 kg.
