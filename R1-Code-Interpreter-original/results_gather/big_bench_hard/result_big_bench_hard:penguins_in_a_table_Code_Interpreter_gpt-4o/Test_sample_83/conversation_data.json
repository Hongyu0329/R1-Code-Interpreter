    "\nassistant > Let's first organize the data into a table format and then remove Bernard from the list. After that, we can count the number of penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.\n\nInitial table:\n```\n| Name    | Age | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) |\n|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|\n| Louis   | 7   | 50          | 11          |\n| Bernard | 5   | 80          | 13          |\n| Vincent | 9   | 60          | 11          |\n| Gwen    | 8   | 70          | 15          |\n```\n\nAfter removing Bernard:\n```\n| Name    | Age | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) |\n|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|\n| Louis   | 7   | 50          | 11          |\n| Vincent | 9   | 60          | 11          |\n| Gwen    | 8   | 70          | 15          |\n```\n\nNow, let's count the penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh less than 12 kg. \n\n- Louis: Age = 7, Weight = 11 (satisfies both conditions)\n- Vincent: Age = 9, Weight = 11 (satisfies both conditions)\n- Gwen: Age = 8, Weight = 15 (does not satisfy the weight condition)\n\nThus, there are 2 penguins who satisfy the conditions. The answer is (B) 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
