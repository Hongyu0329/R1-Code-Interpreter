    "\nassistant > To determine the second heaviest penguin, we need to first extract the weights of each penguin and then sort them to find the second heaviest. Let's list the weights:\n\n- Louis: 11 kg\n- Bernard: 13 kg\n- Vincent: 11 kg\n- Gwen: 15 kg\n\nNow, let's sort these weights in descending order to find the second heaviest. \n\nThe sorted weights are: 15 kg, 13 kg, 11 kg, 11 kg.\n\nThe second heaviest weight is 13 kg, which belongs to Bernard.\n\nTherefore, the second heaviest penguin is Bernard.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Bernard>>>"
