    "\nassistant > To find the average height of the penguins, we first need to sum the heights of all the penguins and then divide by the number of penguins.\n\nThe heights of the penguins are as follows:\n- Louis: 50 cm\n- Bernard: 80 cm\n- Vincent: 60 cm\n- Gwen: 70 cm\n- James: 90 cm\n\nLet's calculate the average height.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Heights of the penguins\nheights = [50, 80, 60, 70, 90]\n\n# Calculate the average height\naverage_height = sum(heights) / len(heights)\naverage_height\nassistant > The average height of the penguins is 70 cm. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
