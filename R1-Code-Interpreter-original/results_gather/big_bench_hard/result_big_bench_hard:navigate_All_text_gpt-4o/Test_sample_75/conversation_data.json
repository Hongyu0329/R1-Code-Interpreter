    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at position 0.\n\n2. **Take 9 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward means you are moving in the negative direction.\n   - Position = 0 - 9 = -9\n\n3. **Take 2 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward means you are moving in the positive direction.\n   - Position = -9 + 2 = -7\n\n4. **Take 1 step backward**: \n   - Moving backward again means moving in the negative direction.\n   - Position = -7 - 1 = -8\n\n5. **Take 8 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward means moving in the positive direction.\n   - Position = -8 + 8 = 0\n\nAfter performing all the steps, you end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
