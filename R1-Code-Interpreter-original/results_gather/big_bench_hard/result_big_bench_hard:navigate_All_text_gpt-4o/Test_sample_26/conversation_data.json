    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 10 steps**: You move 10 steps forward from the starting point.\n\n2. **Turn around**: You change direction to face the opposite way.\n\n3. **Take 4 steps**: You move 4 steps in the opposite direction from where you were initially heading. This means you are now 6 steps away from the starting point (10 steps forward - 4 steps back = 6 steps forward).\n\n4. **Take 6 steps**: You continue moving in the same direction you turned to, which is still the opposite direction from the initial forward direction. You move 6 more steps back towards the starting point. Now, you are at the starting point (6 steps forward - 6 steps back = 0 steps from the starting point).\n\n5. **Turn around**: You change direction again, but this does not affect your position relative to the starting point.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you are back at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
