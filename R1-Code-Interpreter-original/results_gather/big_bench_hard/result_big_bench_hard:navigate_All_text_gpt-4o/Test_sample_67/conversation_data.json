    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you are facing forward at the starting point.\n\n2. **Take 1 step right**: \n   - You move 1 step to the right of your current position.\n\n3. **Take 4 steps right**: \n   - You continue moving in the same direction (right) and take 4 more steps. \n   - Total steps to the right = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\n4. **Take 5 steps left**: \n   - You now move in the opposite direction (left) and take 5 steps.\n   - Since you were 5 steps to the right, moving 5 steps left brings you back to the starting point.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
