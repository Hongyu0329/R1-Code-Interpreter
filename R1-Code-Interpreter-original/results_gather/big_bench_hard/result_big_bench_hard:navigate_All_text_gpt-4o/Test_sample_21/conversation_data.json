    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 4 steps**: \n   - You start at the origin (0,0) and take 4 steps in a straight line. Let's assume you are moving in the positive direction (e.g., north or east). After 4 steps, you are at position 4.\n\n2. **Take 2 steps**: \n   - Continuing in the same direction, you take 2 more steps. Now you are at position 6.\n\n3. **Turn around**: \n   - Turning around means you will now face the opposite direction. If you were moving in the positive direction, you are now facing the negative direction.\n\n4. **Take 6 steps**: \n   - Moving in the opposite direction, you take 6 steps back. Starting from position 6 and moving 6 steps in the negative direction brings you back to position 0.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
