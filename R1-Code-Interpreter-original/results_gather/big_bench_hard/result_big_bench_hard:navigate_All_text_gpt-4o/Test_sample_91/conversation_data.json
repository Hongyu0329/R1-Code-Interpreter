    "To determine if following the given instructions will return you to the starting point, let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position and Orientation**: \n   - Assume you start at a point (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Instruction Analysis**:\n   - **Turn left**: \n     - If you are facing north, turning left will make you face west.\n   \n   - **Take 9 steps**: \n     - Facing west, taking 9 steps will move you 9 units to the left on the x-axis. \n     - New position: (-9, 0).\n   \n   - **Take 9 steps**: \n     - Still facing west, taking another 9 steps will move you another 9 units to the left on the x-axis.\n     - New position: (-18, 0).\n\n3. **Final Position**:\n   - After executing all the instructions, you end up at position (-18, 0).\n\n4. **Comparison with Starting Point**:\n   - The starting point was (0, 0).\n   - The final position is (-18, 0), which is not the same as the starting point.\n\nTherefore, following the instructions does not return you to the starting point.\n\n<<<No>>>"
