    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Take 7 steps**: \n   - Since you are facing north, taking 7 steps will move you 7 units up on the y-axis.\n   - New position: (0, 7).\n\n3. **Turn right**: \n   - Turning right from north means you are now facing east.\n\n4. **Turn right**: \n   - Turning right from east means you are now facing south.\n\n5. **Take 6 steps**: \n   - Since you are facing south, taking 6 steps will move you 6 units down on the y-axis.\n   - New position: (0, 7 - 6) = (0, 1).\n\n6. **Turn right**: \n   - Turning right from south means you are now facing west.\n\nNow, let's evaluate if you have returned to the starting point:\n\n- Starting point: (0, 0)\n- Current position: (0, 1)\n\nSince the current position (0, 1) is not the same as the starting point (0, 0), you have not returned to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
