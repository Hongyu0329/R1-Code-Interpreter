    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the movements step by step and see if the net displacement is zero.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at the origin (0, 0) on a coordinate plane.\n\n2. **Take 9 steps forward**: \n   - Assume \"forward\" is in the positive y-direction.\n   - New position: (0, 9)\n\n3. **Take 7 steps left**: \n   - Assume \"left\" is in the negative x-direction.\n   - New position: (-7, 9)\n\n4. **Take 5 steps backward**: \n   - Assume \"backward\" is in the negative y-direction.\n   - New position: (-7, 4)\n\n5. **Take 4 steps right**: \n   - Assume \"right\" is in the positive x-direction.\n   - New position: (-3, 4)\n\n6. **Take 3 steps right**: \n   - Continue in the positive x-direction.\n   - New position: (0, 4)\n\n7. **Take 4 steps backward**: \n   - Continue in the negative y-direction.\n   - New position: (0, 0)\n\nAfter analyzing each step, the final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
