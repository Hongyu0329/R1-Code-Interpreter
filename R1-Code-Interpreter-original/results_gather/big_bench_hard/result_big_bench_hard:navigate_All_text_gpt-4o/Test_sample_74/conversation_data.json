    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the instructions step by step, keeping track of the direction and position.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at the origin (0, 0) facing forward (north).\n\n2. **Take 9 steps left**: \n   - Facing north, left is west.\n   - Move 9 steps west: Position = (-9, 0).\n\n3. **Take 7 steps forward**: \n   - Still facing north.\n   - Move 7 steps north: Position = (-9, 7).\n\n4. **Take 9 steps right**: \n   - Facing north, right is east.\n   - Move 9 steps east: Position = (0, 7).\n\n5. **Take 7 steps left**: \n   - Facing north, left is west.\n   - Move 7 steps west: Position = (-7, 7).\n\n6. **Take 7 steps backward**: \n   - Facing north, backward is south.\n   - Move 7 steps south: Position = (-7, 0).\n\n7. **Take 8 steps right**: \n   - Facing north, right is east.\n   - Move 8 steps east: Position = (1, 0).\n\n8. **Take 10 steps left**: \n   - Facing north, left is west.\n   - Move 10 steps west: Position = (-9, 0).\n\n9. **Take 1 step backward**: \n   - Facing north, backward is south.\n   - Move 1 step south: Position = (-9, -1).\n\n10. **Take 1 step forward**: \n    - Facing north.\n    - Move 1 step north: Position = (-9, 0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, the final position is (-9, 0), which is not the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
