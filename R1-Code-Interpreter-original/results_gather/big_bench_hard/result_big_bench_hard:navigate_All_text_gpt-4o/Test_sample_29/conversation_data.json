    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: You begin at a starting point, which we can consider as position 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **Always face forward**: This means you are consistently moving in one direction, which we will consider as the positive direction on the number line.\n\n3. **Take 5 steps forward**: \n   - From position 0, you move 5 steps forward.\n   - New position = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\n4. **Take 7 steps backward**: \n   - From position 5, you move 7 steps backward.\n   - New position = 5 - 7 = -2.\n\n5. **Take 10 steps backward**: \n   - From position -2, you move 10 steps backward.\n   - New position = -2 - 10 = -12.\n\nNow, let's determine if you return to the starting point:\n\n- The starting point was position 0.\n- After following all the instructions, you end up at position -12.\n\nSince -12 is not equal to 0, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
