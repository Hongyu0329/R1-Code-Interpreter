    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 8 steps**: You start at the origin (0,0) and move 8 steps in a straight line. Let's assume you are moving north, so you end up at (0,8).\n\n2. **Take 1 step**: You continue moving in the same direction (north) for 1 more step. Now you are at (0,9).\n\n3. **Take 8 steps**: You continue moving in the same direction (north) for 8 more steps. Now you are at (0,17).\n\n4. **Turn right**: Turning right from north means you are now facing east. However, you do not take any additional steps in this direction.\n\nNow, let's evaluate if you have returned to the starting point:\n\n- The starting point was (0,0).\n- The final position is (0,17).\n\nSince the final position is not the same as the starting point, you have not returned to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
