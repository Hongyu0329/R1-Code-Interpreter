    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point facing a certain direction (let's say North for simplicity).\n\n2. **Take 8 steps**: Move 8 steps forward in the direction you are facing (North).\n\n3. **Take 1 step**: Move 1 more step forward in the same direction (North). You have now moved a total of 9 steps North.\n\n4. **Turn left**: Turning left from North means you are now facing West.\n\n5. **Turn left**: Turning left again from West means you are now facing South.\n\n6. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 steps forward in the direction you are facing (South).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the net movement:\n\n- You initially moved 9 steps North.\n- After turning, you moved 9 steps South.\n\nSince moving 9 steps North and then 9 steps South cancels each other out, you end up at the same vertical position as the starting point. There were no horizontal movements (East or West), so your horizontal position remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, you return to the starting point.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yes>>>."
