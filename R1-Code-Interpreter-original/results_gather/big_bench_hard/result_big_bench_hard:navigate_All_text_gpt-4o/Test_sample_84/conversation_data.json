    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the movements step by step and consider both the forward/backward and right/left directions separately.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin point (0, 0).\n\n2. **Always face forward**: This implies that the forward and backward movements are along the same line, which we can consider as the y-axis.\n\n3. **Take 1 step backward**: \n   - Move 1 step in the negative y-direction.\n   - New position: (0, -1).\n\n4. **Take 5 steps forward**: \n   - Move 5 steps in the positive y-direction.\n   - New position: (0, 4).\n\n5. **Take 10 steps backward**: \n   - Move 10 steps in the negative y-direction.\n   - New position: (0, -6).\n\n6. **Take 9 steps forward**: \n   - Move 9 steps in the positive y-direction.\n   - New position: (0, 3).\n\n7. **Take 7 steps right**: \n   - Move 7 steps in the positive x-direction.\n   - New position: (7, 3).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the final position:\n\n- The final position is (7, 3).\n- The starting position was (0, 0).\n\nSince the final position (7, 3) is not the same as the starting position (0, 0), you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
