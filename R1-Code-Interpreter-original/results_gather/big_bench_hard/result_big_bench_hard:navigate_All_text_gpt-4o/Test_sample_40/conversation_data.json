    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the sequence of movements and determine if they result in returning to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start facing forward at a point labeled as the origin (0).\n\n2. **Take 8 steps left**: \n   - Moving left from the starting point means moving in the negative direction.\n   - Position: 0 - 8 = -8\n\n3. **Take 6 steps right**: \n   - Moving right means moving in the positive direction.\n   - Position: -8 + 6 = -2\n\n4. **Take 10 steps right**: \n   - Continue moving in the positive direction.\n   - Position: -2 + 10 = 8\n\n5. **Take 2 steps left**: \n   - Moving left means moving in the negative direction.\n   - Position: 8 - 2 = 6\n\n6. **Take 5 steps left**: \n   - Continue moving in the negative direction.\n   - Position: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n7. **Take 1 step left**: \n   - Continue moving in the negative direction.\n   - Position: 1 - 1 = 0\n\nAfter following all the instructions, the final position is 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
