    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position and Direction**: \n   - Assume you start at a point (0, 0) facing north.\n\n2. **Take 3 steps**: \n   - Moving north, you take 3 steps. \n   - New position: (0, 3).\n\n3. **Turn around**: \n   - Turning around from north means you now face south.\n\n4. **Take 3 steps**: \n   - Moving south, you take 3 steps. \n   - New position: (0, 0).\n\n5. **Turn right**: \n   - Facing south, turning right means you now face west.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at the starting point (0, 0), but facing a different direction (west).\n\nThe question asks if you return to the starting point, not if you face the same direction. Since you are indeed back at the starting point, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
