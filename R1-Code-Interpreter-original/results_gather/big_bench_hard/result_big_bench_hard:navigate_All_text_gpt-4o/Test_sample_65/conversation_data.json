    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at position 0.\n\n2. **Take 7 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward from position 0, you take 7 steps forward.\n   - New position = 0 + 7 = 7.\n\n3. **Take 3 steps backward**: \n   - From position 7, you take 3 steps backward.\n   - New position = 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n4. **Take 4 steps backward**: \n   - From position 4, you take 4 steps backward.\n   - New position = 4 - 4 = 0.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>."
