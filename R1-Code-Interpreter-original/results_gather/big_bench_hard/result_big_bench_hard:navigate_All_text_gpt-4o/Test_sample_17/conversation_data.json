    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 3 steps.**\n   - You start at the origin (0,0) and take 3 steps in a straight line. Let's assume you are moving north. Your position is now (0,3).\n\n2. **Turn around.**\n   - Turning around means you are now facing south.\n\n3. **Take 5 steps.**\n   - Moving south from (0,3), you take 5 steps. Your new position is (0,3-5) = (0,-2).\n\n4. **Turn right.**\n   - Facing south, turning right means you are now facing west.\n\n5. **Turn right.**\n   - Facing west, turning right again means you are now facing north.\n\n6. **Take 1 step.**\n   - Moving north from (0,-2), you take 1 step. Your new position is (0,-2+1) = (0,-1).\n\n7. **Take 1 step.**\n   - Continuing north, you take another step. Your new position is (0,-1+1) = (0,0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at the starting point (0,0).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
