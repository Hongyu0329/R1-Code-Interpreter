    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point (0, 0) facing forward. For simplicity, let's assume \"forward\" means moving in the positive y-direction.\n\n2. **Take 4 steps forward**: \n   - Since you are facing forward (positive y-direction), you move 4 steps in the positive y-direction.\n   - New position: (0, 4).\n\n3. **Take 5 steps right**: \n   - Turning right from facing forward (positive y-direction) means you now face the positive x-direction.\n   - Move 5 steps in the positive x-direction.\n   - New position: (5, 4).\n\n4. **Take 7 steps left**: \n   - Turning left from facing the positive x-direction means you now face the positive y-direction again.\n   - Move 7 steps in the positive y-direction.\n   - New position: (5, 11).\n\nNow, compare the final position (5, 11) with the starting point (0, 0). Since the final position is different from the starting point, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
