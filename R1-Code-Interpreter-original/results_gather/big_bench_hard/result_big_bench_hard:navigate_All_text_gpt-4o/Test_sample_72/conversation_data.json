    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 5 steps**: You move 5 steps forward from the starting point.\n2. **Take 5 steps**: You move another 5 steps forward. Now, you are 10 steps away from the starting point.\n3. **Take 2 steps**: You move 2 more steps forward. Now, you are 12 steps away from the starting point.\n4. **Turn around**: You turn 180 degrees, facing the opposite direction.\n5. **Take 8 steps**: You move 8 steps in the opposite direction. Now, you are 4 steps away from the starting point (12 - 8 = 4).\n6. **Take 4 steps**: You move 4 more steps in the opposite direction. Now, you are back at the starting point (4 - 4 = 0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
