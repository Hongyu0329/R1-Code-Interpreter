    "To determine if you return to the starting point after taking the specified steps, let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Assume you start at a point, which we can call the origin or starting point.\n\n2. **First Movement**: Take 3 steps.\n   - After taking 3 steps, you are now 3 steps away from the starting point.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Take 6 steps.\n   - After taking 6 more steps, you are now 3 + 6 = 9 steps away from the starting point.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Take 9 steps.\n   - After taking 9 more steps, you are now 9 + 9 = 18 steps away from the starting point.\n\n5. **Final Position**: You are 18 steps away from the starting point.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Do you return to the starting point?\" \n\n- To return to the starting point, the net movement should be zero. In this case, the net movement is 18 steps away from the starting point, which means you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
