    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at position 0.\n\n2. **Take 6 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward means increasing your position.\n   - New position = 0 + 6 = 6.\n\n3. **Take 2 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward means decreasing your position.\n   - New position = 6 - 2 = 4.\n\n4. **Take 4 steps backward**: \n   - Again, moving backward decreases your position.\n   - New position = 4 - 4 = 0.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes,\" you do return to the starting point.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
