    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point labeled as 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **Take 1 step**: Move 1 step forward. Now you are at position 1.\n\n3. **Take 5 steps**: Move 5 steps forward. Now you are at position 6 (1 + 5 = 6).\n\n4. **Turn around**: This means you change direction. If you were moving forward, now you will move backward.\n\n5. **Turn around**: Change direction again. Now you are facing forward again.\n\n6. **Turn around**: Change direction once more. Now you are facing backward.\n\n7. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps backward. Since you were at position 6 and facing backward, you move to position 0 (6 - 6 = 0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
