    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the sequence of steps and directions given in the instructions. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin (0, 0) facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume you start facing north.\n\n2. **Take 1 step**: Move 1 step north. New position: (0, 1).\n\n3. **Take 5 steps**: Move 5 steps north. New position: (0, 6).\n\n4. **Take 1 step**: Move 1 step north. New position: (0, 7).\n\n5. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps north. New position: (0, 13).\n\n6. **Turn left**: Now facing west.\n\n7. **Take 7 steps**: Move 7 steps west. New position: (-7, 13).\n\n8. **Take 2 steps**: Move 2 steps west. New position: (-9, 13).\n\n9. **Take 4 steps**: Move 4 steps west. New position: (-13, 13).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, the final position is (-13, 13). The starting point was (0, 0).\n\nNow, compare the final position with the starting point:\n\n- Starting Point: (0, 0)\n- Final Position: (-13, 13)\n\nSince the final position is not the same as the starting point, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
