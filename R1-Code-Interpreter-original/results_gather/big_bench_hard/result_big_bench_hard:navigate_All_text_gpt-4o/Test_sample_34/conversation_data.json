    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 7 steps**: Assume you start at the origin (0,0) and move 7 steps in a straight line. Let's assume you move north, so your position is now (0,7).\n\n2. **Take 8 steps**: Continue moving in the same direction (north), so your position is now (0,15).\n\n3. **Turn right**: Turning right from north means you are now facing east.\n\n4. **Turn right**: Turning right again from east means you are now facing south.\n\n5. **Take 1 step**: Move 1 step south, so your position is now (0,14).\n\n6. **Take 7 steps**: Continue moving south, so your position is now (0,7).\n\n7. **Take 6 steps**: Continue moving south, so your position is now (0,1).\n\n8. **Take 1 step**: Continue moving south, so your position is now (0,0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at the starting point (0,0).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
