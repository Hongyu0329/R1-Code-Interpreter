    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the instructions and determine if following them will return us to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Always face forward**: This implies that the initial direction is forward, and we will maintain this orientation throughout the process.\n\n2. **Take 9 steps left**: \n   - If we are facing forward, taking steps to the left means we are moving perpendicular to the forward direction. \n   - Let's assume facing forward is along the positive y-axis. \n   - Taking 9 steps left would mean moving 9 steps along the negative x-axis.\n\n3. **Take 4 steps backward**: \n   - Since we are facing forward, taking steps backward means moving in the opposite direction of forward.\n   - If forward is along the positive y-axis, backward would be along the negative y-axis.\n   - Taking 4 steps backward means moving 4 steps along the negative y-axis.\n\nNow, let's summarize the movements:\n- We moved 9 steps in the negative x-direction.\n- We moved 4 steps in the negative y-direction.\n\nTo determine if we return to the starting point, we need to check if the net displacement is zero. The net displacement is calculated by summing up the movements in each direction:\n\n- In the x-direction: 0 (initial) - 9 = -9\n- In the y-direction: 0 (initial) - 4 = -4\n\nThe net displacement is (-9, -4), which is not zero. Therefore, we do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
