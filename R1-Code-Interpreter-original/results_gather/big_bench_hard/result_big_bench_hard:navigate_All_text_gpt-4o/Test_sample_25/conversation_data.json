    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the sequence of steps and turns carefully. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Assume you start at the origin (0,0) facing north.\n\n2. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 steps north. New position: (0,9).\n\n3. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps north. New position: (0,15).\n\n4. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 steps north. New position: (0,24).\n\n5. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps north. New position: (0,30).\n\n6. **Take 2 steps**: Move 2 steps north. New position: (0,32).\n\n7. **Turn left**: Now facing west.\n\n8. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps west. New position: (-6,32).\n\n9. **Turn around**: Now facing east.\n\n10. **Take 8 steps**: Move 8 steps east. New position: (2,32).\n\nNow, let's evaluate if you have returned to the starting point:\n\n- Starting point: (0,0)\n- Final position: (2,32)\n\nSince the final position (2,32) is not the same as the starting point (0,0), you have not returned to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
