    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the movements step by step and see if the net movement results in returning to the original position.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin, which we can denote as (0, 0).\n\n2. **Take 10 steps backward**: \n   - Assuming \"backward\" means moving in the negative y-direction, the new position is (0, -10).\n\n3. **Take 7 steps backward**: \n   - Continue moving in the negative y-direction, the new position is (0, -17).\n\n4. **Take 8 steps right**: \n   - Moving right means moving in the positive x-direction, the new position is (8, -17).\n\n5. **Take 6 steps right**: \n   - Continue moving in the positive x-direction, the new position is (14, -17).\n\n6. **Take 3 steps left**: \n   - Moving left means moving in the negative x-direction, the new position is (11, -17).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the final position:\n\n- The final position is (11, -17).\n- The starting position was (0, 0).\n\nSince the final position (11, -17) is not the same as the starting position (0, 0), you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
