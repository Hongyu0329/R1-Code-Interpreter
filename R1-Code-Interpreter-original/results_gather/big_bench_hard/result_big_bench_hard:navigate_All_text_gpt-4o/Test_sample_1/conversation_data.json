    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start facing forward in a specific direction, say North.\n\n2. **Take 10 steps left**: \n   - If you are facing North, turning left means you will face West.\n   - Take 10 steps in the direction you are now facing (West).\n\n3. **Take 10 steps forward**:\n   - You are currently facing West, so taking 10 steps forward means you continue moving West.\n\n4. **Take 7 steps forward**:\n   - You are still facing West, so taking 7 steps forward means you continue moving West.\n\n5. **Take 2 steps forward**:\n   - You are still facing West, so taking 2 steps forward means you continue moving West.\n\nNow, let's summarize the movement:\n- You started at the origin.\n- You moved 10 steps left (West).\n- You moved an additional 10 steps forward (West).\n- You moved an additional 7 steps forward (West).\n- You moved an additional 2 steps forward (West).\n\nTotal movement:\n- You moved 10 + 10 + 7 + 2 = 29 steps West.\n\nSince you have only moved in one direction (West) and have not returned to the starting point, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
