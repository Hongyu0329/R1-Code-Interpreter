    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the movements step by step and track the net displacement in both the forward-backward and left-right directions.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Take 8 steps forward**: \n   - Forward direction is positive, so move from (0, 0) to (0, 8).\n\n3. **Take 9 steps right**: \n   - Right direction is positive, so move from (0, 8) to (9, 8).\n\n4. **Take 2 steps forward**: \n   - Move from (9, 8) to (9, 10).\n\n5. **Take 10 steps backward**: \n   - Backward direction is negative, so move from (9, 10) to (9, 0).\n\n6. **Take 9 steps left**: \n   - Left direction is negative, so move from (9, 0) to (0, 0).\n\nAfter performing all these steps, the final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
