    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume you are facing north.\n\n2. **Take 10 steps**: \n   - If you are facing north, taking 10 steps will move you 10 units north of the starting point.\n\n3. **Turn left**: \n   - Turning left from facing north will make you face west.\n\n4. **Turn left again**: \n   - Turning left from facing west will make you face south.\n\n5. **Take 10 steps**: \n   - If you are facing south, taking 10 steps will move you 10 units south.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the net movement:\n\n- Initially, you moved 10 steps north.\n- After turning left twice, you moved 10 steps south.\n\nThe net movement in the north-south direction is:\n- 10 steps north - 10 steps south = 0 steps\n\nSince there is no movement in the east-west direction (as you only turned left and did not take any steps in that direction), the net movement in the east-west direction is 0.\n\nTherefore, you end up at the same point where you started.\n\nThe answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
