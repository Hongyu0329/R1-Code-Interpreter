    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the instructions step by step and analyze the movements to determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume you start facing north.\n\n2. **First Instruction - Turn Right**: \n   - If you are facing north, turning right means you will now face east.\n\n3. **Second Instruction - Take 9 Steps**: \n   - Since you are facing east, taking 9 steps means you move 9 units to the east.\n\n4. **Third Instruction - Turn Around**: \n   - Turning around from facing east means you will now face west.\n\n5. **Fourth Instruction - Take 9 Steps**: \n   - Since you are facing west, taking 9 steps means you move 9 units to the west. This movement will bring you back to the original east-west position since you moved 9 steps east initially.\n\n6. **Fifth Instruction - Turn Right**: \n   - If you are facing west, turning right means you will now face north.\n\nNow, let's analyze the final position:\n- You started at the origin (0,0) facing north.\n- After the first turn and 9 steps, you moved to (9,0) facing east.\n- After turning around and taking 9 steps, you returned to (0,0) facing west.\n- After the final right turn, you are facing north again.\n\nSince you are back at the original position (0,0) and facing the original direction (north), you have returned to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
