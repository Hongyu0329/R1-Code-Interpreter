    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the movements step by step and see if the net displacement is zero.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin (0, 0).\n\n2. **Take 5 steps right**: \n   - Moving right affects the horizontal position.\n   - New position: (5, 0).\n\n3. **Take 8 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward affects the vertical position.\n   - New position: (5, -8).\n\n4. **Take 1 step right**: \n   - Moving right affects the horizontal position.\n   - New position: (6, -8).\n\n5. **Take 7 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward affects the vertical position.\n   - New position: (6, -15).\n\nNow, let's analyze the final position:\n\n- The final horizontal position is 6.\n- The final vertical position is -15.\n\nThe starting point was (0, 0), and the final position is (6, -15). Since the final position is not the same as the starting point, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
