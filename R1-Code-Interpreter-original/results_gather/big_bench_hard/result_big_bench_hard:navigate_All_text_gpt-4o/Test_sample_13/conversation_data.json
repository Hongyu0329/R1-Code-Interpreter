    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the instructions step by step and track the net movement in each direction. Let's assume the starting point is at the origin (0, 0) on a coordinate plane, where forward/backward movement affects the y-coordinate and left/right movement affects the x-coordinate.\n\n1. **Always face forward.**  \n   - This sets the initial direction for forward and backward movements along the y-axis.\n\n2. **Take 5 steps backward.**  \n   - Moving backward decreases the y-coordinate by 5.  \n   - New position: (0, -5).\n\n3. **Take 2 steps left.**  \n   - Moving left decreases the x-coordinate by 2.  \n   - New position: (-2, -5).\n\n4. **Take 5 steps right.**  \n   - Moving right increases the x-coordinate by 5.  \n   - New position: (3, -5).\n\n5. **Take 3 steps left.**  \n   - Moving left decreases the x-coordinate by 3.  \n   - New position: (0, -5).\n\n6. **Take 5 steps backward.**  \n   - Moving backward decreases the y-coordinate by 5.  \n   - New position: (0, -10).\n\n7. **Take 10 steps forward.**  \n   - Moving forward increases the y-coordinate by 10.  \n   - New position: (0, 0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, the final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
