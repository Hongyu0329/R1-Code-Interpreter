    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at position 0.\n\n2. **Always face forward**: This means your orientation does not change; you are always facing the same direction.\n\n3. **Take 8 steps backward**: \n   - Since you are facing forward, taking steps backward means moving in the opposite direction.\n   - If forward is positive, backward is negative.\n   - Move from position 0 to position -8.\n\n4. **Take 2 steps backward**:\n   - Continue moving in the backward direction.\n   - Move from position -8 to position -10.\n\n5. **Take 10 steps forward**:\n   - Now move in the forward direction.\n   - Move from position -10 to position 0.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
