    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point (0, 0) facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume you start facing north.\n\n2. **Take 5 steps**: \n   - If facing north, you move 5 steps north. \n   - New position: (0, 5).\n\n3. **Turn around**: \n   - Turning around means you now face south.\n\n4. **Take 10 steps**: \n   - Moving 10 steps south from (0, 5) brings you to (0, -5).\n\n5. **Turn right**: \n   - If you were facing south, turning right means you now face west.\n\n6. **Take 10 steps**: \n   - Moving 10 steps west from (0, -5) brings you to (-10, -5).\n\nNow, let's determine if you have returned to the starting point:\n\n- Starting point: (0, 0)\n- Final position: (-10, -5)\n\nSince the final position is not the same as the starting point, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
