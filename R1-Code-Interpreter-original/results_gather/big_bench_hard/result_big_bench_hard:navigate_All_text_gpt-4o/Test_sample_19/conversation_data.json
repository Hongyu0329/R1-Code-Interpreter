    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of movements and determine if they lead back to the starting point. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume we start at a point (0, 0) facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume we start facing \"north\" (upwards on a grid).\n\n2. **Take 8 steps**: \n   - Moving north, we move 8 steps forward. \n   - New position: (0, 8).\n\n3. **Turn left**: \n   - Turning left from north means we now face \"west\" (left on a grid).\n\n4. **Take 9 steps**: \n   - Moving west, we move 9 steps forward.\n   - New position: (-9, 8).\n\n5. **Take 7 steps**: \n   - Still facing west, we move 7 more steps forward.\n   - New position: (-16, 8).\n\n6. **Turn around**: \n   - Turning around from west means we now face \"east\" (right on a grid).\n\nNow, let's determine if we are back at the starting point:\n\n- Starting point: (0, 0)\n- Current position: (-16, 8)\n\nClearly, the current position is not the same as the starting point. Therefore, we do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
