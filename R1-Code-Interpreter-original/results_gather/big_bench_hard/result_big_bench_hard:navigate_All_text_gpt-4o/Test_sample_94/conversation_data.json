    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume you start facing north.\n\n2. **Turn left**: Now you are facing west.\n\n3. **Turn left**: Now you are facing south.\n\n4. **Take 10 steps**: Move 10 steps south.\n\n5. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps south. You have now moved a total of 16 steps south.\n\n6. **Turn left**: Now you are facing east.\n\n7. **Take 3 steps**: Move 3 steps east.\n\n8. **Take 3 steps**: Move 3 steps east. You have now moved a total of 6 steps east.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the final position relative to the starting point:\n\n- You moved 16 steps south and 6 steps east from the starting point.\n\nTo return to the starting point, you would need to move 16 steps north and 6 steps west, which you did not do. Therefore, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
