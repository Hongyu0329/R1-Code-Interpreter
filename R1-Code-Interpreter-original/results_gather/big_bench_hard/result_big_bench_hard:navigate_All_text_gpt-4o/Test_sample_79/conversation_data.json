    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at position 0.\n\n2. **Take 10 steps forward**: \n   - Starting from 0, moving 10 steps forward takes you to position 10.\n\n3. **Take 4 steps forward**: \n   - From position 10, moving 4 steps forward takes you to position 14.\n\n4. **Take 7 steps backward**: \n   - From position 14, moving 7 steps backward takes you to position 7.\n\n5. **Take 7 steps backward**: \n   - From position 7, moving 7 steps backward takes you to position 0.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes,\" you do return to the starting point.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
