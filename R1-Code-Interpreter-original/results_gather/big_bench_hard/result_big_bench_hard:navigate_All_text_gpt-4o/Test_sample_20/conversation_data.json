    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze each instruction step by step:\n\n1. **Always face forward.**  \n   - This instruction sets the initial direction. Let's assume \"forward\" is facing north.\n\n2. **Take 6 steps backward.**  \n   - Since you are facing north, taking 6 steps backward means moving south 6 steps.\n\n3. **Take 6 steps forward.**  \n   - Now, you move 6 steps forward, which is north, returning you to the original north-south position.\n\n4. **Take 6 steps right.**  \n   - Facing north, taking 6 steps to the right means moving east 6 steps.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the net movement:\n\n- **North-South Movement:**  \n  - 6 steps backward (south) + 6 steps forward (north) = 0 net movement. You are back to the original north-south position.\n\n- **East-West Movement:**  \n  - 0 initial movement + 6 steps right (east) = 6 steps east.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you are 6 steps east of the starting point. Therefore, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
