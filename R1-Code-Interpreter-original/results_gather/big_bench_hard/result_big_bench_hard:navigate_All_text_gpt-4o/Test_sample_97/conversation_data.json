    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the movements step by step and see if they cancel each other out.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin point (0, 0).\n\n2. **Take 9 steps right**: \n   - Moving right increases the x-coordinate.\n   - New position: (9, 0).\n\n3. **Take 6 steps right**: \n   - Continue moving right, further increasing the x-coordinate.\n   - New position: (15, 0).\n\n4. **Take 10 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward decreases the y-coordinate.\n   - New position: (15, -10).\n\n5. **Take 9 steps left**: \n   - Moving left decreases the x-coordinate.\n   - New position: (6, -10).\n\n6. **Take 4 steps left**: \n   - Continue moving left, further decreasing the x-coordinate.\n   - New position: (2, -10).\n\nAfter analyzing each step, the final position is (2, -10). This position is not the same as the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
