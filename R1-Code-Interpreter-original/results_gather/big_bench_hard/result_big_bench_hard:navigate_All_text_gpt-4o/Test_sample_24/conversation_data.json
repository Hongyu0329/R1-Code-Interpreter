    "To analyze the question, let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a position labeled as 0.\n\n2. **Always face forward**: This instruction implies that the direction you are facing does not change throughout the process. You are always facing the same direction, which we will assume is forward.\n\n3. **Take 2 steps backward**: Since you are facing forward, taking steps backward means moving in the opposite direction. If forward is positive, backward is negative. Therefore, taking 2 steps backward moves you to position -2.\n\n4. **Take 8 steps backward**: Continuing to face forward, taking 8 more steps backward means moving further in the negative direction. From position -2, moving 8 steps backward takes you to position -10.\n\n5. **Return to the starting point?**: The starting point was position 0. After taking the steps as instructed, you are at position -10. Therefore, you have not returned to the starting point.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
