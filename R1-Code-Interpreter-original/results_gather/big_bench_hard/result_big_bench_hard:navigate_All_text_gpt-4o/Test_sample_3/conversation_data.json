    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point labeled as 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **Always face forward**: This means you are facing in one direction throughout the process.\n\n3. **Take 1 step right**: \n   - Facing forward, taking 1 step to the right means moving from 0 to 1 on the number line.\n\n4. **Take 3 steps left**: \n   - From position 1, taking 3 steps to the left means moving from 1 to 0, then to -1, and finally to -2 on the number line.\n\n5. **Take 2 steps right**: \n   - From position -2, taking 2 steps to the right means moving from -2 to -1, and then to 0 on the number line.\n\nAfter following all the steps, you end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
