    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start facing forward at the origin point (0,0) on a grid.\n\n2. **Take 7 steps right**: \n   - Facing forward, right is to your right-hand side.\n   - Move 7 steps to the right on the x-axis.\n   - New position: (7,0).\n\n3. **Take 1 step forward**:\n   - Move 1 step forward on the y-axis.\n   - New position: (7,1).\n\n4. **Take 3 steps left**:\n   - Facing forward, left is to your left-hand side.\n   - Move 3 steps to the left on the x-axis.\n   - New position: (4,1).\n\n5. **Take 2 steps left**:\n   - Continue moving left on the x-axis.\n   - Move 2 more steps to the left.\n   - New position: (2,1).\n\nNow, compare the final position (2,1) with the starting point (0,0). Since the final position is not the same as the starting point, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
