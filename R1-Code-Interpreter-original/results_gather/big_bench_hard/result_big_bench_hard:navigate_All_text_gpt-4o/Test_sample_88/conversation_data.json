    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the instructions step by step and analyze the movements to determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume we start at a point facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume we start facing north.\n\n2. **Turn left**: From facing north, turning left means we now face west.\n\n3. **Turn right**: From facing west, turning right means we now face north again.\n\n4. **Take 8 steps**: Moving 8 steps north.\n\n5. **Take 4 steps**: Moving 4 steps north. Total steps north = 8 + 4 = 12 steps.\n\n6. **Turn right**: From facing north, turning right means we now face east.\n\n7. **Turn right**: From facing east, turning right means we now face south.\n\n8. **Take 10 steps**: Moving 10 steps south. Since we had moved 12 steps north, moving 10 steps south means we are now 2 steps north of the starting point.\n\n9. **Take 1 step**: Moving 1 step south. Now we are 1 step north of the starting point.\n\n10. **Take 1 step**: Moving 1 step south. Now we are back at the starting point.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, we have returned to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
