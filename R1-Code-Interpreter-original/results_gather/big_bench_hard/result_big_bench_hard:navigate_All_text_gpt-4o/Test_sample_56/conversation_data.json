    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point facing a certain direction (let's say north for simplicity).\n\n2. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 steps forward in the initial direction (north).\n\n3. **Turn left**: Change direction 90 degrees to the left (now facing west).\n\n4. **Turn left**: Change direction 90 degrees to the left again (now facing south).\n\n5. **Take 5 steps**: Move 5 steps forward in the current direction (south).\n\n6. **Take 4 steps**: Move 4 steps forward in the same direction (south).\n\n7. **Turn left**: Change direction 90 degrees to the left (now facing east).\n\n8. **Turn left**: Change direction 90 degrees to the left again (now facing north).\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initially, you moved 9 steps north.\n- Then, you moved 5 + 4 = 9 steps south.\n\nSince you moved 9 steps north and then 9 steps south, you have returned to the original north-south position.\n\n- The turns and the final direction do not affect the position, only the orientation.\n\nTherefore, you have returned to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
