    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at position 0.\n\n2. **Take 4 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward means increasing your position.\n   - New position = 0 + 4 = 4.\n\n3. **Take 2 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward means decreasing your position.\n   - New position = 4 - 2 = 2.\n\n4. **Take 10 steps backward**: \n   - Again, moving backward decreases your position.\n   - New position = 2 - 10 = -8.\n\nNow, let's evaluate if you return to the starting point:\n\n- The starting point was position 0.\n- After all the steps, your final position is -8.\n\nSince the final position (-8) is not equal to the starting point (0), you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
