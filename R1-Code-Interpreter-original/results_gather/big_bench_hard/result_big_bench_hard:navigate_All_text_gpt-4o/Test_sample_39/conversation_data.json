    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Always face forward.**  \n   - This instruction implies that your orientation does not change throughout the process. You are always facing the same direction.\n\n2. **Take 2 steps forward.**  \n   - Since you are facing forward, taking 2 steps forward means you move 2 steps in the direction you are facing.\n\n3. **Take 2 steps backward.**  \n   - Taking 2 steps backward means you move 2 steps in the opposite direction of where you are facing. Since you initially moved 2 steps forward, moving 2 steps backward will bring you back to your original starting point.\n\nNow, let's summarize the movement:\n- You start at the starting point.\n- Move 2 steps forward.\n- Move 2 steps backward.\n\nAfter these movements, you end up at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point?\" is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
