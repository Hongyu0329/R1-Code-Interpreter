    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the instructions step by step and analyze the movements to determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's assume you start facing north.\n\n2. **Turn Right**: From facing north, turning right means you now face east.\n\n3. **Take 3 Steps**: Moving 3 steps east means you are now 3 units east of the starting point.\n\n4. **Turn Around**: Turning around from facing east means you now face west.\n\n5. **Take 3 Steps**: Moving 3 steps west means you return to the original east-west position, which is the starting point.\n\n6. **Turn Left**: From facing west, turning left means you now face south.\n\nNow, let's analyze if you return to the starting point:\n\n- After taking 3 steps east and then 3 steps west, you are back at the original east-west position.\n- The final instruction to turn left does not involve any movement, so it does not affect your position.\n\nTherefore, you are indeed back at the starting point.\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes"
