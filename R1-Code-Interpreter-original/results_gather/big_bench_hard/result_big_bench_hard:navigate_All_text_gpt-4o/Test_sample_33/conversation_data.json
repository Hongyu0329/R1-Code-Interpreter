    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the movements step by step, considering the direction changes and the number of steps taken in each direction.\n\n1. **Initial Position and Direction:**\n   - Start at the origin (0, 0).\n   - Assume facing North (positive y-direction).\n\n2. **Take 3 steps:**\n   - Move 3 steps North.\n   - New position: (0, 3).\n\n3. **Take 5 steps:**\n   - Continue moving North.\n   - New position: (0, 8).\n\n4. **Take 8 steps:**\n   - Continue moving North.\n   - New position: (0, 16).\n\n5. **Turn right:**\n   - Now facing East (positive x-direction).\n\n6. **Turn right:**\n   - Now facing South (negative y-direction).\n\n7. **Take 5 steps:**\n   - Move 5 steps South.\n   - New position: (0, 11).\n\n8. **Turn around:**\n   - Now facing North again (positive y-direction).\n\n9. **Take 2 steps:**\n   - Move 2 steps North.\n   - New position: (0, 13).\n\n10. **Take 4 steps:**\n    - Continue moving North.\n    - New position: (0, 17).\n\nAfter analyzing each step, the final position is (0, 17), which is not the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
