    "To determine if you return to the starting point after following the given instructions, we need to analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the initial point, which we can consider as position 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **First Instruction**: \"Take 4 steps.\"\n   - Move 4 steps forward from the starting point.\n   - New position: 0 + 4 = 4\n\n3. **Second Instruction**: \"Take 2 steps.\"\n   - Move 2 steps forward from the current position.\n   - New position: 4 + 2 = 6\n\n4. **Third Instruction**: \"Take 7 steps.\"\n   - Move 7 steps forward from the current position.\n   - New position: 6 + 7 = 13\n\nAfter following all the instructions, the final position is 13. \n\nTo determine if you return to the starting point, we compare the final position with the initial position:\n\n- Initial position: 0\n- Final position: 13\n\nSince the final position (13) is not equal to the initial position (0), you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
