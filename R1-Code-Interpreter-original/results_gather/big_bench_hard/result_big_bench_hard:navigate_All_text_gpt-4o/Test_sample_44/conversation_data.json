    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Always face forward.**  \n   - This means you are consistently moving in one direction, which we will consider as the positive direction.\n\n2. **Take 7 steps forward.**  \n   - You move 7 steps in the positive direction.  \n   - Position: +7\n\n3. **Take 7 steps backward.**  \n   - You move 7 steps in the negative direction (opposite to forward).  \n   - Position: +7 - 7 = 0\n\n4. **Take 10 steps backward.**  \n   - You move 10 steps in the negative direction.  \n   - Position: 0 - 10 = -10\n\n5. **Take 10 steps forward.**  \n   - You move 10 steps in the positive direction.  \n   - Position: -10 + 10 = 0\n\nAfter analyzing each step, we find that the final position is 0, which means you have returned to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
