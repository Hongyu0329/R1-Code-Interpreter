    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Always face forward.**  \n   - This implies that the direction you are facing does not change throughout the instructions.\n\n2. **Take 8 steps forward.**  \n   - You move 8 steps in the forward direction.\n\n3. **Take 5 steps backward.**  \n   - You move 5 steps in the opposite direction of forward, effectively reducing your forward movement by 5 steps.\n\n4. **Take 5 steps left.**  \n   - You move 5 steps to the left of your current position. This is perpendicular to the forward/backward direction.\n\n5. **Take 5 steps forward.**  \n   - You move 5 steps in the forward direction again.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement in each direction:\n\n- **Forward/Backward Direction:**\n  - Initial 8 steps forward.\n  - 5 steps backward reduces the net forward movement to 3 steps forward (8 - 5 = 3).\n  - Additional 5 steps forward results in a total of 8 steps forward (3 + 5 = 8).\n\n- **Left/Right Direction:**\n  - 5 steps left.\n\nFinal position relative to the starting point:\n- You are 8 steps forward and 5 steps left from the starting point.\n\nSince you are not at the starting point (you are 8 steps forward and 5 steps left), the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
