    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at position 0.\n\n2. **Take 9 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward means increasing your position.\n   - New position = 0 + 9 = 9.\n\n3. **Take 1 step backward**: \n   - Moving backward means decreasing your position.\n   - New position = 9 - 1 = 8.\n\n4. **Take 4 steps backward**: \n   - New position = 8 - 4 = 4.\n\n5. **Take 4 steps backward**: \n   - New position = 4 - 4 = 0.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
