    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 7 steps.**  \n   - You move 7 steps forward from the starting point.\n\n2. **Turn around.**  \n   - You are now facing the opposite direction from where you started.\n\n3. **Take 10 steps.**  \n   - Since you turned around, you move 10 steps in the opposite direction.  \n   - From the starting point, you have now moved 3 steps away (10 - 7 = 3 steps in the opposite direction).\n\n4. **Take 2 steps.**  \n   - You continue in the same direction and move 2 more steps.  \n   - You are now 5 steps away from the starting point in the opposite direction (3 + 2 = 5).\n\n5. **Turn around.**  \n   - You turn around again, facing the original direction.\n\n6. **Take 5 steps.**  \n   - You move 5 steps in the original direction.  \n   - Since you were 5 steps away in the opposite direction, moving 5 steps in the original direction brings you back to the starting point.\n\n7. **Turn left.**  \n   - This changes your orientation but does not affect your position.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you are back at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
