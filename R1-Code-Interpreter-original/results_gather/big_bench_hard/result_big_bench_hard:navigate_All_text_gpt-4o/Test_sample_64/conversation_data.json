    "To solve this problem, let's break down the instructions step by step and analyze the movements:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point facing a certain direction. For simplicity, let's say you are facing north.\n\n2. **Turn Left**: From facing north, turning left means you are now facing west.\n\n3. **Take 4 Steps**: Moving 4 steps in the direction you are facing (west) means you move 4 units to the left from your starting point.\n\n4. **Turn Around**: Turning around from facing west means you now face east.\n\n5. **Take 4 Steps**: Moving 4 steps in the direction you are facing (east) means you move 4 units to the right.\n\nNow, let's analyze the net movement:\n\n- Initially, you moved 4 steps to the left (west).\n- Then, you moved 4 steps to the right (east).\n\nSince you moved 4 steps to the left and then 4 steps to the right, you end up at the same horizontal position as your starting point.\n\nTherefore, you do return to the starting point.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
