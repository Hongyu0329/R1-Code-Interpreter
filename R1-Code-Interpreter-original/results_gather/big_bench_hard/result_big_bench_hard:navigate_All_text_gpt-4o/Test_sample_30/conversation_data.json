    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 7 steps**: You move 7 steps in a straight line from the starting point.\n\n2. **Take 7 steps**: You continue in the same direction for another 7 steps. Now, you have moved a total of 14 steps in a straight line from the starting point.\n\n3. **Take 10 steps**: You continue in the same direction for another 10 steps. Now, you have moved a total of 24 steps in a straight line from the starting point.\n\n4. **Take 1 step**: You continue in the same direction for another 1 step. Now, you have moved a total of 25 steps in a straight line from the starting point.\n\n5. **Turn left**: You change your direction by 90 degrees to the left.\n\n6. **Take 7 steps**: You move 7 steps in the new direction (perpendicular to the original direction).\n\nNow, let's consider the overall movement:\n\n- Initially, you moved 25 steps in one direction.\n- Then, you turned left and moved 7 steps in a perpendicular direction.\n\nTo return to the starting point, you would need to undo the 25 steps in the original direction and the 7 steps in the perpendicular direction. Since you have not taken any steps to reverse the initial 25 steps, you are not back at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
