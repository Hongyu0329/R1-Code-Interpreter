    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the instructions and determine if following them will return us to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you are facing forward at the starting point.\n\n2. **Take 6 steps left**: \n   - If you are facing forward, turning left means you are now facing to your left side.\n   - Take 6 steps in this new direction (left from the original forward direction).\n\n3. **Take 3 steps backward**:\n   - From your current position (6 steps to the left of the starting point), taking 3 steps backward means you move in the opposite direction of where you are currently facing.\n   - Since you are facing left, moving backward means you move to the right (relative to your original forward direction).\n   - So, you move 3 steps to the right from your current position.\n\n4. **Take 3 steps left**:\n   - You are still facing left from the original forward direction.\n   - Take 3 more steps in the left direction from your current position.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement from the starting point:\n\n- Initially, you moved 6 steps to the left.\n- Then, you moved 3 steps to the right (backward from your left-facing direction).\n- Finally, you moved 3 steps to the left again.\n\nNet movement:\n- 6 steps left - 3 steps right + 3 steps left = 6 steps left.\n\nSince the net movement is 6 steps to the left, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
