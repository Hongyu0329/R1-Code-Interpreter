    "To analyze the question, let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a specific point, which we'll call Point A.\n\n2. **Take 8 Steps**: Move 8 steps in a straight line from Point A. Let's call the new position Point B.\n\n3. **Turn Around**: This instruction means to turn 180 degrees, facing the opposite direction from the one you were facing when you moved from Point A to Point B.\n\n4. **Take 8 Steps**: Move 8 steps in the direction you are now facing (which is back towards Point A). After taking these 8 steps, you should arrive back at Point A.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n- **Yes**: This option would be correct if you return to the starting point after following the instructions.\n- **No**: This option would be correct if you do not return to the starting point after following the instructions.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, after taking 8 steps from Point A to Point B, turning around, and taking another 8 steps, you will indeed return to Point A, the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
