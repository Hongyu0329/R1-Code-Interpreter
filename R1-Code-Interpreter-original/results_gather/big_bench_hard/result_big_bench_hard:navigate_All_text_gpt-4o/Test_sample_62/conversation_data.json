    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the instructions step by step and track the position and direction at each step.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at the origin (0, 0) facing forward (north).\n\n2. **Take 7 steps left**: \n   - Turning left from north means you face west.\n   - Move 7 steps west: Position = (-7, 0).\n\n3. **Take 8 steps left**: \n   - Turning left from west means you face south.\n   - Move 8 steps south: Position = (-7, -8).\n\n4. **Take 1 step left**: \n   - Turning left from south means you face east.\n   - Move 1 step east: Position = (-6, -8).\n\n5. **Take 9 steps left**: \n   - Turning left from east means you face north.\n   - Move 9 steps north: Position = (-6, 1).\n\n6. **Take 10 steps forward**: \n   - Facing north, move 10 steps north: Position = (-6, 11).\n\n7. **Take 5 steps forward**: \n   - Still facing north, move 5 steps north: Position = (-6, 16).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, the final position is (-6, 16), which is not the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
