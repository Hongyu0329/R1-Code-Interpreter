    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 6 steps**: You move 6 steps in a certain direction from the starting point.\n\n2. **Take 8 steps**: You continue in the same direction for another 8 steps. Now, you are 14 steps away from the starting point in that direction (6 + 8 = 14).\n\n3. **Take 7 steps**: You continue in the same direction for another 7 steps. Now, you are 21 steps away from the starting point in that direction (14 + 7 = 21).\n\n4. **Turn around**: You change direction to face the opposite way.\n\n5. **Take 6 steps**: You move 6 steps in the opposite direction. Now, you are 15 steps away from the starting point in the original direction (21 - 6 = 15).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you are 15 steps away from the starting point in the original direction. Therefore, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
