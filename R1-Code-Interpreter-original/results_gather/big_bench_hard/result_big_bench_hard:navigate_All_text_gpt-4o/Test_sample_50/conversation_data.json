    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 10 steps**: You move 10 steps forward from the starting point.\n\n2. **Take 7 steps**: You move an additional 7 steps forward. Now, you are 17 steps away from the starting point.\n\n3. **Turn around**: You change direction and face the opposite way.\n\n4. **Take 8 steps**: You move 8 steps in the opposite direction. Now, you are 17 - 8 = 9 steps away from the starting point.\n\n5. **Take 9 steps**: You move 9 steps further in the same direction you were facing after turning around. Now, you are 9 - 9 = 0 steps away from the starting point.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
