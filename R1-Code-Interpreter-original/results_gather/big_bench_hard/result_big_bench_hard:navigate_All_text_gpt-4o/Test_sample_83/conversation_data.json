    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at a point facing a certain direction (let's say North for simplicity).\n\n2. **Take 2 steps**: Move 2 steps forward in the direction you are facing (North).\n\n3. **Turn around**: This means you turn 180 degrees. If you were facing North, you are now facing South.\n\n4. **Turn right**: From facing South, turning right means you now face West.\n\n5. **Turn left**: From facing West, turning left means you now face South.\n\n6. **Take 2 steps**: Move 2 steps forward in the direction you are facing (South).\n\n7. **Turn around**: Turn 180 degrees. If you were facing South, you are now facing North.\n\n8. **Turn around**: Turn 180 degrees again. If you were facing North, you are now facing South.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the net movement:\n\n- Initially, you took 2 steps North.\n- Then, you took 2 steps South.\n\nThe net movement is 0 steps in the North-South direction, meaning you are back at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
