    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the instructions and determine the final position relative to the starting point. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin at a certain point, facing forward.\n\n2. **Take 2 steps right**: \n   - Since we are facing forward, taking 2 steps to the right means we move 2 steps to the right of our starting direction.\n\n3. **Take 4 steps right**: \n   - Continuing from the last position, taking 4 more steps to the right means we move an additional 4 steps in the same rightward direction.\n\n4. **Take 6 steps left**: \n   - From the current position, taking 6 steps to the left means we move 6 steps in the opposite direction of the rightward movement.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- After taking 2 steps right, we are 2 steps to the right of the starting point.\n- After taking 4 more steps right, we are now 6 steps to the right of the starting point (2 + 4 = 6).\n- After taking 6 steps left, we move back 6 steps towards the starting point.\n\nThe net movement is:\n- 6 steps right - 6 steps left = 0 steps\n\nThis means we end up exactly at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point?\" is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
