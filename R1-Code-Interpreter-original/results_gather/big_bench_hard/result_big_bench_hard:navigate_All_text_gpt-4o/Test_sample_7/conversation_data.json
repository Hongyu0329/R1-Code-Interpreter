    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the net movement based on the instructions given. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at position 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **Take 6 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward means moving in the positive direction.\n   - Position changes from 0 to 6.\n\n3. **Take 7 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward means moving in the negative direction.\n   - Position changes from 6 to 6 - 7 = -1.\n\n4. **Take 7 steps backward**: \n   - Continue moving in the negative direction.\n   - Position changes from -1 to -1 - 7 = -8.\n\n5. **Take 8 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward again means moving in the positive direction.\n   - Position changes from -8 to -8 + 8 = 0.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, the final position is 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
