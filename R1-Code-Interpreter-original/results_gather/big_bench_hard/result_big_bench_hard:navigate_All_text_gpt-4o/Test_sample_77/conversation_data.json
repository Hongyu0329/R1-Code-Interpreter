    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to analyze the steps taken in each direction. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Always face forward**: This implies a consistent direction for forward and backward movements. Let's assume facing north for simplicity.\n\n3. **Take 1 step backward**: \n   - Facing north, a backward step is south.\n   - New position: (0, -1).\n\n4. **Take 5 steps right**: \n   - Facing north, right is east.\n   - New position: (5, -1).\n\n5. **Take 3 steps left**: \n   - Facing north, left is west.\n   - New position: (2, -1).\n\n6. **Take 1 step backward**: \n   - Facing north, a backward step is south.\n   - New position: (2, -2).\n\n7. **Take 5 steps backward**: \n   - Facing north, backward is south.\n   - New position: (2, -7).\n\n8. **Take 4 steps forward**: \n   - Facing north, forward is north.\n   - New position: (2, -3).\n\n9. **Take 3 steps forward**: \n   - Facing north, forward is north.\n   - New position: (2, 0).\n\n10. **Take 2 steps left**: \n    - Facing north, left is west.\n    - New position: (0, 0).\n\nAfter analyzing each step, the final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
