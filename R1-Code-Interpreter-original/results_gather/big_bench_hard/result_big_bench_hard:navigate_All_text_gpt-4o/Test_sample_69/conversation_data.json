    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume you start at position 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **Take 10 steps forward**: \n   - Moving forward means increasing your position.\n   - From position 0, moving 10 steps forward takes you to position 10.\n\n3. **Take 4 steps backward**: \n   - Moving backward means decreasing your position.\n   - From position 10, moving 4 steps backward takes you to position 6 (10 - 4 = 6).\n\n4. **Take 6 steps forward**: \n   - Again, moving forward means increasing your position.\n   - From position 6, moving 6 steps forward takes you to position 12 (6 + 6 = 12).\n\nNow, let's determine if you return to the starting point:\n\n- You started at position 0.\n- After following all the instructions, you end at position 12.\n\nSince position 12 is not the same as position 0, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
