    "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 6 steps**: \n   - You start at the initial point (let's call it Point A).\n   - You move 6 steps away from Point A.\n\n2. **Take 2 steps**:\n   - From your current position (6 steps away from Point A), you move an additional 2 steps in the same direction.\n   - Now, you are 8 steps away from Point A.\n\n3. **Take 6 steps**:\n   - From your current position (8 steps away from Point A), you move 6 more steps in the same direction.\n   - Now, you are 14 steps away from Point A.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you are 14 steps away from the starting point, not back at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point?\" is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
