  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=4 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n0110\n1111\n0010\n0000\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"4\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"3\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\nRound 2: Button B\nRound 3: Button B\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. We will represent the grid as a 2D list and apply the button operations in sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start with the given initial grid configuration.\n2. **Define Button Operations**: Each button has a specific set of coordinates it controls. Pressing a button toggles the state (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) of the lights at these coordinates.\n3. **Simulate Button Presses**: Apply the button operations in the given order (Round 1: Button A, Round 2: Button B, Round 3: Button B).\n4. **Output the Final Grid**: After all button presses, output the final state of the grid as a single list of values.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial grid configuration\ngrid = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Button control mappings\nbutton_A = [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (2, 1), (0, 3)]\nbutton_B = [(0, 3), (3, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0)]\nbutton_C = [(3, 0), (3, 2), (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x][y] = 1 - grid[x][y]  # Toggle the light\n\n# Simulate the rounds\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_A)  # Round 1: Button A\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_B)  # Round 2: Button B\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_B)  # Round 3: Button B\n\n# Flatten the grid to a single list\nfinal_state = [light for row in grid for light in row]\n\n# Print the final state\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the button presses and output the final state of the grid. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final state of the grid after all button operations is `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]`. This represents the grid as a single list of values, where each value corresponds to the state of a light (0 for unlit, 1 for lit).\n\n<<<0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0>>>"
