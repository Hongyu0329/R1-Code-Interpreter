  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=4 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n0110\n0111\n0111\n0000\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"1\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"3\"]\n\nRound 1: Button B\nRound 2: Button A\nRound 3: Button C\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button on the grid of lights. Each button toggles the state of specific lights, changing a 1 to a 0 and vice versa. We will apply the buttons in the given order and determine the final state of the grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start with the given initial grid configuration.\n2. **Define Button Effects**: For each button, define which lights it controls.\n3. **Simulate Button Presses**: For each round, apply the button's effect by toggling the state of the lights it controls.\n4. **Output the Final Grid**: After all rounds, output the final state of the grid as a single list of values.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial grid configuration\ngrid = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Button control mappings\nbutton_A = [(3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2), (0, 1), (2, 3), (1, 0)]\nbutton_B = [(1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 0)]\nbutton_C = [(0, 1), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x][y] = 1 - grid[x][y]\n\n# Simulate the rounds\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_B)  # Round 1: Button B\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_A)  # Round 2: Button A\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_C)  # Round 3: Button C\n\n# Flatten the grid to a single list\nfinal_state = [grid[i][j] for i in range(4) for j in range(4)]\n\n# Print the final state\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the button presses and output the final state of the grid. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final state of the grid after all button presses is represented as a single list of values. Each value corresponds to the state of a light in the grid, with 1 indicating a lit light and 0 indicating an unlit light.\n\nThe final state of the grid is:\n\n<<<1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1>>>"
