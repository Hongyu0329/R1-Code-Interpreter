  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=5 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n01001\n11000\n10001\n01011\n00001\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"3\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"5\", \"3\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"3\"]\n\nRound 1: Button B\nRound 2: Button C\nRound 3: Button A\nRound 4: Button C\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button in sequence on the grid. Each button press will toggle the state of the lights it controls. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start with the given initial grid configuration.\n2. **Define Button Controls**: Map each button to the lights it controls.\n3. **Simulate Button Presses**: For each round, toggle the lights controlled by the button being pressed.\n4. **Output the Final Grid**: After all rounds, output the final state of the grid as a single list of values.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial grid configuration\ngrid = [\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n]\n\n# Button controls\nbutton_A = [(3, 4), (3, 2), (4, 4), (2, 4), (5, 5), (1, 4), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3)]\nbutton_B = [(1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (4, 4), (2, 1), (3, 2), (5, 3)]\nbutton_C = [(1, 1), (2, 3)]\n\n# Convert 1-based to 0-based indices\nbutton_A = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_A]\nbutton_B = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_B]\nbutton_C = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_C]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x][y] = 1 - grid[x][y]\n\n# Simulate the rounds\nrounds = [button_B, button_C, button_A, button_C]\n\nfor button in rounds:\n    toggle_lights(grid, button)\n\n# Flatten the grid to a single list\nfinal_state = [grid[i][j] for i in range(5) for j in range(5)]\n\n# Print the final state\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the button presses and output the final state of the grid. Let's execute it to see the result.",
