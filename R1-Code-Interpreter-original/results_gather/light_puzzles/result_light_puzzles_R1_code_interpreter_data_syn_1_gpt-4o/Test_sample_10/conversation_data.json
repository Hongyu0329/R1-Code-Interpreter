  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid of lights. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. We will represent the grid as a 2D list and apply the button operations in sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start with the given initial grid configuration.\n2. **Define Button Operations**: Create a function to toggle the lights controlled by each button.\n3. **Simulate Button Presses**: Apply the button operations in the given order for each round.\n4. **Output the Final Grid**: After all operations, output the final state of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial grid configuration\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Button control mappings\nbutton_A = [(1, 1), (4, 4), (1, 4), (4, 2), (3, 4), (1, 3)]\nbutton_B = [(5, 3), (3, 5), (3, 3), (5, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (4, 3), (2, 1)]\nbutton_C = [(2, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (2, 4), (2, 1), (5, 4), (4, 5), (4, 2), (1, 3)]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x-1][y-1] = 1 - grid[x-1][y-1]  # Toggle the light\n\n# Simulate the rounds\nrounds = ['C', 'C', 'C', 'B']\nfor round in rounds:\n    if round == 'A':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_A)\n    elif round == 'B':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_B)\n    elif round == 'C':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_C)\n\n# Flatten the grid to a single list\nfinal_state = [light for row in grid for light in row]\n\n# Print the final state\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the button presses and output the final state of the grid. Let's execute it to see the result.",
