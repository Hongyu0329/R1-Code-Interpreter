  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid of lights. Each button press toggles the state of specific lights (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). We will perform the operations in the given order and determine the final state of the grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup**: We start with the given 4x4 grid:\n   ```\n   0 1 0 1\n   0 1 0 0\n   1 0 1 1\n   0 0 1 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Button A Operations**: Button A toggles the lights at positions [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"3\"].\n   - Convert these positions to zero-based indices: (0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2).\n   - Toggle the lights at these positions.\n\n3. **Button B Operations**: Button B toggles the lights at positions [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"1\"].\n   - Convert these positions to zero-based indices: (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (3, 0).\n   - Toggle the lights at these positions.\n\n4. **Repeat Button A Operations**: Perform the same toggling as in step 2.\n\n5. **Final Grid**: After all operations, convert the grid to a single list of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the final state of the grid.\n\n```python\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    [0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x][y] = 1 - grid[x][y]  # Toggle the light\n\n# Button A positions (zero-based)\nbutton_a_positions = [(0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2)]\n\n# Button B positions (zero-based)\nbutton_b_positions = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (3, 0)]\n\n# Round 1: Button A\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_a_positions)\n\n# Round 2: Button B\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_b_positions)\n\n# Round 3: Button A\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_a_positions)\n\n# Flatten the grid to a single list\nfinal_state = [grid[i][j] for i in range(4) for j in range(4)]\n\n# Print the final state\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final state of the grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final state of the grid after all the button operations is:\n\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\nFlattening this grid into a single list, we get:\n\n<<<0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0>>>"
