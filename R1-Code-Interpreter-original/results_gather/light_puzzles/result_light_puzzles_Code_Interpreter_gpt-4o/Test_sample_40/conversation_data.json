  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=5 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n10100\n11011\n01110\n00111\n11111\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"1\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"5\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"3\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"2\"]\n\nRound 1: Button C\nRound 2: Button A\nRound 3: Button A\nRound 4: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls (i.e., changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the grid with the given initial state.\n2. Define the positions each button controls.\n3. Simulate each round by toggling the lights controlled by the button pressed in that round.\n4.
