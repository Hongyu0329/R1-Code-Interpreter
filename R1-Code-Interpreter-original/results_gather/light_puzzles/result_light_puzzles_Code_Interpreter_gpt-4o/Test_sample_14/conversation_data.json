  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid of lights. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls (i.e., changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the grid with the given initial state.\n2. Define the positions each button controls.\n3. Simulate each round by toggling the lights controlled by the button pressed in that round.\n4.
