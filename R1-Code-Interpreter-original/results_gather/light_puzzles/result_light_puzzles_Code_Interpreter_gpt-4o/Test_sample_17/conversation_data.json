    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button on the grid of lights. Each button press will toggle the state of the lights it controls. A light that is on (1) will be turned off (0), and a light that is off (0) will be turned on (1).\n\nLet's start by representing the initial grid and the positions controlled by each button. Then, we'll simulate each round of button presses and update the grid accordingly.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Initialize the grid with the given initial state.\n2. Define the positions controlled by each button.\n3. Simulate each round of button presses, updating the grid by toggling the state of the lights at the specified positions.\n4. Output the final state of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial grid state\ngrid = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# Positions controlled by each button (1-based index)\nbutton_A_positions = [(1, 3), (5, 4), (3, 3), (5, 3), (2, 1)]\nbutton_B_positions = [(1, 1), (2, 4), (2, 2), (1, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2), (3, 2)]\nbutton_C_positions = [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (5, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (3, 5), (2, 1), (4, 4), (1, 3), (4, 5)]\n\n# Function to toggle lights at specified positions\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x-1, y-1] = 1 - grid[x-1, y-1]  # Toggle the light (1-based to 0-based index)\n    return grid\n\n# Simulate each round of button presses\nrounds = ['B', 'C', 'A', 'A']\nfor round in rounds:\n    if round == 'A':\n        grid = toggle_lights(grid, button_A_positions)\n    elif round == 'B':\n        grid = toggle_lights(grid, button_B_positions)\n    elif round == 'C':\n        grid = toggle_lights(grid, button_C_positions)\n\n# Output the final state of the grid\ngrid.flatten().tolist()\nassistant > After simulating all the rounds of button presses, the final state of the grid is:\n\n\\[ [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] \\]\n\nThis represents the grid as a flattened list, where each element corresponds to the state of a light (0 for unlit, 1 for lit) in row-major order."
