    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. Let's go through the steps to determine the final state of the grid after all rounds of button presses.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (2, 4), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (3, 3), (3, 2), (1, 4), (3, 1)\n\n### Rounds\n- **Round 1**: Press Button B\n- **Round 2**: Press Button B\n- **Round 3**: Press Button B\n\n### Toggle Logic\nPressing a button toggles the state of the lights it controls. If a light is on (1), it turns off (0), and if it is off (0), it turns on (1).\n\nLet's simulate the button presses and determine the final state of the grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0]\n])\n\n# Button B controls these positions (1-based index)\nbutton_b_positions = [(3, 3), (3, 2), (1, 4), (3, 1)]\n\n# Convert to 0-based index for numpy array\nbutton_b_positions = [(r-1, c-1) for r, c in button_b_positions]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for r, c in positions:\n        grid[r, c] = 1 - grid[r, c]  # Toggle the light\n    return grid\n\n# Simulate the rounds\nfor _ in range(3):  # Press Button B three times\n    grid = toggle_lights(grid, button_b_positions)\n\n# Flatten the grid to represent the final state\nfinal_state = grid.flatten()\nfinal_state_list = final_state.tolist()\nfinal_state_list\nassistant > After simulating the button presses, the final state of the grid is:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n```\n\nRepresented as a flattened list, the final state is:\n\\[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0\\]"
