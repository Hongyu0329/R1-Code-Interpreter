    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button on the grid. Each button toggles the state of specific lights, meaning if a light is on (1), it will be turned off (0), and if it is off (0), it will be turned on (1).\n\nLet's start by defining the initial grid and the positions each button controls. Then, we'll simulate each round by toggling the lights controlled by the respective button.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Define the initial grid.\n2. Define the positions each button controls.\n3. Simulate each round by toggling the lights at the specified positions.\n4. Output the final state of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# Button control positions (1-based index)\nbutton_A_positions = [(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 4), (5, 1), (4, 5), (3, 4), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]\nbutton_B_positions = [(1, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)]\nbutton_C_positions = [(2, 2), (3, 3), (5, 3), (1, 3), (4, 3), (4, 5), (2, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (1, 2)]\n\n# Convert 1-based index to 0-based index for numpy array\nbutton_A_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_A_positions]\nbutton_B_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_B_positions]\nbutton_C_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_C_positions]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x, y] = 1 - grid[x, y]  # Toggle the light\n    return grid\n\n# Simulate each round\nrounds = ['C', 'B', 'C', 'C']\nfor round in rounds:\n    if round == 'A':\n        grid = toggle_lights(grid, button_A_positions)\n    elif round == 'B':\n        grid = toggle_lights(grid, button_B_positions)\n    elif round == 'C':\n        grid = toggle_lights(grid, button_C_positions)\n\ngrid\nassistant > After simulating all the rounds, the final state of the grid is:\n\n```\n00100\n10000\n10000\n10110\n01010\n```\n\nThis represents the state of the lights after pressing the buttons in the specified order."
