    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button on the grid. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. A light that is on (1) will be turned off (0), and a light that is off (0) will be turned on (1).\n\nLet's start by defining the initial grid and the positions controlled by each button. Then, we'll simulate each round of button presses and update the grid accordingly. Finally, we'll output the resulting grid after all rounds.\n\nHere's the step-by-step implementation:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# Button control positions (1-based index)\nbutton_A_positions = [(2, 5), (5, 5), (5, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (5, 3), (5, 1)]\nbutton_B_positions = [(1, 4), (2, 4), (5, 1), (3, 5), (2, 3), (5, 2), (4, 5), (3, 4), (1, 1), (4, 4), (4, 3), (1, 5)]\nbutton_C_positions = [(4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 1), (3, 5), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2), (2, 4)]\n\n# Convert positions to 0-based index for numpy array\nbutton_A_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_A_positions]\nbutton_B_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_B_positions]\nbutton_C_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_C_positions]\n\n# Function to toggle lights controlled by a button\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x, y] = 1 - grid[x, y]  # Toggle the light (0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0)\n\n# Simulate each round of button presses\nrounds = ['C', 'A', 'A', 'A']\nfor round in rounds:\n    if round == 'A':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_A_positions)\n    elif round == 'B':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_B_positions)\n    elif round == 'C':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_C_positions)\n\ngrid\nassistant > After simulating all the rounds of button presses, the resulting grid is:\n\n```\n00101\n00101\n11111\n10100\n10000\n```\n\nThis represents the final state of the light network after all the specified button operations."
