    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button on the grid. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls (i.e., changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the grid with the given initial state.\n2. Define the positions each button controls.\n3. Simulate each round by toggling the lights controlled by the respective button.\n4. Output the final state of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial grid state\ngrid = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# Button control positions (1-based index)\nbutton_A_positions = [(4, 3), (5, 5)]\nbutton_B_positions = [(1, 4), (5, 4), (2, 4), (2, 1), (4, 4)]\nbutton_C_positions = [(3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (1, 5), (2, 3), (1, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (2, 5), (2, 1)]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x-1, y-1] = 1 - grid[x-1, y-1]  # Toggle the light\n\n# Simulate each round\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_A_positions)  # Round 1: Button A\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_A_positions)  # Round 2: Button A\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_B_positions)  # Round 3: Button B\ntoggle_lights(grid, button_C_positions)  # Round 4: Button C\n\n# Output the final grid state\ngrid.flatten().tolist()\nassistant > After simulating all the rounds of button presses, the final state of the grid is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1>>>} \\]\n\nThis represents the grid as a flattened list, where each element corresponds to the state of a light (0 for unlit, 1 for lit)."
