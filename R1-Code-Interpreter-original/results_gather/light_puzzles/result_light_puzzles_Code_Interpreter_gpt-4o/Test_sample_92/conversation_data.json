    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button on the grid. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls (i.e., changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start with the given initial grid.\n2. **Define Button Controls**: Map each button to the lights it controls.\n3. **Simulate Button Presses**: For each round, toggle the lights controlled by the button pressed in that round.\n4. **Output the Final Grid**: After all rounds, output the final state of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\n# Button controls\nbutton_controls = {\n    'A': [(2, 2), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3)],\n    'B': [(0, 1), (3, 0), (2, 2)],\n    'C': [(0, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0)]\n}\n\n# Rounds of button presses\nrounds = ['B', 'C', 'C']\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x, y] = 1 - grid[x, y]  # Toggle between 0 and 1\n\n# Simulate each round\nfor button in rounds:\n    toggle_lights(grid, button_controls[button])\n\n# Flatten the grid to a single list\nfinal_state = grid.flatten().tolist()\nfinal_state\nassistant > After simulating all the rounds of button presses, the final state of the grid is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0>>>} \\]\n\nThis represents the grid as a single list, where each element corresponds to the state of a light (0 for unlit, 1 for lit) in row-major order."
