  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=5 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n10101\n01001\n11001\n01101\n10100\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"5\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"5\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"5\", \"1\"], [\"5\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"4\", \"1\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"5\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"3\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\nRound 2: Button C\nRound 3: Button C\nRound 4: Button B\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",
