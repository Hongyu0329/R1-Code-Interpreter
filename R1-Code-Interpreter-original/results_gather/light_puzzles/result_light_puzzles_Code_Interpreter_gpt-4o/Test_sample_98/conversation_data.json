    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. A light that is on (1) will be turned off (0), and a light that is off (0) will be turned on (1).\n\nLet's start by representing the initial grid and the lights controlled by each button. Then, we'll simulate each round of button presses and update the grid accordingly.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the grid with the given initial state.\n2. Define the positions controlled by each button.\n3. For each round, toggle the lights controlled by the pressed button.\n4. Output the final state of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial grid state\ngrid = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0]\n])\n\n# Button control positions (1-based index)\nbutton_A_positions = [(2, 3), (4, 2), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 1), (4, 3)]\nbutton_B_positions = [(1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (3, 4)]\nbutton_C_positions = [(3, 2), (4, 4), (3, 1), (1, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 4)]\n\n# Convert to 0-based index for easier array manipulation\nbutton_A_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_A_positions]\nbutton_B_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_B_positions]\nbutton_C_positions = [(x-1, y-1) for x, y in button_C_positions]\n\n# Define the button sequence for each round\nbutton_sequence = ['B', 'B', 'C']\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x, y] = 1 - grid[x, y]  # Toggle the light\n\n# Simulate each round\nfor button in button_sequence:\n    if button == 'A':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_A_positions)\n    elif button == 'B':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_B_positions)\n    elif button == 'C':\n        toggle_lights(grid, button_C_positions)\n\n# Output the final grid state\ngrid.flatten().tolist()\nassistant > After simulating the button presses according to the given sequence, the final state of the grid is:\n\n\\[ \\text{[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]} \\]\n\nThis represents the grid in a flattened form, where each element corresponds to a light's state (1 for lit, 0 for unlit) in row-major order."
