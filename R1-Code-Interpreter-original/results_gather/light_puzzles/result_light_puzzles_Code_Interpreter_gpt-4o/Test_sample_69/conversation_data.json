    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid. Each button press will toggle the state of the lights it controls. A light that is on (1) will be turned off (0), and a light that is off (0) will be turned on (1).\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n   1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Button B Controls:**\n   - Positions: \\((2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3)\\)\n\n3. **Button A Controls:**\n   - Positions: \\((1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3)\\)\n\n4. **Round 1: Press Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button B.\n\n5. **Round 2: Press Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A.\n\nLet's perform these operations and determine the final state of the grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1]\n])\n\n# Button B controls\nbutton_b_positions = [(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3)]\n\n# Button A controls\nbutton_a_positions = [(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3)]\n\n# Function to toggle lights\ndef toggle_lights(grid, positions):\n    for x, y in positions:\n        grid[x-1, y-1] = 1 - grid[x-1, y-1]  # Toggle the light\n    return grid\n\n# Round 1: Press Button B\ngrid = toggle_lights(grid, button_b_positions)\n\n# Round 2: Press Button A\ngrid = toggle_lights(grid, button_a_positions)\n\n# Flatten the grid to represent the final state\nfinal_state = grid.flatten()\nfinal_state_list = final_state.tolist()\nfinal_state_list\nassistant > After performing the operations for each round, the final state of the grid is represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1>>>} \\]\n\nThis represents the grid in a flattened form, where each number corresponds to the state of a light in the grid, row by row."
