    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid of lights. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. A light that is on (1) will turn off (0), and a light that is off (0) will turn on (1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5, and the initial state is:\n     ```\n     0 1 0 1 0\n     1 1 0 0 1\n     1 0 1 0 0\n     1 0 1 0 1\n     0 1 1 0 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Analysis:**\n   - **Button A** controls: (3,1), (2,1), (2,4), (5,1), (4,5), (3,4), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (4,3), (4,4), (2,5)\n   - **Button B** controls: (1,4), (4,3), (4,4)\n   - **Button C** controls: (2,2), (3,3), (5,3), (1,3), (4,3), (4,5), (2,5), (5,5), (5,4), (1,2)\n\n3. **Round 1: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button C:\n     - (2,2), (3,3), (5,3), (1,3), (4,3), (4,5), (2,5), (5,5), (5,4), (1,2)\n   - New grid state:\n     ```\n     0 0 1 1 0\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 1 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n     - (1,4), (4,3), (4,4)\n   - New grid state:\n     ```\n     0 0 1 0 0\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     1 0 1 1 0\n     0 0 0 1 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button C again:\n     - (2,2), (3,3), (5,3), (1,3), (4,3), (4,5), (2,5), (5,5), (5,4), (1,2)\n   - New grid state:\n     ```\n     0 1 0 0 0\n     1 1 0 0 1\n     1 0 1 0 0\n     1 0 0 1 1\n     0 0 1 0 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button C once more:\n     - (2,2), (3,3), (5,3), (1,3), (4,3), (4,5), (2,5), (5,5), (5,4), (1,2)\n   - Final grid state:\n     ```\n     0 0 1 0 0\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     1 0 1 0 0\n     0 0 0 1 0\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - Convert the final grid state to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     <<<0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0>>>"
