    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Button Control\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"3\"]\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\n\n### Round 1: Button B\nPressing Button B will toggle the lights at its controlled positions:\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"4\", \"4\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"2\", \"4\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"3\", \"1\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"4\", \"2\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"4\", \"3\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"2\", \"2\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"2\", \"1\"] changes from 1 to 0\n\nThe grid after Round 1:\n```\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\nPressing Button A will toggle the lights at its controlled positions:\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"1\", \"2\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"3\", \"2\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"2\", \"2\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"2\", \"4\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"4\", \"3\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] changes from 0 to 1\n\nThe grid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button A\nPressing Button A again will toggle the lights at its controlled positions:\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"1\", \"2\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"3\", \"2\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"2\", \"2\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"2\", \"4\"] changes from 1 to 0\n- [\"4\", \"3\"] changes from 0 to 1\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] changes from 1 to 0\n\nThe grid after Round 3:\n```\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid is:\n```\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of binary values:\n```\n1000001011110010\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0>>>"
