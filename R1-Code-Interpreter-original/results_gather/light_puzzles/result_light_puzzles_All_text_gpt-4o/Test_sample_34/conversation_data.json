    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid of lights. We will go through each round and update the grid according to the lights controlled by the pressed button. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     00100\n     11100\n     00000\n     10101\n     01110\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Mapping:**\n   - Button A controls: (4, 2), (4, 1)\n   - Button B controls: (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 3), (2, 5)\n   - Button C controls: (3, 1), (5, 1), (5, 4)\n\n3. **Round 1: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button C:\n     - (3, 1): 0 -> 1\n     - (5, 1): 0 -> 1\n     - (5, 4): 1 -> 0\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     00100\n     11100\n     10000\n     10101\n     11100\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button C again:\n     - (3, 1): 1 -> 0\n     - (5, 1): 1 -> 0\n     - (5, 4): 0 -> 1\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     00100\n     11100\n     00000\n     10101\n     01110\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button B:\n     - (3, 4): 0 -> 1\n     - (4, 2): 0 -> 1\n     - (5, 3): 1 -> 0\n     - (2, 5): 0 -> 1\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     00100\n     11101\n     00010\n     11101\n     01010\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button B again:\n     - (3, 4): 1 -> 0\n     - (4, 2): 1 -> 0\n     - (5, 3): 0 -> 1\n     - (2, 5): 1 -> 0\n   - Final grid:\n     ```\n     00100\n     11100\n     00000\n     10101\n     01110\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     <<<0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0>>>"
