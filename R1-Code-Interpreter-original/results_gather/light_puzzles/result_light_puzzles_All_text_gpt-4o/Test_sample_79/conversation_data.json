    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 0 0 0\n     0 0 1 0\n     0 1 0 0\n     0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Button A Controls:**\n   - Button A affects the lights at positions [\"2\", \"4\"] and [\"2\", \"1\"].\n   - In matrix terms, these correspond to positions (1, 3) and (1, 0) (considering 0-based indexing).\n\n3. **Button B Controls:**\n   - Button B affects the lights at positions [\"4\", \"3\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"].\n   - In matrix terms, these correspond to positions (3, 2) and (0, 1).\n\n4. **Round 1: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions (1, 3) and (1, 0).\n   - Initial state of row 2: `0 0 1 0`\n   - After toggling (1, 3): `0 0 1 1`\n   - After toggling (1, 0): `1 0 1 1`\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     1 0 0 0\n     1 0 1 1\n     0 1 0 0\n     0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 2: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions (3, 2) and (0, 1).\n   - Initial state of row 4: `0 1 1 1`\n   - After toggling (3, 2): `0 1 0 1`\n   - Initial state of row 1: `1 0 0 0`\n   - After toggling (0, 1): `1 1 0 0`\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     1 1 0 0\n     1 0 1 1\n     0 1 0 0\n     0 1 0 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions (1, 3) and (1, 0) again.\n   - Initial state of row 2: `1 0 1 1`\n   - After toggling (1, 3): `1 0 1 0`\n   - After toggling (1, 0): `0 0 1 0`\n   - Final grid:\n     ```\n     1 1 0 0\n     0 0 1 0\n     0 1 0 0\n     0 1 0 1\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     <<<1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1>>>"
