  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=3 and the number of buttons=2, the initial network is:\n111\n101\n011\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"3\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"3\"]\n\nRound 1: Button B\nRound 2: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing each button on the grid of lights. We will go through each round and update the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n### Button Control\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"3\"].\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"3\"].\n\n### Round 1: Press Button B\nButton B affects the following positions:\n- [\"2\", \"1\"] (second row, first column)\n- [\"2\", \"2\"] (second row, second column)\n- [\"3\", \"2\"] (third row, second column)\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] (first row, third column)\n\nToggle the lights at these positions:\n- [\"2\", \"1\"]: 1 becomes 0\n- [\"2\", \"2\"]: 0 becomes 1\n- [\"3\", \"2\"]: 1 becomes 0\n- [\"1\", \"3\"]: 1 becomes 0\n\nThe grid after pressing Button B:\n```\n1 1 0\n0 1 1\n0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Press Button A\nButton A affects the following positions:\n- [\"1\", \"1\"] (first row, first column)\n- [\"2\", \"1\"] (second row, first column)\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] (first row, third column)\n\nToggle the lights at these positions:\n- [\"1\", \"1\"]: 1 becomes 0\n- [\"2\", \"1\"]: 0 becomes 1\n- [\"1\", \"3\"]: 0 becomes 1\n\nThe grid after pressing Button A:\n```\n0 1 1\n1 1 1\n0 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Grid\nThe final grid after all rounds of operation is:\n```\n0 1 1\n1 1 1\n0 0 1\n```\n\n### Result in the Required Format\nConvert the final grid to the required format (a single line of numbers):\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1>>>"
