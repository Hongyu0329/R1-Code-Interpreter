    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A three times on the initial grid. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Button A Controls\nButton A controls the following positions:\n- [\"4\", \"2\"] -> (3, 1)\n- [\"1\", \"2\"] -> (0, 1)\n- [\"3\", \"2\"] -> (2, 1)\n- [\"3\", \"3\"] -> (2, 2)\n- [\"1\", \"1\"] -> (0, 0)\n- [\"3\", \"1\"] -> (2, 0)\n\n### Round 1: Press Button A\nToggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A:\n- (3, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (0, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 2): 0 -> 1\n- (0, 0): 1 -> 0\n- (2, 0): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Press Button A\nToggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A again:\n- (3, 1): 1 -> 0\n- (0, 1): 1 -> 0\n- (2, 1): 1 -> 0\n- (2, 2): 1 -> 0\n- (0, 0): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 0): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Press Button A\nToggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A once more:\n- (3, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (0, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 2): 0 -> 1\n- (0, 0): 1 -> 0\n- (2, 0): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid after all rounds of operation is:\n```\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of 0s and 1s:\n```\n0111010101110111\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n<<<0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1>>>\n```"
