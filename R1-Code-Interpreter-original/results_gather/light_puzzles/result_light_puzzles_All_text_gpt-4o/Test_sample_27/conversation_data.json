    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the pressing of buttons on the grid and observe how the lights change state. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     00110\n     10000\n     11010\n     11101\n     10100\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Mapping:**\n   - **Button A** controls: (3,2), (3,5), (1,3), (2,5), (4,5)\n   - **Button B** controls: (2,3), (2,1), (4,4), (1,3), (1,5), (5,5), (3,1)\n   - **Button C** controls: (3,3), (1,3), (3,4), (4,1), (3,5)\n\n3. **Round 1: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button A:\n     - (3,2): 1 -> 0\n     - (3,5): 0 -> 1\n     - (1,3): 1 -> 0\n     - (2,5): 0 -> 1\n     - (4,5): 1 -> 0\n   - New grid:\n     ```\n     00010\n     10001\n     10011\n     11100\n     10100\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button C:\n     - (3,3): 0 -> 1\n     - (1,3): 0 -> 1\n     - (3,4): 1 -> 0\n     - (4,1): 1 -> 0\n     - (3,5): 1 -> 0\n   - New grid:\n     ```\n     00110\n     10001\n     10100\n     01100\n     10100\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button C again:\n     - (3,3): 1 -> 0\n     - (1,3): 1 -> 0\n     - (3,4): 0 -> 1\n     - (4,1): 0 -> 1\n     - (3,5): 0 -> 1\n   - New grid:\n     ```\n     00010\n     10001\n     10011\n     11100\n     10100\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button A again:\n     - (3,2): 0 -> 1\n     - (3,5): 1 -> 0\n     - (1,3): 0 -> 1\n     - (2,5): 1 -> 0\n     - (4,5): 0 -> 1\n   - Final grid:\n     ```\n     00110\n     10000\n     11010\n     11101\n     10100\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     <<<0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0>>>"
