There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing each button on the grid of lights. Each button toggles the state of specific lights, changing a 1 to a 0 and vice versa. We will apply the button presses in the given order and track the changes to the grid.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (1,1), (2,4), (3,2), (4,3), (1,2), (4,2), (2,2)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (1,3), (4,2), (1,2), (3,2), (4,3), (2,2), (3,3)\n\n### Round 1: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (1,3): 0 -> 1\n- (4,2): 1 -> 0\n- (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- (3,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (2,2): 0 -> 1\n- (3,3): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A:\n- (1,1): 1 -> 0\n- (2,4): 1 -> 0\n- (3,2): 1 -> 0\n- (4,3): 0 -> 1\n- (1,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,2): 0 -> 1\n- (2,2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (1,3): 1 -> 0\n- (4,2): 1 -> 0\n- (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- (3,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (2,2): 0 -> 1\n- (3,3): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid, represented as a single line of 0s and 1s, is:\n```\n0001011011001001\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<0001011011001001>>>"
