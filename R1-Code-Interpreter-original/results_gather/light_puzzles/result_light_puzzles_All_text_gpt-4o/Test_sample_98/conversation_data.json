    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid of lights. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. A light that is on (1) will be turned off (0), and a light that is off (0) will be turned on (1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid State:**\n   ```\n   0001\n   0010\n   1111\n   1010\n   ```\n\n2. **Button A Controls:**\n   - [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"3\"]\n\n3. **Button B Controls:**\n   - [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"4\"]\n\n4. **Button C Controls:**\n   - [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"4\"]\n\n5. **Round 1: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n     - [\"1\", \"4\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"3\", \"2\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"4\", \"1\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"2\", \"2\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"3\", \"3\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"1\", \"2\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"3\", \"4\"] (1 -> 0)\n\n   Updated Grid:\n   ```\n   0111\n   0110\n   1000\n   0010\n   ```\n\n6. **Round 2: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button B again:\n     - [\"1\", \"4\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"3\", \"2\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"4\", \"1\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"2\", \"2\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"3\", \"3\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"1\", \"2\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"3\", \"4\"] (0 -> 1)\n\n   Updated Grid:\n   ```\n   0010\n   0010\n   1111\n   1010\n   ```\n\n7. **Round 3: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button C:\n     - [\"3\", \"2\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"4\", \"4\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"3\", \"1\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"1\", \"3\"] (1 -> 0)\n     - [\"1\", \"1\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"2\", \"1\"] (0 -> 1)\n     - [\"3\", \"4\"] (1 -> 0)\n\n   Final Grid:\n   ```\n   1010\n   1010\n   0000\n   1011\n   ```\n\n8. **Convert the Final Grid to a Single String:**\n   - Concatenate the rows of the final grid to form a single string:\n   ```\n   1010101000001011\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final result after all rounds of operation is: <<<1010101000001011>>>"
