  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=4 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n0110\n1111\n0010\n0000\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"4\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"3\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\nRound 2: Button B\nRound 3: Button B\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and update the grid accordingly. We will go through each round step by step.\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Button A Controls:\n- [\"3\", \"3\"] -> (2, 2)\n- [\"3\", \"4\"] -> (2, 3)\n- [\"4\", \"2\"] -> (3, 1)\n- [\"3\", \"2\"] -> (2, 1)\n- [\"1\", \"4\"] -> (0, 3)\n\n### Button B Controls:\n- [\"1\", \"4\"] -> (0, 3)\n- [\"4\", \"1\"] -> (3, 0)\n- [\"2\", \"2\"] -> (1, 1)\n- [\"2\", \"1\"] -> (1, 0)\n\n### Button C Controls:\n- [\"4\", \"1\"] -> (3, 0)\n- [\"4\", \"3\"] -> (3, 2)\n- [\"1\", \"1\"] -> (0, 0)\n- [\"2\", \"1\"] -> (1, 0)\n- [\"1\", \"2\"] -> (0, 1)\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] -> (0, 2)\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] -> (1, 2)\n\n### Round 1: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A:\n- (2, 2): 1 -> 0\n- (2, 3): 0 -> 1\n- (3, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (0, 3): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (0, 3): 1 -> 0\n- (3, 0): 0 -> 1\n- (1, 1): 1 -> 0\n- (1, 0): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B again:\n- (0, 3): 0 -> 1\n- (3, 0): 1 -> 0\n- (1, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (1, 0): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Result:\nThe final grid is:\n```\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of numbers:\n`0111111101010100`\n\nFinal Answer: `0111111101010100`"
