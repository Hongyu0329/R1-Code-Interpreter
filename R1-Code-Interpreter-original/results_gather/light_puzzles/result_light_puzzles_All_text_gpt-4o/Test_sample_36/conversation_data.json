    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button in sequence on the initial grid. Each button press will toggle the state of the lights it controls (i.e., change 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls: (4, 3), (5, 5)\n- **Button B** controls: (1, 4), (5, 4), (2, 4), (2, 1), (4, 4)\n- **Button C** controls: (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (1, 5), (2, 3), (1, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (2, 5), (2, 1)\n\n### Round 1: Button A\nToggle the lights at (4, 3) and (5, 5):\n- (4, 3): 0 -> 1\n- (5, 5): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\nToggle the lights at (4, 3) and (5, 5) again:\n- (4, 3): 1 -> 0\n- (5, 5): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button B\nToggle the lights at (1, 4), (5, 4), (2, 4), (2, 1), (4, 4):\n- (1, 4): 0 -> 1\n- (5, 4): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 4): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 1): 1 -> 0\n- (4, 4): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button C\nToggle the lights at (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (1, 5), (2, 3), (1, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (2, 5), (2, 1):\n- (3, 2): 0 -> 1\n- (5, 2): 0 -> 1\n- (5, 1): 0 -> 1\n- (1, 5): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 3): 1 -> 0\n- (1, 3): 1 -> 0\n- (5, 3): 0 -> 1\n- (4, 3): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 5): 1 -> 0\n- (2, 1): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid is:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of numbers:\n`0101100100110100111111111`\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n`<<<0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1>>>`"
