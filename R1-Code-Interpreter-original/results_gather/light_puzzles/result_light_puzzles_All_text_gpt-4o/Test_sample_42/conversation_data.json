    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button in sequence on the grid of lights. Each button toggles the state of specific lights, changing a 1 to a 0 and vice versa. We will go through each round, apply the button's effect, and update the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Button Effects\n- **Button A** toggles the lights at positions: (4,5), (3,1), (2,1), (1,5), (5,2), (1,1), (5,5)\n- **Button B** toggles the lights at positions: (1,4), (2,2), (1,2), (2,3), (4,2), (3,3), (3,2), (4,1), (3,1), (5,1), (4,5), (5,5)\n- **Button C** toggles the lights at positions: (4,3), (2,5), (4,1), (1,2), (2,4), (3,1)\n\n### Round 1: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (1,4), (2,2), (1,2), (2,3), (4,2), (3,3), (3,2), (4,1), (3,1), (5,1), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nUpdated grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A:\n- (4,5), (3,1), (2,1), (1,5), (5,2), (1,1), (5,5)\n\nUpdated grid:\n```\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button C\nToggle the lights controlled by Button C:\n- (4,3), (2,5), (4,1), (1,2), (2,4), (3,1)\n\nUpdated grid:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (1,4), (2,2), (1,2), (2,3), (4,2), (3,3), (3,2), (4,1), (3,1), (5,1), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFinal grid:\n```\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final grid, represented as a single line of numbers, is:\n```\n<<<1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0>>>\n```"
