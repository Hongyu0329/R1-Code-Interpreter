  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=4 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n1010\n1110\n0100\n1110\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"2\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"2\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\nRound 2: Button A\nRound 3: Button C\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. The grid is a 4x4 matrix, and each button press toggles the state of specific lights (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls:\n- **Button A** toggles the lights at positions: (1,4), (1,1), (2,2), (1,3), (4,2)\n- **Button B** toggles the lights at positions: (4,4), (1,1), (3,2), (4,3), (1,4), (4,2)\n- **Button C** toggles the lights at positions: (1,4), (2,1), (1,3), (2,4), (4,3), (4,1)\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Round 1: Button A\n- Toggle (1,4): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1,1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2,2): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1,3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (4,2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\n#### Round 2: Button A\n- Toggle (1,4): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1,1): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2,2): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1,3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (4,2): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### Round 3: Button C\n- Toggle (1,4): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2,1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1,3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2,4): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (4,1): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Grid Representation:\nThe final grid can be represented as a single list of 16 elements (4x4 grid):\n```\n1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0>>>"
