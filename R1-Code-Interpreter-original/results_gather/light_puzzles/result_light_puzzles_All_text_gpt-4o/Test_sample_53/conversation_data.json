  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n00\n00\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"2\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A on the initial grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 2x2 matrix, represented as:\n     ```\n     00\n     00\n     ```\n   - This means all lights are initially unlit.\n\n2. **Button A's Control:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"2\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"].\n   - In a 2x2 grid, the positions can be visualized as:\n     ```\n     (1,1) (1,2)\n     (2,1) (2,2)\n     ```\n   - Therefore, Button A affects the lights at positions (1,2) and (2,2).\n\n3. **Effect of Pressing Button A:**\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the state of the lights at the specified positions.\n   - Initially, all lights are 0 (unlit).\n   - Toggling a light changes its state from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.\n\n4. **Apply Button A's Effect:**\n   - Toggle the light at position (1,2): It changes from 0 to 1.\n   - Toggle the light at position (2,2): It changes from 0 to 1.\n\n5. **Resulting Grid:**\n   - After pressing Button A, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     01\n     01\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as <<<0,1,0,1>>>.\n\nTherefore, the result after all rounds of operation is: <<<0,1,0,1>>>."
