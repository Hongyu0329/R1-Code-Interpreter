    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the sequence of button presses to determine the final state of the grid. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid State:**\n   ```\n   10000\n   11011\n   00011\n   11100\n   10100\n   ```\n\n2. **Button Control Analysis:**\n   - **Button A** controls: (2,4), (4,2), (2,3), (3,5), (4,4), (1,3), (1,1), (4,3), (3,1), (5,4), (4,1)\n   - **Button B** controls: (1,2), (3,5), (4,2), (5,3), (3,4), (3,1), (3,3)\n   - **Button C** controls: (5,5), (5,1), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,3), (3,4), (5,2), (1,5), (1,1), (3,5)\n\n3. **Round 1: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C.\n   - Positions: (5,5), (5,1), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,3), (3,4), (5,2), (1,5), (1,1), (3,5)\n   - New Grid:\n     ```\n     00001\n     11111\n     10001\n     00110\n     00110\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A.\n   - Positions: (2,4), (4,2), (2,3), (3,5), (4,4), (1,3), (1,1), (4,3), (3,1), (5,4), (4,1)\n   - New Grid:\n     ```\n     01001\n     11001\n     00000\n     11101\n     00000\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C.\n   - Positions: (5,5), (5,1), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,3), (3,4), (5,2), (1,5), (1,1), (3,5)\n   - New Grid:\n     ```\n     10000\n     11111\n     11011\n     00011\n     11110\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C.\n   - Positions: (5,5), (5,1), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,3), (3,4), (5,2), (1,5), (1,1), (3,5)\n   - Final Grid:\n     ```\n     00001\n     11001\n     10001\n     00110\n     00110\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n   - <<<0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0>>>\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0>>>"
