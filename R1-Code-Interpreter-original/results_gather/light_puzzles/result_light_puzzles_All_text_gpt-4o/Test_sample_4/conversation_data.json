    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n0 1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (4,5), (1,3), (5,2), (4,1), (2,4), (2,2), (4,2), (2,1), (4,3), (3,1)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (1,2), (4,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (5,1), (3,5), (2,5)\n- **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (2,5), (2,2), (4,5)\n\n### Round 1: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- (4,2): 1 -> 0\n- (3,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,2): 0 -> 1\n- (3,3): 0 -> 1\n- (4,1): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,5): 0 -> 1\n- (2,5): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B again:\n- (1,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,2): 0 -> 1\n- (3,1): 1 -> 0\n- (3,2): 1 -> 0\n- (3,3): 1 -> 0\n- (4,1): 0 -> 1\n- (5,1): 1 -> 0\n- (3,5): 1 -> 0\n- (2,5): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B again:\n- (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- (4,2): 1 -> 0\n- (3,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,2): 0 -> 1\n- (3,3): 0 -> 1\n- (4,1): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,5): 0 -> 1\n- (2,5): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button C\nToggle the lights controlled by Button C:\n- (2,5): 0 -> 1\n- (2,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,5): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid, represented as a single line of numbers, is:\n```\n0011010011111011010010100\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0>>>"
