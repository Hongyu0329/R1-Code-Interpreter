    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing each button on the grid and update the grid accordingly. We will go through each round step by step.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n0 1 1\n0 0 1\n1 0 1\n```\n\n### Button A Controls\nButton A affects the following positions:\n- [\"3\", \"3\"] -> (2, 2) in 0-indexed\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] -> (1, 2) in 0-indexed\n- [\"1\", \"1\"] -> (0, 0) in 0-indexed\n- [\"3\", \"1\"] -> (2, 0) in 0-indexed\n\n### Button B Controls\nButton B affects the following positions:\n- [\"1\", \"2\"] -> (0, 1) in 0-indexed\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] -> (1, 2) in 0-indexed\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] -> (0, 2) in 0-indexed\n- [\"2\", \"2\"] -> (1, 1) in 0-indexed\n\n### Round 1: Press Button B\nWe toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button B:\n- (0, 1): 1 -> 0\n- (1, 2): 1 -> 0\n- (0, 2): 1 -> 0\n- (1, 1): 0 -> 1\n\nThe grid after pressing Button B:\n```\n0 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Press Button A\nWe toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A:\n- (2, 2): 1 -> 0\n- (1, 2): 0 -> 1\n- (0, 0): 0 -> 1\n- (2, 0): 1 -> 0\n\nThe grid after pressing Button A:\n```\n1 0 0\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid is:\n```\n1 0 0\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single sequence of numbers:\n<<<1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0>>>"
