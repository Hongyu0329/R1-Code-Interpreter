    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid of lights. We will go through each round and update the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"3\"].\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"3\"].\n\n### Round 1: Press Button B\nButton B affects the following positions:\n- [\"1\", \"1\"] (first row, first column)\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] (second row, third column)\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] (first row, third column)\n\nWe toggle the lights at these positions:\n1. [\"1\", \"1\"]: The current state is 1, so it toggles to 0.\n2. [\"2\", \"3\"]: The current state is 1, so it toggles to 0.\n3. [\"1\", \"3\"]: The current state is 0, so it toggles to 1.\n\nThe grid after Round 1:\n```\n0 1 1\n1 1 0\n0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Press Button B Again\nButton B affects the same positions as before:\n- [\"1\", \"1\"] (first row, first column)\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] (second row, third column)\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] (first row, third column)\n\nWe toggle the lights at these positions again:\n1. [\"1\", \"1\"]: The current state is 0, so it toggles to 1.\n2. [\"2\", \"3\"]: The current state is 0, so it toggles to 1.\n3. [\"1\", \"3\"]: The current state is 1, so it toggles to 0.\n\nThe grid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nAfter all rounds, the grid is:\n```\n1 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 1\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single sequence of numbers:\n```\n<<<1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1>>>\n```\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1>>>"
