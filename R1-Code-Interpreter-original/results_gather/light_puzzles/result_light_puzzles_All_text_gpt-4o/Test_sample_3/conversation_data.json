    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the pressing of buttons on the grid and observe how the lights change state. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls (from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1). Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls: [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"4\"]\n- **Button B** controls: [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"4\"]\n- **Button C** controls: [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"5\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"5\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"5\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"4\"]\n\n### Round 1: Button A\n- Toggle [\"1\", \"3\"]: (1,3) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"2\", \"4\"]: (2,4) changes from 1 to 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\n- Toggle [\"1\", \"3\"]: (1,3) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"2\", \"4\"]: (2,4) changes from 0 to 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button C\n- Toggle [\"1\", \"4\"]: (1,4) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"4\"]: (4,4) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"5\"]: (3,5) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"2\", \"2\"]: (2,2) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"5\", \"2\"]: (5,2) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"5\"]: (4,5) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"2\"]: (3,2) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"1\"]: (3,1) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"5\", \"1\"]: (5,1) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"4\"]: (3,4) changes from 0 to 1\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button C\n- Toggle [\"1\", \"4\"]: (1,4) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"4\"]: (4,4) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"5\"]: (3,5) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"2\", \"2\"]: (2,2) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"5\", \"2\"]: (5,2) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"5\"]: (4,5) changes from 0 to 1\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"2\"]: (3,2) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"1\"]: (3,1) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"5\", \"1\"]: (5,1) changes from 1 to 0\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"4\"]: (3,4) changes from 1 to 0\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid is:\n```\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of 0s and 1s:\n```\n<<<1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0>>>\n```\n\nFinal Answer: <<<1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0>>>"
