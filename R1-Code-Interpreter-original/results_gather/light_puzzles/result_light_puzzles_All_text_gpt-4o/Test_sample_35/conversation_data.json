    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls: (4,4), (5,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,1), (5,2)\n- **Button B** controls: (3,5), (5,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n- **Button C** controls: (2,1), (2,5), (4,2), (1,5), (3,4), (5,5), (5,2)\n\n### Round 1: Button A\nPressing Button A toggles the state of the lights it controls:\n- (4,4): 0 -> 1\n- (5,3): 0 -> 1\n- (2,3): 1 -> 0\n- (2,4): 1 -> 0\n- (2,1): 0 -> 1\n- (5,2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\nPressing Button A again toggles the same lights:\n- (4,4): 1 -> 0\n- (5,3): 1 -> 0\n- (2,3): 0 -> 1\n- (2,4): 0 -> 1\n- (2,1): 1 -> 0\n- (5,2): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button B\nPressing Button B toggles the lights it controls:\n- (3,5): 1 -> 0\n- (5,4): 0 -> 1\n- (3,4): 0 -> 1\n- (4,4): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button C\nPressing Button C toggles the lights it controls:\n- (2,1): 0 -> 1\n- (2,5): 0 -> 1\n- (4,2): 0 -> 1\n- (1,5): 0 -> 1\n- (3,4): 1 -> 0\n- (5,5): 0 -> 1\n- (5,2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid, represented as a single line of numbers, is:\n```\n<<<1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1>>>\n```\n\nThis is the result after all rounds of operation."
