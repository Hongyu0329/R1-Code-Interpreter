    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 0 0 0\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 0 1 0\n     0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Mapping:**\n   - **Button A** controls the lights at positions:\n     - (3, 4)\n     - (2, 3)\n   - **Button B** controls the lights at positions:\n     - (2, 1)\n     - (3, 1)\n     - (1, 4)\n     - (1, 2)\n     - (3, 2)\n\n3. **Round 1: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n     - (2, 1): Change from 1 to 0\n     - (3, 1): Change from 0 to 1\n     - (1, 4): Change from 0 to 1\n     - (1, 2): Change from 0 to 1\n     - (3, 2): Change from 0 to 1\n   - Resulting grid:\n     ```\n     1 1 0 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     1 1 1 0\n     0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button A:\n     - (3, 4): Change from 0 to 1\n     - (2, 3): Change from 0 to 1\n   - Resulting grid:\n     ```\n     1 1 0 1\n     0 0 1 1\n     1 1 1 1\n     0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights controlled by Button A again:\n     - (3, 4): Change from 1 to 0\n     - (2, 3): Change from 1 to 0\n   - Resulting grid:\n     ```\n     1 1 0 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     1 1 1 0\n     0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Grid Representation:**\n   - Convert the grid to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, representing the grid after all rounds of operation, is:\n<<<1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0>>>"
