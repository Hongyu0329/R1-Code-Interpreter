  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n11\n10\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"2\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A on the initial grid configuration. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Grid Configuration:**\n   - The grid is a 2x2 matrix.\n   - The initial state of the grid is:\n     ```\n     1 1\n     1 0\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as:\n     ```\n     Row 1: [1, 1]\n     Row 2: [1, 0]\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Lights Controlled by Button A:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"2\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"].\n   - In a 2x2 grid, these positions correspond to:\n     - [\"2\", \"2\"] is the light in the second row, second column.\n     - [\"1\", \"2\"] is the light in the first row, second column.\n\n3. **Determine the Effect of Pressing Button A:**\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the state of the lights it controls.\n   - Toggling means changing a 1 to a 0, or a 0 to a 1.\n\n4. **Apply the Toggle Operation:**\n   - For position [\"2\", \"2\"] (second row, second column), the initial state is 0. Toggling it changes it to 1.\n   - For position [\"1\", \"2\"] (first row, second column), the initial state is 1. Toggling it changes it to 0.\n\n5. **Update the Grid:**\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     Row 1: [1, 0]\n     Row 2: [1, 1]\n     ```\n\n6. **Represent the Final Grid State:**\n   - The final grid state can be represented as a single sequence of numbers, reading row by row:\n     - Row 1: 1, 0\n     - Row 2: 1, 1\n   - Therefore, the final representation is <<<1,0,1,1>>>.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1,0,1,1>>>"
