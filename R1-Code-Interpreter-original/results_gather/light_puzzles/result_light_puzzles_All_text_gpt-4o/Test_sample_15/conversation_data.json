    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button on the grid of lights. Each button press toggles the state of specific lights (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). We will go through each round and apply the changes to the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** toggles lights at positions: (5, 2), (4, 4)\n- **Button B** toggles lights at positions: (1, 3), (2, 1), (1, 4)\n- **Button C** toggles lights at positions: (5, 2), (4, 3), (1, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 5)\n\n### Round-by-Round Analysis\n\n#### Round 1: Button B\n- Toggle (1, 3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1, 4): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Round 2: Button B\n- Toggle (1, 3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 1): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1, 4): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Round 3: Button C\n- Toggle (5, 2): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (4, 3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1, 3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1, 1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (3, 5): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (3, 4): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (4, 2): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (3, 2): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (3, 1): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 5): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Round 4: Button A\n- Toggle (5, 2): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (4, 4): 1 -> 0\n\nFinal Grid after Round 4:\n```\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final grid, represented as a single line of 0s and 1s, is:\n```\n0110100110100111010011011\n```"
