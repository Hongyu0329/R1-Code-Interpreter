    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step according to the rounds specified. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n00111\n11001\n01111\n10001\n01001\n```\n\n### Button Control Details\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (2,4), (1,3), (4,2), (2,1), (4,3), (5,1), (2,3)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (1,2), (3,4), (2,1), (1,3), (2,4)\n- **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (4,3), (3,4), (1,3), (4,4), (2,1)\n\n### Rounds of Operation\n1. **Round 1: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions: (4,3), (3,4), (1,3), (4,4), (2,1)\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     00011\n     01001\n     01101\n     10111\n     01001\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 2: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions: (4,3), (3,4), (1,3), (4,4), (2,1)\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     00111\n     11001\n     01111\n     10001\n     01001\n     ```\n\n3. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions: (2,4), (1,3), (4,2), (2,1), (4,3), (5,1), (2,3)\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     00011\n     00101\n     01111\n     11101\n     11001\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 4: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions: (4,3), (3,4), (1,3), (4,4), (2,1)\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     00111\n     10101\n     01101\n     11011\n     11001\n     ```\n\n### Final Grid\nAfter all rounds, the final grid is:\n```\n00111\n10101\n01101\n11011\n11001\n```\n\n### Result Representation\nThe final grid can be represented as a single line of binary numbers:\n```\n0011110101011011101111001\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n<<<0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1>>>\n```"
