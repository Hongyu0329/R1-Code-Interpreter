    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the sequence of button presses to determine the final state of the grid. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     0 1 1 1 0\n     1 0 1 0 0\n     1 1 0 1 1\n     0 1 0 1 1\n     0 0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Analysis:**\n   - **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (2,1), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (5,1), (1,3), (3,4).\n   - **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (5,2), (5,3), (3,5), (1,2), (4,5), (2,1), (1,1), (3,2), (2,3), (5,1).\n   - **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (3,4), (1,4), (2,2), (4,4), (1,2), (2,5), (2,4), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,5), (3,5).\n\n3. **Round 1: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0 0 1 0 1\n     0 1 1 1 1\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     1 1 0 0 1\n     0 0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 0 1\n     1 1 1 1 1\n     0 0 0 1 1\n     1 1 0 1 0\n     1 0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A again.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0 0 1 0 1\n     0 1 1 1 1\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     0 1 0 0 1\n     0 0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C again.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0 1 1 1 0\n     1 0 1 0 0\n     1 1 0 1 1\n     0 0 0 1 0\n     0 0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Grid Representation:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1>>>"
