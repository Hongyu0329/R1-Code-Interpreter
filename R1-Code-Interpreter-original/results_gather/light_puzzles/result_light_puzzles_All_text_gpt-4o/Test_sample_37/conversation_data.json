    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     01101\n     10000\n     11100\n     01011\n     10010\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Details:**\n   - **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (4,3), (5,4), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (3,5), (3,4), (1,3).\n   - **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (3,1), (5,4).\n   - **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (1,1), (5,4), (4,1).\n\n3. **Round 1: Button A Pressed**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A:\n     - (4,3): 1 -> 0\n     - (5,4): 1 -> 0\n     - (2,5): 0 -> 1\n     - (2,4): 0 -> 1\n     - (1,4): 0 -> 1\n     - (3,5): 0 -> 1\n     - (3,4): 0 -> 1\n     - (1,3): 1 -> 0\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     01011\n     10110\n     11111\n     00011\n     10000\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button A Pressed Again**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A again:\n     - (4,3): 0 -> 1\n     - (5,4): 0 -> 1\n     - (2,5): 1 -> 0\n     - (2,4): 1 -> 0\n     - (1,4): 1 -> 0\n     - (3,5): 1 -> 0\n     - (3,4): 1 -> 0\n     - (1,3): 0 -> 1\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     01101\n     10000\n     11100\n     01011\n     10010\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button C Pressed**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C:\n     - (1,1): 0 -> 1\n     - (5,4): 1 -> 0\n     - (4,1): 0 -> 1\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     11101\n     10000\n     11100\n     11011\n     10000\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button C Pressed Again**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C again:\n     - (1,1): 1 -> 0\n     - (5,4): 0 -> 1\n     - (4,1): 1 -> 0\n   - Final grid:\n     ```\n     01101\n     10000\n     11100\n     01011\n     10010\n     ```\n\nThe final result after all rounds of operation is:\n```\n01101\n10000\n11100\n01011\n10010\n```"
