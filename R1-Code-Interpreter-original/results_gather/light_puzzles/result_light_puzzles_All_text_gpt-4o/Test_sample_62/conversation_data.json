  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n10\n00\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A on the initial grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 2x2 matrix.\n   - The initial state of the grid is:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     0 0\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as:\n     ```\n     Row 1: [1, 0]\n     Row 2: [0, 0]\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Lights Controlled by Button A:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"2\"] and [\"2\", \"1\"].\n   - In a 2x2 grid, these positions correspond to:\n     - [\"2\", \"2\"] is the light in the second row, second column.\n     - [\"2\", \"1\"] is the light in the second row, first column.\n\n3. **Determine the Effect of Pressing Button A:**\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the state of the lights it controls.\n   - Toggling means changing a light from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.\n\n4. **Apply the Effect of Button A to the Grid:**\n   - Initial state of the grid:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     0 0\n     ```\n   - After pressing Button A:\n     - The light at [\"2\", \"2\"] changes from 0 to 1.\n     - The light at [\"2\", \"1\"] changes from 0 to 1.\n   - The new state of the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     1 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Represent the Final Grid State:**\n   - The final state of the grid is:\n     ```\n     Row 1: [1, 0]\n     Row 2: [1, 1]\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a single sequence: <<<1,0,1,1>>>\n\nTherefore, the result after all rounds of operation is: <<<1,0,1,1>>>"
