    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step according to the rounds specified. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n00101\n01101\n00110\n10101\n00001\n```\nThis can be represented as a 5x5 matrix:\n```\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Button Effects\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (4,4), (1,4), (4,3), (5,4), (5,1), (1,5)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (3,3), (5,2), (2,3), (4,2), (4,5), (5,1), (5,4), (3,2), (2,5), (3,5), (3,1), (2,1)\n- **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (4,4), (1,3), (5,1), (3,3), (2,1), (3,5)\n\n### Round-by-Round Analysis\n\n#### Round 1: Button A\nToggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A:\n- (4,4): 0 -> 1\n- (1,4): 0 -> 1\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (5,4): 0 -> 1\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (1,5): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n```\n\n#### Round 2: Button C\nToggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C:\n- (4,4): 1 -> 0\n- (1,3): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 1 -> 0\n- (3,3): 1 -> 0\n- (2,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,5): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n```\n\n#### Round 3: Button C\nToggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C again:\n- (4,4): 0 -> 1\n- (1,3): 0 -> 1\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,3): 0 -> 1\n- (2,1): 1 -> 0\n- (3,5): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n```\n\n#### Round 4: Button A\nToggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A again:\n- (4,4): 1 -> 0\n- (1,4): 1 -> 0\n- (4,3): 0 -> 1\n- (5,4): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 1 -> 0\n- (1,5): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid after all rounds is:\n```\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\nRepresenting this as a single line of binary values:\n```\n0010111010011101010000001\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1>>>"
