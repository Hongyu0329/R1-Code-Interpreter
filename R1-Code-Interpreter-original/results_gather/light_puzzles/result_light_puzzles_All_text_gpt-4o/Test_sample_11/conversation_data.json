    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid of lights. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. A light that is on (1) will turn off (0), and a light that is off (0) will turn on (1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   10111\n   01001\n   01100\n   10110\n   11101\n   ```\n\n2. **Button Control Mapping:**\n   - **Button A**: [\"3\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"5\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"5\"]\n   - **Button B**: [\"5\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"5\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"5\"], [\"3\", \"5\"]\n   - **Button C**: [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"5\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"5\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"5\"]\n\n3. **Round 1: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     00111\n     10111\n     00111\n     00110\n     10100\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C again.\n   - After toggling, the grid returns to its state before Round 1:\n     ```\n     10111\n     01001\n     01100\n     10110\n     11101\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     00101\n     00010\n     01011\n     11100\n     11101\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button B.\n   - After toggling, the final grid becomes:\n     ```\n     10101\n     00110\n     01001\n     11101\n     01111\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - Convert the final grid into a single list of 0s and 1s:\n     ```\n     <<<1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1>>>"
