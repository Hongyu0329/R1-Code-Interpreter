    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button B on the grid of lights. We will go through each round step by step and update the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Button B Controls:\nButton B affects the following positions:\n- [\"2\", \"1\"] -> (1, 0)\n- [\"2\", \"3\"] -> (1, 2)\n- [\"3\", \"1\"] -> (2, 0)\n- [\"3\", \"4\"] -> (2, 3)\n- [\"2\", \"4\"] -> (1, 3)\n- [\"3\", \"3\"] -> (2, 2)\n- [\"3\", \"2\"] -> (2, 1)\n- [\"4\", \"3\"] -> (3, 2)\n\n### Round 1: Press Button B\n- Toggle (1, 0): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1, 2): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 0): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1, 3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 2): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (3, 2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Press Button B\n- Toggle (1, 0): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1, 2): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 0): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1, 3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 2): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 1): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (3, 2): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Press Button B\n- Toggle (1, 0): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1, 2): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 0): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1, 3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 2): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (3, 2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Result:\nThe final grid after all rounds of operation is:\n```\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of binary values:\n```\n0010000110101001\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1>>>"
