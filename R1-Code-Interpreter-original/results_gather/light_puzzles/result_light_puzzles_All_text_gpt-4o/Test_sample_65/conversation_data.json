  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=3 and the number of buttons=2, the initial network is:\n100\n001\n010\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"3\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button B\nRound 2: Button B\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid of lights. We will go through each round and update the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (1,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (1,1), (3,1)\n\n### Round 1: Button B\nPressing Button B will toggle the lights at positions (1,1) and (3,1).\n\n1. **Toggle (1,1):** The light at (1,1) changes from 1 to 0.\n2. **Toggle (3,1):** The light at (3,1) changes from 0 to 1.\n\nThe grid after Round 1:\n```\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button B\nPressing Button B again will toggle the lights at positions (1,1) and (3,1) once more.\n\n1. **Toggle (1,1):** The light at (1,1) changes from 0 to 1.\n2. **Toggle (3,1):** The light at (3,1) changes from 1 to 0.\n\nThe grid after Round 2:\n```\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n```\n\n### Final Grid\nAfter all rounds, the final grid is:\n```\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n```\n\n### Result Representation\nThe final grid can be represented as a single sequence of lights:\n```\n<<<1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0>>>\n```\n\nTherefore, the result after all rounds of operation is:\n<<<1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0>>>"
