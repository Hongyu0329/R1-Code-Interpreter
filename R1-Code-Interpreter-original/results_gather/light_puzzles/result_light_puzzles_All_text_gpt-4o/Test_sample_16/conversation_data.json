  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step according to the rounds specified. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls: (4,4), (5,5), (4,5), (1,1), (4,3), (5,2), (1,4), (5,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n- **Button B** controls: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n- **Button C** controls: (5,2), (5,1), (1,1), (2,1)\n\n### Round 1: Button B\nButton B toggles the lights at positions:\n- (2,4): 0 -> 1\n- (3,4): 0 -> 1\n- (3,3): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\nButton A toggles the lights at positions:\n- (4,4): 0 -> 1\n- (5,5): 0 -> 1\n- (4,5): 0 -> 1\n- (1,1): 1 -> 0\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (5,2): 0 -> 1\n- (1,4): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (1,2): 0 -> 1\n- (1,3): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button B\nButton B toggles the lights at positions:\n- (2,4): 1 -> 0\n- (3,4): 1 -> 0\n- (3,3): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button B\nButton B toggles the lights at positions:\n- (2,4): 0 -> 1\n- (3,4): 0 -> 1\n- (3,3): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid after all rounds is:\n```\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of numbers:\n`010011011100011011011101`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n`<<<0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1>>>`"
