  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=3 and the number of buttons=2, the initial network is:\n010\n101\n010\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\nRound 2: Button B\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and update the grid accordingly. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     0 1 0\n     1 0 1\n     0 1 0\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a list: <<<0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0>>>\n\n2. **Button A Operations:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"3\"] and [\"2\", \"1\"].\n   - In a 3x3 grid, these positions correspond to:\n     - [\"2\", \"3\"] is the light at row 2, column 3 (index 5 in the list).\n     - [\"2\", \"1\"] is the light at row 2, column 1 (index 3 in the list).\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the lights at these positions:\n     - Light at index 5 (initially 1) becomes 0.\n     - Light at index 3 (initially 1) becomes 0.\n   - Updated grid after Button A:\n     ```\n     0 1 0\n     0 0 0\n     0 1 0\n     ```\n   - Updated list: <<<0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0>>>\n\n3. **Button B Operations:**\n   - Button B controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], and [\"1\", \"1\"].\n   - In a 3x3 grid, these positions correspond to:\n     - [\"2\", \"1\"] is the light at row 2, column 1 (index 3 in the list).\n     - [\"2\", \"2\"] is the light at row 2, column 2 (index 4 in the list).\n     - [\"1\", \"1\"] is the light at row 1, column 1 (index 0 in the list).\n   - Pressing Button B will toggle the lights at these positions:\n     - Light at index 3 (initially 0) becomes 1.\n     - Light at index 4 (initially 0) becomes 1.\n     - Light at index 0 (initially 0) becomes 1.\n   - Updated grid after Button B:\n     ```\n     1 1 0\n     1 1 0\n     0 1 0\n     ```\n   - Updated list: <<<1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0>>>\n\nAfter all rounds of operation, the final state of the grid is represented as <<<1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0>>>."
