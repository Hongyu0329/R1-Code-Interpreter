  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n00\n11\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A on the initial light grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Initial State:**\n   - We have a 2x2 grid.\n   - The initial state of the grid is:\n     ```\n     0 0\n     1 1\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a list: <<<0,0,1,1>>>.\n\n2. **Identify the Button's Effect:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"1\"] and [\"1\", \"1\"].\n   - In a 2x2 grid, the positions can be mapped as follows:\n     - [\"1\", \"1\"] corresponds to the top-left corner (first row, first column).\n     - [\"2\", \"1\"] corresponds to the bottom-left corner (second row, first column).\n\n3. **Apply the Button's Effect:**\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the state of the lights at the specified positions.\n   - Toggling means changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.\n\n4. **Toggle the Lights:**\n   - Initial state: <<<0,0,1,1>>>\n   - Toggle [\"1\", \"1\"] (top-left corner):\n     - The light at [\"1\", \"1\"] is 0, so it becomes 1.\n     - New state: <<<1,0,1,1>>>\n   - Toggle [\"2\", \"1\"] (bottom-left corner):\n     - The light at [\"2\", \"1\"] is 1, so it becomes 0.\n     - Final state: <<<1,0,0,1>>>\n\n5. **Output the Final State:**\n   - After pressing Button A, the final state of the grid is <<<1,0,0,1>>>.\n\nAnswer: <<<1,0,0,1>>>"
