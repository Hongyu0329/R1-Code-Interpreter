  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=5 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n01011\n10100\n11101\n10100\n00111\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"3\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"2\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"5\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"5\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\nRound 2: Button B\nRound 3: Button A\nRound 4: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the pressing of buttons on the grid and observe how the lights change state. Each button press toggles the state of specific lights from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls:\n- **Button A**: Toggles lights at positions (1, 3) and (2, 3).\n- **Button B**: Toggles lights at positions (4, 3) and (4, 2).\n- **Button C**: Toggles lights at positions (5, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (1, 5), and (2, 5).\n\n### Rounds of Button Presses:\n1. **Round 1: Button A**\n   - Toggle (1, 3): 0 becomes 1\n   - Toggle (2, 3): 1 becomes 0\n\n   Resulting grid:\n   ```\n   0 1 1 1 1\n   1 0 0 0 0\n   1 1 1 0 1\n   1 0 1 0 0\n   0 0 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 2: Button B**\n   - Toggle (4, 3): 1 becomes 0\n   - Toggle (4, 2): 0 becomes 1\n\n   Resulting grid:\n   ```\n   0 1 1 1 1\n   1 0 0 0 0\n   1 1 1 0 1\n   1 1 0 0 0\n   0 0 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle (1, 3): 1 becomes 0\n   - Toggle (2, 3): 0 becomes 1\n\n   Resulting grid:\n   ```\n   0 1 0 1 1\n   1 0 1 0 0\n   1 1 1 0 1\n   1 1 0 0 0\n   0 0 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Round 4: Button A**\n   - Toggle (1, 3): 0 becomes 1\n   - Toggle (2, 3): 1 becomes 0\n\n   Final grid:\n   ```\n   0 1 1 1 1\n   1 0 0 0 0\n   1 1 1 0 1\n   1 1 0 0 0\n   0 0 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final state of the grid, represented as a single line of numbers, is:\n```\n0111110000111011100011111\n```"
