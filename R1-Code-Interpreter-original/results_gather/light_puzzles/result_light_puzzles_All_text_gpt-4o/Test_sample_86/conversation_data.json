    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 0 1 1\n     0 1 0 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Details:**\n   - **Button A** controls the lights at positions (2, 2) and (4, 2).\n   - **Button B** controls the lights at positions (2, 2), (4, 2), and (1, 3).\n\n3. **Round 1: Button B is pressed.**\n   - Toggle the light at (2, 2): It changes from 1 to 0.\n   - Toggle the light at (4, 2): It changes from 1 to 0.\n   - Toggle the light at (1, 3): It changes from 1 to 0.\n   - The grid after Round 1:\n     ```\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     0 0 1 1\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button A is pressed.**\n   - Toggle the light at (2, 2): It changes from 0 to 1.\n   - Toggle the light at (4, 2): It changes from 0 to 1.\n   - The grid after Round 2:\n     ```\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 1 0 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     0 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button B is pressed again.**\n   - Toggle the light at (2, 2): It changes from 1 to 0.\n   - Toggle the light at (4, 2): It changes from 1 to 0.\n   - Toggle the light at (1, 3): It changes from 0 to 1.\n   - The grid after Round 3:\n     ```\n     1 0 1 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     0 0 1 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - Convert the final grid into a single line representation:\n     ```\n     1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1>>>"
