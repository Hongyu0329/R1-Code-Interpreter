    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     11111\n     01100\n     01110\n     10000\n     11010\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Analysis:**\n   - **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (1,5), (2,5), (5,3), (4,3), (2,3), (4,4), (1,4).\n   - **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (2,4), (3,3), (2,3).\n   - **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (1,3), (3,5).\n\n3. **Round 1: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A:\n     - (1,5): 1 -> 0\n     - (2,5): 0 -> 1\n     - (5,3): 0 -> 1\n     - (4,3): 0 -> 1\n     - (2,3): 1 -> 0\n     - (4,4): 0 -> 1\n     - (1,4): 1 -> 0\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     11100\n     01010\n     01110\n     10110\n     11110\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A again:\n     - (1,5): 0 -> 1\n     - (2,5): 1 -> 0\n     - (5,3): 1 -> 0\n     - (4,3): 1 -> 0\n     - (2,3): 0 -> 1\n     - (4,4): 1 -> 0\n     - (1,4): 0 -> 1\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     11111\n     01100\n     01110\n     10000\n     11000\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C:\n     - (1,3): 1 -> 0\n     - (3,5): 0 -> 1\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     11011\n     01100\n     01111\n     10000\n     11000\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C again:\n     - (1,3): 0 -> 1\n     - (3,5): 1 -> 0\n   - Final grid:\n     ```\n     11111\n     01100\n     01110\n     10000\n     11000\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     <<<1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0>>>"
