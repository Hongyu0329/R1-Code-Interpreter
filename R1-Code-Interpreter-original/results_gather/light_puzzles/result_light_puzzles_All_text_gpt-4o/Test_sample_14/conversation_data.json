    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Button Effects\n- **Button A** toggles the lights at positions: (4,5), (4,1), (2,5), (5,4)\n- **Button B** toggles the lights at positions: (2,2), (4,4), (1,2), (5,4)\n- **Button C** toggles the lights at positions: (4,1), (4,5), (5,4), (2,2), (5,5), (1,2), (1,3)\n\n### Round 1: Button C\nToggle the lights at the specified positions:\n- (4,1): 1 -> 0\n- (4,5): 1 -> 0\n- (5,4): 0 -> 1\n- (2,2): 0 -> 1\n- (5,5): 1 -> 0\n- (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- (1,3): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button C\nToggle the lights at the same positions again:\n- (4,1): 0 -> 1\n- (4,5): 0 -> 1\n- (5,4): 1 -> 0\n- (2,2): 1 -> 0\n- (5,5): 0 -> 1\n- (1,2): 0 -> 1\n- (1,3): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button B\nToggle the lights at the specified positions:\n- (2,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,4): 0 -> 1\n- (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- (5,4): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button B\nToggle the lights at the same positions again:\n- (2,2): 1 -> 0\n- (4,4): 1 -> 0\n- (1,2): 0 -> 1\n- (5,4): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid after all rounds of operations is:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of numbers:\n```\n<<<1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1>>>\n```\n\nThis is the final answer."
