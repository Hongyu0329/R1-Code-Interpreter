    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing each button in sequence on the initial grid. Each button press toggles the state of specific lights (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) as specified in the problem. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls: (5,3), (3,4), (2,1), (5,4), (1,1), (3,1), (5,5), (3,2), (4,5)\n- **Button B** controls: (3,4), (3,2), (1,5)\n- **Button C** controls: (3,5), (5,2), (2,3), (2,1), (1,3), (4,3), (5,1), (3,2), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n### Round 1: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (3,4): 0 -> 1\n- (3,2): 1 -> 0\n- (1,5): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button C\nToggle the lights controlled by Button C:\n- (3,5): 1 -> 0\n- (5,2): 1 -> 0\n- (2,3): 1 -> 0\n- (2,1): 0 -> 1\n- (1,3): 1 -> 0\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,5): 0 -> 1\n- (5,5): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button C\nToggle the lights controlled by Button C again:\n- (3,5): 0 -> 1\n- (5,2): 0 -> 1\n- (2,3): 0 -> 1\n- (2,1): 1 -> 0\n- (1,3): 0 -> 1\n- (4,3): 0 -> 1\n- (5,1): 1 -> 0\n- (3,2): 1 -> 0\n- (4,5): 1 -> 0\n- (5,5): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A:\n- (5,3): 0 -> 1\n- (3,4): 1 -> 0\n- (2,1): 0 -> 1\n- (5,4): 1 -> 0\n- (1,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,1): 1 -> 0\n- (5,5): 0 -> 1\n- (3,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,5): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid, represented as a single line of 0s and 1s, is:\n```\n<<<1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1>>>\n```"
