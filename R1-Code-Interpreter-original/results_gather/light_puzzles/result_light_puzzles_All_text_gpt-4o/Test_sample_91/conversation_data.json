  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=4 and the number of buttons=2, the initial network is:\n0100\n1001\n1111\n1110\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"2\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button B\nRound 2: Button A\nRound 3: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. The grid is a 4x4 matrix, and we have two buttons, A and B, that control specific lights. We will apply the button presses in the given order and update the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls:\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (3,2)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (1,4), (3,1), (2,3), (4,1), (2,1)\n\n### Round 1: Button B\n- Toggle (1,4): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (3,1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2,3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (4,1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2,1): 1 -> 0\n\nUpdated Grid:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\n- Toggle (1,4): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1,3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (3,2): 1 -> 0\n\nUpdated Grid:\n```\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button A\n- Toggle (1,4): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1,3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1,2): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (3,2): 0 -> 1\n\nFinal Grid:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Final Result:\nThe final grid can be represented as a single sequence of 0s and 1s:\n```\n<<<0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0>>>\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0>>>"
