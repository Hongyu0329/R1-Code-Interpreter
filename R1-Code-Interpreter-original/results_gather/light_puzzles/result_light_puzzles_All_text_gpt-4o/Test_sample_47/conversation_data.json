    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the pressing of buttons on the grid and observe how the lights change state. Each button press toggles the state of specific lights from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5, and the initial state is:\n     ```\n     10011\n     00110\n     10100\n     00110\n     10110\n     ```\n\n2. **Button A Controls:**\n   - Button A toggles the lights at positions: [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"3\", \"2\"]\n   - Convert these positions to zero-based indices: (1, 4), (0, 2), (2, 1)\n\n3. **Button B Controls:**\n   - Button B toggles the lights at positions: [\"5\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"5\"], [\"3\", \"4\"]\n   - Convert these positions to zero-based indices: (4, 3), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 3)\n\n4. **Button C Controls:**\n   - Button C toggles the lights at positions: [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"4\"]\n   - Convert these positions to zero-based indices: (2, 3), (4, 4), (4, 3)\n\n5. **Simulate Each Round:**\n\n   - **Round 1: Button A**\n     - Toggle lights at (1, 4), (0, 2), (2, 1)\n     - New grid:\n       ```\n       10111\n       00100\n       11100\n       00110\n       10110\n       ```\n\n   - **Round 2: Button B**\n     - Toggle lights at (4, 3), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 3)\n     - New grid:\n       ```\n       10011\n       00011\n       10011\n       01110\n       11001\n       ```\n\n   - **Round 3: Button C**\n     - Toggle lights at (2, 3), (4, 4), (4, 3)\n     - New grid:\n       ```\n       10011\n       00011\n       10001\n       01110\n       11000\n       ```\n\n   - **Round 4: Button B**\n     - Toggle lights at (4, 3), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 3)\n     - New grid:\n       ```\n       10111\n       00100\n       11110\n       01010\n       10111\n       ```\n\n6. **Final Grid:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     <<<1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1>>>"
