  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=3 and the number of buttons=2, the initial network is:\n100\n001\n001\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"2\"]\n\nRound 1: Button B\nRound 2: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 0 0\n     0 0 1\n     0 0 1\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a list: <<<1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1>>>\n\n2. **Button Control Details:**\n   - **Button A** controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"2\"] and [\"2\", \"1\"].\n   - **Button B** controls the lights at positions [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], and [\"1\", \"2\"].\n\n3. **Round 1: Press Button B**\n   - Button B affects the following positions:\n     - [\"3\", \"3\"] corresponds to grid position (3,3) or index 8 in the list.\n     - [\"2\", \"2\"] corresponds to grid position (2,2) or index 4 in the list.\n     - [\"1\", \"2\"] corresponds to grid position (1,2) or index 1 in the list.\n   - Toggle the lights at these positions:\n     - Index 8: 1 becomes 0\n     - Index 4: 0 becomes 1\n     - Index 1: 0 becomes 1\n   - Updated grid after Button B:\n     ```\n     1 1 0\n     0 1 1\n     0 0 0\n     ```\n   - List representation: <<<1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0>>>\n\n4. **Round 2: Press Button A**\n   - Button A affects the following positions:\n     - [\"2\", \"2\"] corresponds to grid position (2,2) or index 4 in the list.\n     - [\"2\", \"1\"] corresponds to grid position (2,1) or index 3 in the list.\n   - Toggle the lights at these positions:\n     - Index 4: 1 becomes 0\n     - Index 3: 0 becomes 1\n   - Final grid after Button A:\n     ```\n     1 1 0\n     1 0 1\n     0 0 0\n     ```\n   - List representation: <<<1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0>>>\n\nThe final result after all rounds of operation is: <<<1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0>>>"
