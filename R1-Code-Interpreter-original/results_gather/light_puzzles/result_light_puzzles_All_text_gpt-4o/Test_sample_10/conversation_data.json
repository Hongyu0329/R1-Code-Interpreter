    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the sequence of button presses to determine the final state of the grid. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n11000\n00001\n10010\n10010\n11011\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (1,1), (4,4), (1,4), (4,2), (3,4), (1,3)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (5,3), (3,5), (3,3), (5,2), (1,3), (1,5), (4,3), (2,1)\n- **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (2,5), (5,1), (5,3), (2,4), (2,1), (5,4), (4,5), (4,2), (1,3)\n\n### Button Press Sequence\n1. **Round 1: Button C**\n2. **Round 2: Button C**\n3. **Round 3: Button C**\n4. **Round 4: Button B**\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Round 1: Button C\n- Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C.\n- Positions affected: (2,5), (5,1), (5,3), (2,4), (2,1), (5,4), (4,5), (4,2), (1,3)\n\nAfter toggling, the grid becomes:\n```\n11100\n10011\n10010\n11011\n01001\n```\n\n#### Round 2: Button C\n- Toggle the same positions again.\n\nAfter toggling, the grid becomes:\n```\n11000\n00001\n10010\n10010\n11011\n```\n\n#### Round 3: Button C\n- Toggle the same positions again.\n\nAfter toggling, the grid becomes:\n```\n11100\n10011\n10010\n11011\n01001\n```\n\n#### Round 4: Button B\n- Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button B.\n- Positions affected: (5,3), (3,5), (3,3), (5,2), (1,3), (1,5), (4,3), (2,1)\n\nAfter toggling, the grid becomes:\n```\n11001\n00011\n10111\n11111\n00011\n```\n\n### Final Grid\nThe final state of the grid after all rounds is:\n```\n11001\n00011\n10111\n11111\n00011\n```\n\n### Output\nThe final grid in a single line format is:\n```\n<<<1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1>>>\n```\n\nThis represents the final state of the grid after all button presses."
