  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n10\n01\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A on the initial grid configuration. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Configuration:**\n   - The grid is a 2x2 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     0 1\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as:\n     ```\n     [1, 0]\n     [0, 1]\n     ```\n\n2. **Button A's Control:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"1\", \"1\"] and [\"2\", \"1\"].\n   - In matrix terms, these positions correspond to:\n     - [\"1\", \"1\"] is the first row, first column (top-left corner).\n     - [\"2\", \"1\"] is the second row, first column (bottom-left corner).\n\n3. **Effect of Pressing Button A:**\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the state of the lights at the specified positions.\n   - Toggling means changing a 1 to a 0 and a 0 to a 1.\n\n4. **Applying Button A's Effect:**\n   - Start with the initial grid:\n     ```\n     [1, 0]\n     [0, 1]\n     ```\n   - Toggle the light at [\"1\", \"1\"]:\n     - The light at [\"1\", \"1\"] is currently 1. Toggling it changes it to 0.\n     - Updated grid:\n       ```\n       [0, 0]\n       [0, 1]\n       ```\n   - Toggle the light at [\"2\", \"1\"]:\n     - The light at [\"2\", \"1\"] is currently 0. Toggling it changes it to 1.\n     - Final grid after pressing Button A:\n       ```\n       [0, 0]\n       [1, 1]\n       ```\n\n5. **Result Representation:**\n   - The final grid is:\n     ```\n     [0, 0]\n     [1, 1]\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a single sequence: <<<0,0,1,1>>>\n\nTherefore, the result after all rounds of operation is: <<<0,0,1,1>>>"
