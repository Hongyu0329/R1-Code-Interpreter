    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   ```\n   00101\n   10110\n   00100\n   01101\n   00101\n   ```\n\n2. **Button Control Mapping:**\n   - **Button A** controls: (2,5), (5,5), (5,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,1), (3,2), (5,3), (5,1)\n   - **Button B** controls: (1,4), (2,4), (5,1), (3,5), (2,3), (5,2), (4,5), (3,4), (1,1), (4,4), (4,3), (1,5)\n   - **Button C** controls: (4,2), (4,5), (4,1), (3,5), (2,1), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (2,4)\n\n3. **Round 1: Button C**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button C.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     00101\n     11110\n     00111\n     10010\n     01101\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     00101\n     11100\n     11111\n     10100\n     10010\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A again.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     00101\n     11110\n     00111\n     01110\n     01101\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A once more.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     00101\n     11100\n     11111\n     01000\n     10010\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Grid Representation:**\n   - Convert the final grid into a single line representation:\n     ```\n     <<<0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer after all rounds of operation is:\n```\n<<<0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0>>>\n```"
