  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=4 and the number of buttons=2, the initial network is:\n0100\n1011\n0100\n1101\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"1\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"3\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\nRound 2: Button B\nRound 3: Button B\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the effects of pressing the buttons on the grid step by step. Let's analyze each round and update the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Button A Controls:\n- [\"1\", \"3\"] -> (0, 2)\n- [\"1\", \"2\"] -> (0, 1)\n- [\"2\", \"2\"] -> (1, 1)\n- [\"2\", \"4\"] -> (1, 3)\n- [\"3\", \"2\"] -> (2, 1)\n- [\"1\", \"1\"] -> (0, 0)\n\n### Button B Controls:\n- [\"1\", \"2\"] -> (0, 1)\n- [\"3\", \"4\"] -> (2, 3)\n- [\"3\", \"3\"] -> (2, 2)\n\n### Round 1: Button A\n- Toggle (0, 2): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (0, 1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (1, 1): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (1, 3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (0, 0): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button B\n- Toggle (0, 1): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 3): 0 -> 1\n- Toggle (2, 2): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button B\n- Toggle (0, 1): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 3): 1 -> 0\n- Toggle (2, 2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Grid:\n```\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Result in a Single Line:\nThe final grid can be represented as a single line of numbers:\n```\n1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1\n```\n\n**Answer:** 1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1"
