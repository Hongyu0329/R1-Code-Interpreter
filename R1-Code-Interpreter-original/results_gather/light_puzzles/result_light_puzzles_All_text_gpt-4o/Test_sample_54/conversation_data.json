  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n01\n00\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A on the given grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Initial State:**\n   - We have a 2x2 grid.\n   - The initial state of the grid is:\n     ```\n     0 1\n     0 0\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a list: <<<0,1,0,0>>>.\n\n2. **Identify the Button's Effect:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"1\", \"1\"] and [\"2\", \"1\"].\n   - In a 2x2 grid, these positions correspond to:\n     - [\"1\", \"1\"] is the light at the first row, first column (top-left corner).\n     - [\"2\", \"1\"] is the light at the second row, first column (bottom-left corner).\n\n3. **Apply the Button's Effect:**\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the state of the lights it controls.\n   - Toggling means changing a 0 to a 1, or a 1 to a 0.\n\n4. **Initial State and Toggling:**\n   - Initial state of the grid:\n     ```\n     0 1\n     0 0\n     ```\n   - Toggling the light at [\"1\", \"1\"] (top-left corner):\n     - Changes from 0 to 1.\n   - Toggling the light at [\"2\", \"1\"] (bottom-left corner):\n     - Changes from 0 to 1.\n\n5. **Final State of the Grid:**\n   - After pressing Button A, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     1 1\n     1 0\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a list: <<<1,1,1,0>>>.\n\nTherefore, the result after all rounds of operation is: <<<1,1,1,0>>>."
