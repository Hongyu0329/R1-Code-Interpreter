    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step according to the rounds specified. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (3,4), (2,5), (2,4), (5,1), (1,5), (5,4), (3,1), (1,4), (4,5), (5,2).\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (4,5), (1,3), (5,1), (5,5).\n- **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (4,3), (5,4), (4,1), (5,1), (3,4), (2,1), (5,3), (2,5), (5,2).\n\n### Round-by-Round Analysis\n\n#### Round 1: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A:\n- (3,4): 0 -> 1\n- (2,5): 0 -> 1\n- (2,4): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 1 -> 0\n- (1,5): 1 -> 0\n- (5,4): 1 -> 0\n- (3,1): 0 -> 1\n- (1,4): 0 -> 1\n- (4,5): 0 -> 1\n- (5,2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n#### Round 2: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A again:\n- (3,4): 1 -> 0\n- (2,5): 1 -> 0\n- (2,4): 0 -> 1\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (1,5): 0 -> 1\n- (5,4): 0 -> 1\n- (3,1): 1 -> 0\n- (1,4): 1 -> 0\n- (4,5): 1 -> 0\n- (5,2): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n#### Round 3: Button C\nToggle the lights controlled by Button C:\n- (4,3): 0 -> 1\n- (5,4): 1 -> 0\n- (4,1): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 1 -> 0\n- (3,4): 0 -> 1\n- (2,1): 0 -> 1\n- (5,3): 0 -> 1\n- (2,5): 0 -> 1\n- (5,2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n#### Round 4: Button C\nToggle the lights controlled by Button C again:\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (5,4): 0 -> 1\n- (4,1): 0 -> 1\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,4): 1 -> 0\n- (2,1): 1 -> 0\n- (5,3): 1 -> 0\n- (2,5): 1 -> 0\n- (5,2): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final grid after all rounds of operation is:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nRepresented as a single line of binary values:\n`11001010100110010000110010`"
