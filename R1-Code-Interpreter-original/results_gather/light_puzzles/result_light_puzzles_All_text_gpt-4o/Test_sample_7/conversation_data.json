  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. The grid is a 5x5 matrix, and each button press toggles the state of specific lights (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls:\n- **Button A**: [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"5\"]\n- **Button B**: [\"5\", \"3\"], [\"5\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"1\"]\n- **Button C**: [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"3\"]\n\n### Round 1: Button C\n- Toggle [\"1\", \"1\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"2\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"3\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"4\"]: 1 -> 0\n- Toggle [\"5\", \"3\"]: 1 -> 0\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"3\"]: 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\n- Toggle [\"1\", \"3\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"4\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"5\", \"5\"]: 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button C\n- Toggle [\"1\", \"1\"]: 1 -> 0\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"2\"]: 1 -> 0\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"3\"]: 1 -> 0\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"4\"]: 1 -> 0\n- Toggle [\"5\", \"3\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"3\"]: 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button C\n- Toggle [\"1\", \"1\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"2\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"3\", \"3\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"4\"]: 0 -> 1\n- Toggle [\"5\", \"3\"]: 1 -> 0\n- Toggle [\"4\", \"3\"]: 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Final Result:\nThe final grid is:\n```\n1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of numbers:\n<<<1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0>>>"
