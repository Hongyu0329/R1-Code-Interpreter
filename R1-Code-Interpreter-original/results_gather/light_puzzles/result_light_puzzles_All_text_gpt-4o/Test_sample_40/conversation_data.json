  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid of lights. The grid is a 5x5 matrix, and each button press toggles the state of specific lights (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
