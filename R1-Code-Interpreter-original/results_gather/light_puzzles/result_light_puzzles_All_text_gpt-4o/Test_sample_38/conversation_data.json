  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=5 and the number of buttons=3, the initial network is:\n11111\n01100\n00011\n00010\n01100\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"5\", \"2\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"5\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"5\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"4\"]\nButton C controls the lights at [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"5\"], [\"4\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"4\"]\n\nRound 1: Button C\nRound 2: Button C\nRound 3: Button C\nRound 4: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid of lights. Each button press toggles the state of the lights it controls. A light that is on (1) will turn off (0), and a light that is off (0) will turn on (1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid State:**\n   ```\n   11111\n   01100\n   00011\n   00010\n   01100\n   ```\n\n2. **Button Control Mapping:**\n   - **Button A** controls: (5,5), (2,1), (5,2)\n   - **Button B** controls: (2,1), (3,5), (4,4), (3,1), (2,5), (5,5), (1,4), (2,4)\n   - **Button C** controls: (2,2), (3,1), (2,5), (2,1), (3,5), (4,5), (2,4), (4,4), (5,3), (1,4)\n\n3. **Round 1: Button C**\n   - Toggle lights at: (2,2), (3,1), (2,5), (2,1), (3,5), (4,5), (2,4), (4,4), (5,3), (1,4)\n   - New grid state:\n     ```\n     11101\n     10011\n     10001\n     00000\n     01000\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button C**\n   - Toggle lights at: (2,2), (3,1), (2,5), (2,1), (3,5), (4,5), (2,4), (4,4), (5,3), (1,4)\n   - New grid state:\n     ```\n     11111\n     01100\n     00011\n     00010\n     01100\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button C**\n   - Toggle lights at: (2,2), (3,1), (2,5), (2,1), (3,5), (4,5), (2,4), (4,4), (5,3), (1,4)\n   - New grid state:\n     ```\n     11101\n     10011\n     10001\n     00000\n     01000\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 4: Button A**\n   - Toggle lights at: (5,5), (2,1), (5,2)\n   - New grid state:\n     ```\n     11101\n     00011\n     10001\n     00000\n     00000\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Grid State:**\n   - Convert the grid to a single line representation:\n     ```\n     <<<1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>>"
