    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     0 1 0 1\n     0 1 0 0\n     1 0 1 1\n     0 0 1 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Button A Controls:**\n   - Button A affects the following positions:\n     - [\"1\", \"3\"] -> (0, 2)\n     - [\"2\", \"3\"] -> (1, 2)\n     - [\"4\", \"1\"] -> (3, 0)\n     - [\"4\", \"3\"] -> (3, 2)\n\n3. **Button B Controls:**\n   - Button B affects the following positions:\n     - [\"2\", \"2\"] -> (1, 1)\n     - [\"2\", \"3\"] -> (1, 2)\n     - [\"1\", \"2\"] -> (0, 1)\n     - [\"4\", \"1\"] -> (3, 0)\n\n4. **Round 1: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A:\n     - (0, 2): 0 -> 1\n     - (1, 2): 0 -> 1\n     - (3, 0): 0 -> 1\n     - (3, 2): 1 -> 0\n   - Grid after Round 1:\n     ```\n     0 1 1 1\n     0 1 1 0\n     1 0 1 1\n     1 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 2: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button B:\n     - (1, 1): 1 -> 0\n     - (1, 2): 1 -> 0\n     - (0, 1): 1 -> 0\n     - (3, 0): 1 -> 0\n   - Grid after Round 2:\n     ```\n     0 0 1 1\n     0 0 0 0\n     1 0 1 1\n     0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A again:\n     - (0, 2): 1 -> 0\n     - (1, 2): 0 -> 1\n     - (3, 0): 0 -> 1\n     - (3, 2): 0 -> 1\n   - Final Grid after Round 3:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 1\n     0 0 1 0\n     1 0 1 1\n     1 0 1 0\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n     - <<<0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0>>>\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0>>>"
