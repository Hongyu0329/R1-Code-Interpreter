  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n10\n10\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"2\", \"2\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the initial state of the grid and understand how the button affects the lights. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - We have a 2x2 grid.\n   - The initial state of the grid is:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     1 0\n     ```\n   - This means:\n     - The light at position (1,1) is on.\n     - The light at position (1,2) is off.\n     - The light at position (2,1) is on.\n     - The light at position (2,2) is off.\n\n2. **Button Configuration:**\n   - We have one button, Button A.\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions (2,1) and (2,2).\n\n3. **Effect of Button A:**\n   - When Button A is pressed, it toggles the state of the lights it controls.\n   - Toggling means:\n     - If a light is on (1), it will be turned off (0).\n     - If a light is off (0), it will be turned on (1).\n\n4. **Applying Button A:**\n   - Initially, the light at (2,1) is on (1). After pressing Button A, it will be toggled to off (0).\n   - Initially, the light at (2,2) is off (0). After pressing Button A, it will be toggled to on (1).\n\n5. **Final Grid State:**\n   - After pressing Button A, the grid will be:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     0 1\n     ```\n   - This means:\n     - The light at position (1,1) remains on.\n     - The light at position (1,2) remains off.\n     - The light at position (2,1) is now off.\n     - The light at position (2,2) is now on.\n\n6. **Output Format:**\n   - The final state of the grid should be represented as a single line of numbers, row by row.\n   - Therefore, the final output is: <<<1,0,0,1>>>\n\nAnswer: <<<1,0,0,1>>>"
