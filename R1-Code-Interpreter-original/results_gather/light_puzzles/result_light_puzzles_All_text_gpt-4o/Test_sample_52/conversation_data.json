  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n10\n11\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A on the initial light grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 2x2 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     1 1\n     ```\n   - Here, \"1\" represents a lit light, and \"0\" represents an unlit light.\n\n2. **Identify the Lights Controlled by Button A:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"2\", \"1\"] and [\"1\", \"1\"].\n   - In matrix terms, [\"2\", \"1\"] refers to the light in the second row, first column, and [\"1\", \"1\"] refers to the light in the first row, first column.\n\n3. **Initial State of Controlled Lights:**\n   - Light at [\"2\", \"1\"] (second row, first column) is initially \"1\" (lit).\n   - Light at [\"1\", \"1\"] (first row, first column) is initially \"1\" (lit).\n\n4. **Effect of Pressing Button A:**\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the state of the lights it controls.\n   - Toggling means changing \"1\" to \"0\" and \"0\" to \"1\".\n\n5. **Apply the Toggle Operation:**\n   - For light at [\"2\", \"1\"]: It changes from \"1\" to \"0\".\n   - For light at [\"1\", \"1\"]: It changes from \"1\" to \"0\".\n\n6. **Resulting Grid After Pressing Button A:**\n   - The updated grid after toggling the specified lights is:\n     ```\n     0 0\n     0 1\n     ```\n\n7. **Convert the Grid to the Required Output Format:**\n   - The grid is represented as a single sequence of numbers, row by row.\n   - Therefore, the grid \"0 0\" and \"0 1\" becomes <<<0,0,0,1>>>.\n\nThe final answer, representing the grid after all operations, is:\n\n<<<0,0,0,1>>>"
