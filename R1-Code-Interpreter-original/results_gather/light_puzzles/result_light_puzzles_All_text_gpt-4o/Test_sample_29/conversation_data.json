    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step according to the rounds specified. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial 5x5 grid is:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (3,4), (2,2), (4,3), (4,1), (2,3)\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (3,4), (4,3), (1,2), (2,3), (2,1), (1,5), (5,4), (2,4), (4,5), (3,1), (5,5)\n- **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (1,4), (4,3), (3,1)\n\n### Round-by-Round Analysis\n\n#### Round 1: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A:\n- (3,4): 1 -> 0\n- (2,2): 1 -> 0\n- (4,3): 0 -> 1\n- (4,1): 0 -> 1\n- (2,3): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### Round 2: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A again:\n- (3,4): 0 -> 1\n- (2,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (4,1): 1 -> 0\n- (2,3): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### Round 3: Button A\nToggle the lights controlled by Button A once more:\n- (3,4): 1 -> 0\n- (2,2): 1 -> 0\n- (4,3): 0 -> 1\n- (4,1): 0 -> 1\n- (2,3): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### Round 4: Button C\nToggle the lights controlled by Button C:\n- (1,4): 0 -> 1\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (3,1): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid after all rounds of operation is:\n```\n0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of numbers:\n<<<0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0>>>"
