  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step according to the rounds specified. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls: (3,2), (4,1), (4,4), (4,5), (1,5), (1,4), (5,5), (2,3), (5,2)\n- **Button B** controls: (5,1), (4,2), (3,5), (3,1), (2,2)\n- **Button C** controls: (4,1), (3,4), (5,4), (5,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,5)\n\n### Round 1: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (5,1): 1 -> 0\n- (4,2): 0 -> 1\n- (3,5): 1 -> 0\n- (3,1): 0 -> 1\n- (2,2): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 1:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B again:\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (4,2): 1 -> 0\n- (3,5): 0 -> 1\n- (3,1): 1 -> 0\n- (2,2): 1 -> 0\n\nGrid after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button C\nToggle the lights controlled by Button C:\n- (4,1): 0 -> 1\n- (3,4): 1 -> 0\n- (5,4): 1 -> 0\n- (5,1): 1 -> 0\n- (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- (2,4): 0 -> 1\n- (4,5): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 3:\n```\n1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button B\nToggle the lights controlled by Button B:\n- (5,1): 0 -> 1\n- (4,2): 0 -> 1\n- (3,5): 1 -> 0\n- (3,1): 0 -> 1\n- (2,2): 0 -> 1\n\nGrid after Round 4:\n```\n1 0 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid after all rounds is:\n```\n1 0 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of numbers:\n```\n<<<1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0>>>\n```\n\nThis is the final answer."
