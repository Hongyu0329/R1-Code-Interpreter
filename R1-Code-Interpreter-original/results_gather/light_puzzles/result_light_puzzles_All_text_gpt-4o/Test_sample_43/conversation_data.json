  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step according to the rounds specified. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is given as:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls: [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"1\"]\n- **Button B** controls: [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"1\", \"5\"], [\"4\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"3\", \"1\"]\n- **Button C** controls: [\"3\", \"1\"], [\"5\", \"2\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"3\", \"4\"]\n\n### Rounds of Operation\n1. **Round 1: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button A.\n   - Positions: [\"1\", \"3\"], [\"3\", \"2\"], [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"5\", \"1\"], [\"3\", \"3\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"3\", \"1\"]\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     1 1 1 1 1\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     1 1 1 0 1\n     1 1 1 0 1\n     0 0 0 0 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 2: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the same positions again.\n   - After toggling, the grid reverts to:\n     ```\n     1 1 0 0 1\n     0 0 0 1 0\n     0 0 0 0 1\n     1 1 0 0 1\n     1 0 0 0 1\n     ```\n\n3. **Round 3: Button A**\n   - Toggle the lights at the same positions once more.\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     1 1 1 1 1\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     1 1 1 0 1\n     1 1 1 0 1\n     0 0 0 0 1\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 4: Button B**\n   - Toggle the lights at the positions controlled by Button B.\n   - Positions: [\"4\", \"3\"], [\"4\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"4\"], [\"2\", \"4\"], [\"1\", \"5\"], [\"4\", \"5\"], [\"2\", \"5\"], [\"3\", \"1\"]\n   - After toggling, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     1 1 1 0 0\n     0 0 0 1 1\n     0 1 1 0 1\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 1\n     ```\n\n### Final Grid\nThe final grid after all rounds of operation is:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final grid represented as a single line of 0s and 1s is:\n<<<1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1>>>"
