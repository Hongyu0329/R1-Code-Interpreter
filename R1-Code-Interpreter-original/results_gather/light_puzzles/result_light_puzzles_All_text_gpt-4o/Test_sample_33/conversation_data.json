    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and update the grid accordingly. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Button Control Mapping\n- **Button A** controls: (1,2), (4,3), (5,2), (3,3), (4,1), (5,3), (4,4), (5,5), (2,4)\n- **Button B** controls: (5,2), (1,5), (3,5), (4,4), (4,1), (5,5)\n- **Button C** controls: (2,4), (2,3), (5,5)\n\n### Round 1: Button C\nButton C toggles the lights at positions:\n- (2,4): 0 -> 1\n- (2,3): 1 -> 0\n- (5,5): 0 -> 1\n\nUpdated grid:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\nButton A toggles the lights at positions:\n- (1,2): 1 -> 0\n- (4,3): 0 -> 1\n- (5,2): 1 -> 0\n- (3,3): 1 -> 0\n- (4,1): 0 -> 1\n- (5,3): 0 -> 1\n- (4,4): 0 -> 1\n- (5,5): 1 -> 0\n- (2,4): 1 -> 0\n\nUpdated grid:\n```\n1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Button A\nButton A toggles the lights at positions:\n- (1,2): 0 -> 1\n- (4,3): 1 -> 0\n- (5,2): 0 -> 1\n- (3,3): 0 -> 1\n- (4,1): 1 -> 0\n- (5,3): 1 -> 0\n- (4,4): 1 -> 0\n- (5,5): 0 -> 1\n- (2,4): 0 -> 1\n\nUpdated grid:\n```\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 4: Button B\nButton B toggles the lights at positions:\n- (5,2): 1 -> 0\n- (1,5): 1 -> 0\n- (3,5): 1 -> 0\n- (4,4): 0 -> 1\n- (4,1): 0 -> 1\n- (5,5): 1 -> 0\n\nUpdated grid:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Result\nThe final grid after all rounds is:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this grid as a single line of binary values:\n```\n1100010010011101001100000\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0>>>"
