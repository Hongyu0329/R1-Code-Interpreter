  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button B on the grid of lights. We will go through each round and update the grid accordingly.\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Button B Controls:\nButton B affects the following positions:\n- [\"5\", \"5\"]\n- [\"3\", \"4\"]\n- [\"5\", \"3\"]\n- [\"5\", \"4\"]\n- [\"5\", \"1\"]\n- [\"3\", \"5\"]\n- [\"1\", \"5\"]\n- [\"2\", \"5\"]\n\n### Round 1: Press Button B\n- Toggle the state of the lights at the positions controlled by Button B.\n\n1. [\"5\", \"5\"] changes from 0 to 1\n2. [\"3\", \"4\"] changes from 0 to 1\n3. [\"5\", \"3\"] changes from 0 to 1\n4. [\"5\", \"4\"] changes from 1 to 0\n5. [\"5\", \"1\"] changes from 1 to 0\n6.
