  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n10\n11\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"2\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing Button A on the initial grid configuration. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid Configuration:**\n   - The grid is a 2x2 matrix.\n   - The initial state of the grid is:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     1 1\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as:\n     ```\n     [1, 0]\n     [1, 1]\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Button's Effect:**\n   - Button A controls the lights at positions [\"1\", \"1\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"].\n   - In a 2x2 grid, these positions correspond to:\n     - [\"1\", \"1\"] is the light at the first row, first column (1-based index), which is `1` in the grid.\n     - [\"1\", \"2\"] is the light at the first row, second column (1-based index), which is `0` in the grid.\n\n3. **Apply the Button's Effect:**\n   - Pressing Button A will toggle the state of the lights it controls.\n   - Toggling means changing `1` to `0` and `0` to `1`.\n\n4. **Toggle the Lights:**\n   - For position [\"1\", \"1\"] (first row, first column), the light is `1`. Toggling it changes it to `0`.\n   - For position [\"1\", \"2\"] (first row, second column), the light is `0`. Toggling it changes it to `1`.\n\n5. **Update the Grid:**\n   - After toggling, the first row of the grid changes from `[1, 0]` to `[0, 1]`.\n   - The second row remains unchanged as `[1, 1]` because Button A does not control any lights in the second row.\n\n6. **Final Grid Configuration:**\n   - The updated grid after pressing Button A is:\n     ```\n     0 1\n     1 1\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a flat list: <<<0, 1, 1, 1>>>\n\nTherefore, the result after all rounds of operation is: <<<0, 1, 1, 1>>>"
