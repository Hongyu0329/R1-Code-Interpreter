    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of each button press on the grid and apply the changes step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     0 1 1 0\n     1 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 1\n     1 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Button Control Analysis:**\n   - **Button A** controls the lights at positions: (3,3), (2,4), (2,3), (4,4), (3,4).\n   - **Button B** controls the lights at positions: (1,2), (4,1), (3,3).\n   - **Button C** controls the lights at positions: (1,1), (2,4), (4,1).\n\n3. **Round 1: Button B Pressed**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button B:\n     - (1,2): 1 -> 0\n     - (4,1): 1 -> 0\n     - (3,3): 0 -> 1\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     0 0 1 0\n     1 0 0 0\n     0 0 1 1\n     0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Round 2: Button C Pressed**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button C:\n     - (1,1): 0 -> 1\n     - (2,4): 0 -> 1\n     - (4,1): 0 -> 1\n   - Updated grid:\n     ```\n     1 0 1 0\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 0 1 1\n     1 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Round 3: Button C Pressed Again**\n   - Toggle the lights at positions controlled by Button C again:\n     - (1,1): 1 -> 0\n     - (2,4): 1 -> 0\n     - (4,1): 1 -> 0\n   - Final grid:\n     ```\n     0 0 1 0\n     1 0 0 0\n     0 0 1 1\n     0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - Convert the final grid to a single line representation:\n     - <<<0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0>>>\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0>>>"
