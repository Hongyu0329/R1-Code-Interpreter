  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=3 and the number of buttons=2, the initial network is:\n111\n111\n011\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"1\", \"1\"], [\"1\", \"2\"]\nButton B controls the lights at [\"1\", \"2\"], [\"3\", \"1\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\nRound 2: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of pressing the buttons on the grid of lights. We will go through each round and apply the changes to the grid based on the buttons pressed.\n\n### Initial Grid\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n### Button Controls\n- **Button A** controls the lights at positions [\"1\", \"1\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"].\n- **Button B** controls the lights at positions [\"1\", \"2\"] and [\"3\", \"1\"].\n\n### Round 1: Button A\n- **Effect of Button A**: Toggle the lights at positions [\"1\", \"1\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"].\n  - Position [\"1\", \"1\"]: Current state is 1, toggle to 0.\n  - Position [\"1\", \"2\"]: Current state is 1, toggle to 0.\n\nAfter pressing Button A, the grid becomes:\n```\n0 0 1\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Button A\n- **Effect of Button A**: Toggle the lights at positions [\"1\", \"1\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"] again.\n  - Position [\"1\", \"1\"]: Current state is 0, toggle to 1.\n  - Position [\"1\", \"2\"]: Current state is 0, toggle to 1.\n\nAfter pressing Button A again, the grid becomes:\n```\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n### Final Grid\nAfter all rounds, the final grid is:\n```\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n### Result Representation\nThe final grid in the required format (a single line of 0s and 1s) is:\n```\n<<<1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1>>>\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1>>>"
