  "question": "There is an n*n grid with some lights randomly distributed. A lit light is represented by 1, and an unlit light is represented by 0. There are some buttons which can change the state of the lights in certain positions when they are pressed, like turning some lights on or off. Different buttons may control the state of the same light.\nGiven n=2 and the number of buttons=1, the initial network is:\n00\n00\n\nButton A controls the lights at [\"2\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"2\"]\n\nRound 1: Button A\n\nPlease write the result after all rounds of operation based on the lights controlled by the button.\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a fully unlit light network.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect of pressing the button on the grid of lights. We have a 2x2 grid, and pressing Button A will toggle the lights at positions [\"2\", \"2\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"]. \n\nThe initial grid is:\n```\n00\n00\n```\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The grid is initially all zeros:\n   ```\n   0 0\n   0 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Button A Effect**: Button A toggles the lights at positions [\"2\", \"2\"] and [\"1\", \"2\"]. Toggling means changing a 0 to a 1 or a 1 to a 0.\n\n3. **Apply Button A**:\n   - Position [\"2\", \"2\"] corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the grid, which is initially 0. Toggling it changes it to 1.\n   - Position [\"1\", \"2\"] corresponds to the top-right corner of the grid, which is initially 0. Toggling it changes it to 1.\n\nAfter pressing Button A, the grid becomes:\n```\n0 1\n0 1\n```\n\nNow, let's represent this final state in the required format: <<<0,1,0,1>>>.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0,1,0,1>>>"
