    "To solve this problem, we need to find a path for the robot that starts at the initial position, visits all the goal positions at least once, and avoids the obstacle cells. The robot can move to adjacent cells, and we need to ensure that the path is valid according to the adjacency list provided.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Start at the initial position `C4,4`.\n2. Use a search algorithm to find a path that visits all the goals while avoiding obstacles.\n3. Ensure that the path is valid by checking against the adjacency list.\n4. Output the path as a JSON list.\n\nTo implement this, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid and find a valid path.
