    "To solve this problem, we need to find a path for the robot that starts at the initial position, visits all the goal positions at least once, and avoids the obstacle cells. The robot can only move to adjacent cells as defined in the adjacency list.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Position, Goals, and Obstacles:**\n   - Initial Position: `C4,2`\n   - Goals: `['C2,4', 'C3,3', 'C4,1', 'C1,2']`\n   - Obstacles: `['C4,3', 'C3,4', 'C4,4', 'C1,1', 'C2,3']`\n\n2. **Define the Adjacency List:**\n   - The adjacency list is provided, but we need to ensure that the robot does not move into any obstacle cells.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at `C4,2`.\n   - Use a search algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to explore paths from the initial position to cover all goals.\n   - Ensure that the path does not pass through any obstacles.\n   - The path should be a sequence of valid moves from the initial position to a position where all goals have been visited.\n\n4. **Implement the Search Algorithm:**\n   - We will use a simple search algorithm to find a valid path that meets the criteria.\n\nLet's implement the search algorithm in Python to find the path:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid and parameters\ninitial_position = \"C4,2\"\ngoals = {\"C2,4\", \"C3,3\", \"C4,1\", \"C1,2\"}\nobstacles = {\"C4,3\", \"C3,4\", \"C4,4\", \"C1,1\", \"C2,3\"}\nadjacency = {\n    \"C1,1\": [\"C1,2\", \"C2,1\"],\n    \"C1,2\": [\"C1,1\", \"C1,3\", \"C2,2\"],\n    \"C1,3\": [\"C1,2\", \"C1,4\", \"C2,3\"],\n    \"C1,4\": [\"C1,3\", \"C2,4\"],\n    \"C2,1\": [\"C2,2\", \"C1,1\", \"C3,1\"],\n    \"C2,2\": [\"C2,1\", \"C2,3\", \"C1,2\", \"C3,2\"],\n    \"C2,3\": [\"C2,2\", \"C2,4\", \"C1,3\", \"C3,3\"],\n    \"C2,4\": [\"C2,3\", \"C1,4\", \"C3,4\"],\n    \"C3,1\": [\"C3,2\", \"C2,1\", \"C4,1\"],\n    \"C3,2\": [\"C3,1\", \"C3,3\", \"C2,2\", \"C4,2\"],\n    \"C3,3\": [\"C3,2\", \"C3,4\", \"C2,3\", \"C4,3\"],\n    \"C3,4\": [\"C3,3\", \"C2,4\", \"C4,4\"],\n    \"C4,1\": [\"C4,2\", \"C3,1\"],\n    \"C4,2\": [\"C4,1\", \"C4,3\", \"C3,2\"],\n    \"C4,3\": [\"C4,2\", \"C4,4\", \"C3,3\"],\n    \"C4,4\": [\"C4,3\", \"C3,4\"]\n}\n\n# Remove obstacles from adjacency list\nfor obstacle in obstacles:\n    if obstacle in adjacency:\n        del adjacency[obstacle]\n    for key in adjacency:\n        if obstacle in adjacency[key]:\n            adjacency[key].remove(obstacle)\n\n# BFS to find a path that visits all goals\ndef bfs_path(start, goals):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start], set())])\n    while queue:\n        position, path, visited_goals = queue.popleft()\n        if visited_goals == goals:\n            return path\n        for neighbor in adjacency.get(position, []):\n            if neighbor not in path:\n                new_visited_goals = visited_goals | {neighbor} if neighbor in goals else visited_goals\n                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor], new_visited_goals))\n    return []\n\n# Find the path\npath = bfs_path(initial_position, goals)\nprint(path)\n```\n\nThis code will find a path that starts at `C4,2`, visits all the goals, and avoids obstacles.
