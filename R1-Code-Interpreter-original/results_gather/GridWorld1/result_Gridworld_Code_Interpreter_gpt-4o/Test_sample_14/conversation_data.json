    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find a path that starts at the initial position `C4,4`, visits all the goal cells at least once, and avoids the obstacle cells. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the grid and find a valid path.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position `C4,4`.\n2.
