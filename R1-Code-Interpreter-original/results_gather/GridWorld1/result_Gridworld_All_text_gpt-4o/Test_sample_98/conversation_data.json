    "To solve this Gridworld planning problem, we need to find a path that allows the robot to visit all the goal cells at least once, starting from the initial position, while avoiding obstacles. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Position and Goals:**\n   - Initial Position: C4,4\n   - Goals: C2,4, C2,1, C1,1, C3,4\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - Obstacles: C4,1, C4,2, C2,3, C1,4, C4,3\n\n3. **Understand the Adjacency and Movement Constraints:**\n   - The robot can move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right) as long as they are not obstacles.\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at C4,4.\n   - Move to C3,4 (adjacent to C4,4).\n   - From C3,4, move to C2,4 (goal).\n   - From C2,4, move to C1,4 (adjacent, but an obstacle, so skip).\n   - From C2,4, move to C2,3 (adjacent, but an obstacle, so skip).\n   - From C2,4, move to C2,2 (adjacent).\n   - From C2,2, move to C2,1 (goal).\n   - From C2,1, move to C1,1 (goal).\n   - From C1,1, move to C1,2 (adjacent).\n   - From C1,2, move to C2,2 (adjacent).\n   - From C2,2, move to C3,2 (adjacent).\n   - From C3,2, move to C3,3 (adjacent).\n   - From C3,3, move to C3,4 (goal).\n\n5. **Ensure All Goals are Visited:**\n   - C2,4, C2,1, C1,1, and C3,4 are all visited in the path.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - The path should be a JSON list of positions from the initial position to the final position after all goals have been visited.\n\nHere is the planned path:\n\n<<<[\"C4,4\", \"C3,4\", \"C2,4\", \"C2,2\", \"C2,1\", \"C1,1\", \"C1,2\", \"C2,2\", \"C3,2\", \"C3,3\", \"C3,4\"]>>>"
