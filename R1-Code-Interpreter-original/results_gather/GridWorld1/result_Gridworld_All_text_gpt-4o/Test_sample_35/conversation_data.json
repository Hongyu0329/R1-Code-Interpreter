    "To solve this Gridworld planning problem, we need to find a path for the robot that starts at the initial position, visits all the goal positions at least once, and avoids the obstacle cells. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Position:**\n   - The robot starts at position `C3,2`.\n\n2. **Identify the Goal Positions:**\n   - The goals are located at `C4,1`, `C4,4`, `C2,4`, and `C4,2`.\n\n3. **Identify the Obstacle Positions:**\n   - The obstacles are located at `C1,4`, `C3,3`, `C2,1`, `C2,2`, and `C2,3`.\n\n4. **Understand the Adjacency List:**\n   - The adjacency list provides the possible moves from each cell. The robot can move to any adjacent cell that is not an obstacle.\n\n5. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at `C3,2`.\n   - Move to `C4,2` (a goal position).\n   - Move to `C4,1` (another goal position).\n   - Move back to `C4,2` to reposition.\n   - Move to `C4,3`.\n   - Move to `C4,4` (another goal position).\n   - Move back to `C4,3`.\n   - Move to `C3,4`.\n   - Move to `C2,4` (the final goal position).\n\n6. **Ensure All Goals are Visited:**\n   - The path must visit all goal positions at least once.\n\n7. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - Ensure that the path does not pass through any obstacle cells.\n\n8. **Output the Path:**\n   - The path should be output as a JSON list enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nFollowing these steps, the path that satisfies all the conditions is:\n\n<<<[\"C3,2\", \"C4,2\", \"C4,1\", \"C4,2\", \"C4,3\", \"C4,4\", \"C4,3\", \"C3,4\", \"C2,4\"]>>>"
