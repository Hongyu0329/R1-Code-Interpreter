    "To solve this Gridworld planning problem, we need to find a path for the robot that starts at the initial position, visits all the goal positions at least once, and avoids the obstacle cells. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Position:**\n   - The robot starts at `C1,1`.\n\n2. **Identify the Goal Positions:**\n   - The goals are `C1,2`, `C4,1`, `C1,3`, and `C4,4`.\n\n3. **Identify the Obstacle Positions:**\n   - The obstacles are `C2,3`, `C3,3`, `C3,2`, `C2,4`, and `C3,4`.\n\n4. **Understand the Adjacency List:**\n   - The adjacency list provides the possible moves from each cell. We need to ensure that the robot only moves to adjacent cells that are not obstacles.\n\n5. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at `C1,1`.\n   - Move to `C1,2` (first goal).\n   - Move to `C1,3` (second goal).\n   - Move back to `C1,2` to access `C2,2`.\n   - Move to `C2,2`.\n   - Move to `C2,1`.\n   - Move to `C3,1`.\n   - Move to `C4,1` (third goal).\n   - Move back to `C3,1`.\n   - Move to `C4,1` again to access `C4,2`.\n   - Move to `C4,2`.\n   - Move to `C4,3`.\n   - Move to `C4,4` (fourth goal).\n\n6. **Ensure All Goals are Visited:**\n   - The path visits all goals: `C1,2`, `C1,3`, `C4,1`, and `C4,4`.\n\n7. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - The path avoids all obstacle cells: `C2,3`, `C3,3`, `C3,2`, `C2,4`, and `C3,4`.\n\n8. **Output the Path:**\n   - The path is a sequence of positions from the initial position to the final position after all goals have been visited.\n\nHere is the planned path:\n\n<<<[\"C1,1\", \"C1,2\", \"C1,3\", \"C1,2\", \"C2,2\", \"C2,1\", \"C3,1\", \"C4,1\", \"C3,1\", \"C4,1\", \"C4,2\", \"C4,3\", \"C4,4\"]>>>"
