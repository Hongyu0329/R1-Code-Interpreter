    "To solve this Gridworld planning problem, we need to carefully navigate the grid while avoiding obstacles and visiting all goal cells. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - Initial position of the robot is C2,4.\n   - Obstacles are located at C3,3, C1,1, C2,1, C3,1, and C4,4.\n   - Goals are located at C1,4, C3,2, C4,1, and C4,3.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - The robot cannot pass through obstacle cells.\n   - The robot must visit all goal cells at least once.\n   - The robot can only move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right).\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at C2,4.\n   - Move to C1,4 (goal).\n   - Move back to C2,4.\n   - Move to C3,4.\n   - Move to C4,3 (goal).\n   - Move to C4,2.\n   - Move to C3,2 (goal).\n   - Move to C4,2.\n   - Move to C4,1 (goal).\n\n4. **Path Considerations:**\n   - Ensure that the path does not pass through any obstacles.\n   - Ensure that all goals are visited at least once.\n   - The path should be efficient and avoid unnecessary moves.\n\n5. **Final Path:**\n   - The path should start at the initial position and end after visiting all goals.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the path is as follows:\n\n- Start at C2,4.\n- Move to C1,4 (goal).\n- Move back to C2,4.\n- Move to C3,4.\n- Move to C4,3 (goal).\n- Move to C4,2.\n- Move to C3,2 (goal).\n- Move to C4,2.\n- Move to C4,1 (goal).\n\nThe final JSON list of robot positions is:\n\n<<<[\"C2,4\", \"C1,4\", \"C2,4\", \"C3,4\", \"C4,3\", \"C4,2\", \"C3,2\", \"C4,2\", \"C4,1\"]>>>"
