    "To solve this Gridworld planning problem, we need to carefully navigate the grid while avoiding obstacles and visiting all goal cells. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Position and Goals:**\n   - Initial Position: C2,3\n   - Goals: C4,4, C3,2, C4,3, C4,1\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - Obstacles: C2,1, C3,4, C1,3, C1,2, C3,1\n\n3. **Understand the Adjacency and Movement Constraints:**\n   - The robot can move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right) as long as they are not obstacles.\n\n4. **Plan a Path:**\n   - Start at C2,3.\n   - Avoid obstacles and visit all goal cells.\n\n5. **Path Planning:**\n   - From C2,3, move to C2,2 (adjacent and not an obstacle).\n   - From C2,2, move to C3,2 (goal).\n   - From C3,2, move to C4,2 (adjacent and not an obstacle).\n   - From C4,2, move to C4,3 (goal).\n   - From C4,3, move to C4,4 (goal).\n   - From C4,4, move to C4,1 (goal).\n\n6. **Ensure All Goals are Visited:**\n   - The path visits all goals: C3,2, C4,3, C4,4, C4,1.\n\n7. **Output the Path:**\n   - The path should be a JSON list of positions from the initial position to the final position after all goals have been visited.\n\nThe final path is:\n<<<[\"C2,3\", \"C2,2\", \"C3,2\", \"C4,2\", \"C4,3\", \"C4,4\", \"C4,1\"]>>>"
