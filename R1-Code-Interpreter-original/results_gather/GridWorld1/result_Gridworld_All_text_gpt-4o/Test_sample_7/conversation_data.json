    "To solve this Gridworld planning problem, we need to carefully navigate the grid while avoiding obstacles and ensuring that all goal cells are visited at least once. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Position and Goals:**\n   - Initial Position: C4,2\n   - Goals: C2,4, C1,4, C2,2, C4,3\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - Obstacles: C3,3, C3,1, C4,1, C2,3, C1,3\n\n3. **Understand the Adjacency and Movement Constraints:**\n   - The robot can move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) as long as they are not obstacles.\n\n4. **Plan a Path:**\n   - Start at C4,2.\n   - Move to C4,3 (goal).\n   - Move to C4,4.\n   - Move to C3,4.\n   - Move to C2,4 (goal).\n   - Move to C1,4 (goal).\n   - Move to C1,3 (obstacle, cannot move here).\n   - Move to C1,2.\n   - Move to C2,2 (goal).\n\n5. **Ensure All Goals are Visited:**\n   - C4,3, C2,4, C1,4, and C2,2 are all visited in the path.\n\n6. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - Ensure the path does not pass through any of the obstacle cells.\n\n7. **Output the Path:**\n   - The path should be a JSON list of positions from the initial position to the final position after all goals have been visited.\n\nFollowing these steps, the path is:\n\n- Start at C4,2\n- Move to C4,3 (goal)\n- Move to C4,4\n- Move to C3,4\n- Move to C2,4 (goal)\n- Move to C1,4 (goal)\n- Move to C1,2\n- Move to C2,2 (goal)\n\nThe final path is:\n\n<<<[\"C4,2\", \"C4,3\", \"C4,4\", \"C3,4\", \"C2,4\", \"C1,4\", \"C1,2\", \"C2,2\"]>>>"
