    "To solve this Gridworld planning problem, we need to carefully analyze the grid, obstacles, goals, and adjacency list to determine a valid path for the robot. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Initial Position:**\n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - The initial position of the robot is C4,3.\n\n2. **Obstacles:**\n   - The robot cannot pass through the following cells: C2,2, C4,4, C2,3, C1,2, C4,2.\n\n3. **Goals:**\n   - The robot must visit the following cells: C3,4, C3,3, C2,4, C2,1.\n\n4. **Adjacency:**\n   - The adjacency list provides the possible moves from each cell, but we must avoid moving into obstacle cells.\n\n5. **Path Planning:**\n   - Start at C4,3.\n   - Plan a path that visits all goal cells while avoiding obstacles.\n\n6. **Path Construction:**\n   - From C4,3, move to C3,3 (goal).\n   - From C3,3, move to C3,4 (goal).\n   - From C3,4, move to C2,4 (goal).\n   - From C2,4, move to C1,4.\n   - From C1,4, move to C1,3.\n   - From C1,3, move to C1,1.\n   - From C1,1, move to C2,1 (goal).\n\n7. **Final Path:**\n   - Ensure the path starts at the initial position and visits all goals.\n\nThe final path, avoiding obstacles and visiting all goals, is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"C4,3\", \"C3,3\", \"C3,4\", \"C2,4\", \"C1,4\", \"C1,3\", \"C1,1\", \"C2,1\"]>>>"
