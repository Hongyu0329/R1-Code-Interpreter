    "To solve this Gridworld planning problem, we need to find a path for the robot that starts at the initial position, visits all the goal cells at least once, and avoids obstacle cells. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Position:**\n   - The robot starts at position `C3,4`.\n\n2. **Identify the Goal Positions:**\n   - The goals are located at `C3,2`, `C1,3`, `C1,1`, and `C2,2`.\n\n3. **Identify the Obstacle Positions:**\n   - The obstacles are located at `C4,3`, `C1,4`, `C4,1`, `C2,4`, and `C1,2`.\n\n4. **Understand the Adjacency List:**\n   - The adjacency list provides the possible moves from each cell. The robot can move to any adjacent cell that is not an obstacle.\n\n5. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at `C3,4`.\n   - Move to `C3,3` (adjacent to `C3,4`).\n   - Move to `C3,2` (goal position).\n   - Move to `C2,2` (goal position).\n   - Move to `C2,1` (adjacent to `C2,2`).\n   - Move to `C1,1` (goal position).\n   - Move to `C1,3` (goal position).\n\n6. **Ensure All Goals are Visited:**\n   - The path visits all goal positions: `C3,2`, `C1,3`, `C1,1`, and `C2,2`.\n\n7. **Avoid Obstacles:**\n   - The path does not pass through any obstacle cells.\n\n8. **Output the Path:**\n   - The path should be output as a JSON list enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the path is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"C3,4\", \"C3,3\", \"C3,2\", \"C2,2\", \"C2,1\", \"C1,1\", \"C1,3\"]>>>"
