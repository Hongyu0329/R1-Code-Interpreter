    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more changes can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the blocks**: Start with 2 [A], 4 [B], and 1 [C].\n2. **Apply the methods**: Cycle through the methods 1 to 6 repeatedly.\n3. **Check for changes**: After each cycle, check if any changes were made. If not, stop the process.\n4. **Count the final blocks**: Once no more changes can be made, count the number of each type of block.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to simulate the process and find the final configuration of blocks.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the blocks\nblocks = {\n    '[A]': 2,\n    '[B]': 4,\n    '[C]': 1,\n    '{A}': 0,\n    '{B}': 0,\n    '{C}': 0,\n    '(A)': 0,\n    '(B)': 0,\n    '(C)': 0\n}\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods(blocks):\n    changes = False\n    \n    # Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}\n    while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{A}'] += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}\n    while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{C}'] += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}\n    while blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{B}'] += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}\n    while blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n        blocks['{C}'] += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B)\n    while blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n        blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n        blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n        blocks['(A)'] += 1\n        blocks['(B)'] += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C)\n    while blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n        blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n        blocks['(C)'] += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    return changes\n\n# Cycle through methods until no more changes can be made\nwhile apply_methods(blocks):\n    pass\n\n# Prepare the final answer\nfinal_blocks = ''.join(f\"{blocks[block]} {block} \" for block in blocks if blocks[block] > 0).strip()\nprint(final_blocks)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the process and output the final configuration of blocks.

    "The code executed successfully and provided the final configuration of blocks. Based on the output, the synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 2 [B]\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 [B] 1 (A) 1 (B)>>>"
