    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the blocks**: Start with 4 [A], 7 [B], and 4 [C].\n2. **Apply the methods**: Cycle through the methods 1 to 6 and apply them as long as possible.\n3. **Check for changes**: After each cycle, check if any changes were made. If not, stop the process.\n4. **Count the final blocks**: Once no more changes can be made, count the number of each type of block.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to simulate the process:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the blocks\nblocks = {\n    '[A]': 4,\n    '[B]': 7,\n    '[C]': 4,\n    '{A}': 0,\n    '{B}': 0,\n    '{C}': 0,\n    '(A)': 0,\n    '(B)': 0,\n    '(C)': 0\n}\n\n# Define a function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods(blocks):\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{A}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}\n        while blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{B}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}\n        while blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B)\n        while blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n            blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n            blocks['(A)'] += 1\n            blocks['(B)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C)\n        while blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n            blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n            blocks['(C)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n\n    return blocks\n\n# Apply the methods\nfinal_blocks = apply_methods(blocks)\n\n# Print the final blocks\nprint(final_blocks)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out the final configuration of blocks.",
