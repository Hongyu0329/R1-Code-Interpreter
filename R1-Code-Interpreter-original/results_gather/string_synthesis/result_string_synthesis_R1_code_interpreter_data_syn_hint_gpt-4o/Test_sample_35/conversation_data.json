    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 2 [A], 4 [B], and 1 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 2 [A], 4 [B], and 1 [C]. We can apply this method once, resulting in:\n     - 1 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [A] and 3 [B]. We can apply this method once, resulting in:\n     - 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, and 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 0 [C], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [C], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 1 {C}. We can apply this method once, resulting in:\n     - 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Requires [A], [B], and [C], but we have none.\n- **Method 2**: Requires [A] and [B], but we have no [A].\n- **Method 3**: Requires [B] and [C], but we have no [C].\n- **Method 4**: Requires two [C], but we have none.\n- **Method 5**: Requires {A} and {C}, but we have none.\n- **Method 6**: Requires two {B}, but we have none.\n\nNo more methods can be applied. The final blocks are: 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\nThe synthesized block is 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n\n<<<(A)(B)>>>"
