    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 3 [A], 8 [B], and 2 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (since we have 2 [C] blocks).\n   - After applying, we have: 1 [A], 6 [B], 0 [C], and 2 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method 1 time (since we have 1 [A] block).\n   - After applying, we have: 0 [A], 5 [B], 1 {C}, and 2 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have no [C] blocks.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have no [C] blocks.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method 1 time (since we have 1 {C} block).\n   - After applying, we have: 1 (A), 6 [B], 1 (B), and 1 {A}.\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have no {B} blocks.\n\nNow, we cycle through the methods again:\n\n1. **Method 1**: We cannot apply this method because we have no [C] blocks.\n2. **Method 2**: We cannot apply this method because we have no [A] blocks.\n3. **Method 3**: We cannot apply this method because we have no [C] blocks.\n4. **Method 4**: We cannot apply this method because we have no [C] blocks.\n5. **Method 5**: We cannot apply this method because we have no {C} blocks.\n6. **Method 6**: We cannot apply this method because we have no {B} blocks.\n\nSince no more changes can be made, we have reached the final configuration. The synthesized blocks are: 1 (A), 6 [B], 1 (B), and 1 {A}.\n\n<<<1 (A), 6 [B], 1 (B), 1 {A}>>>"
