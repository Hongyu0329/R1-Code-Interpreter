    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly to the initial set of blocks until no more changes can be made. We start with 2 [A], 2 [B], and 2 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once with the initial blocks, resulting in 1 {A}, 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C].\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 1 {A}, 1 {C}, and 1 [C].\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have no [B] left.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have only 1 [C] left.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 1 (A), 1 (B), and 1 [C].\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have no {B}.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Not applicable as we don't have [A], [B], and [C].\n- **Method 2**: Not applicable as we don't have [A] and [B].\n- **Method 3**: Not applicable as we don't have [B].\n- **Method 4**: Not applicable as we don't have two [C].\n- **Method 5**: Not applicable as we don't have {A} and {C}.\n- **Method 6**: Not applicable as we don't have two {B}.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, the final synthesized blocks are 1 (A), 1 (B), and 1 [C].\n\n<<<1 (A), 1 (B), 1 [C]>>>"
