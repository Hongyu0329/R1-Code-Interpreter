    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 5 [A], 2 [B], and 1 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 5 [A], 2 [B], and 1 [C].\n   - After applying, we have 4 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 4 [A] and 1 [B].\n   - After applying, we have 3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, and 1 {C}.\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B] and 0 [C].\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 1 {A} and 1 {C}.\n   - After applying, we have 3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nNow, we cycle through the methods again, but no further combinations can be made because we don't have the required blocks for any method.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are:\n- 3 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n\n<<<1 (A) and 1 (B)>>>"
