    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the blocks**: Start with 5 [A], 7 [B], and 1 [C].\n2. **Apply the methods**: Follow the rules in sequence and update the counts of each block type.\n3. **Repeat the process**: Continue applying the methods until no further combinations are possible.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the final count of each block type.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the blocks\nblocks = {'[A]': 5, '[B]': 7, '[C]': 1, '{A}': 0, '{B}': 0, '{C}': 0, '(A)': 0, '(B)': 0, '(C)': 0}\n\n# Define a flag to check if any changes were made\nchanges_made = True\n\n# Repeat the process until no more changes can be made\nwhile changes_made:\n    changes_made = False\n    \n    # Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}\n    while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{A}'] += 1\n        changes_made = True\n    \n    # Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}\n    while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{C}'] += 1\n        changes_made = True\n    \n    # Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}\n    while blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{B}'] += 1\n        changes_made = True\n    \n    # Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}\n    while blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n        blocks['{C}'] += 1\n        changes_made = True\n    \n    # Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B)\n    while blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n        blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n        blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n        blocks['(A)'] += 1\n        blocks['(B)'] += 1\n        changes_made = True\n    \n    # Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C)\n    while blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n        blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n        blocks['(C)'] += 1\n        changes_made = True\n\n# Print the final counts of each block type\nprint(blocks)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final synthesized block configuration.",
    "The code execution result shows the final counts of each block type after applying the given methods repeatedly.
