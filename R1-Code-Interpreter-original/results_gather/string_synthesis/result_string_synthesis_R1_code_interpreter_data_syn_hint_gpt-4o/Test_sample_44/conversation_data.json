    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial quantities of blocks: 5 [A], 7 [B], and 2 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of [C] blocks).\n   - After applying, we have: 3 [A], 5 [B], 0 [C], and 2 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method 3 times (limited by the number of [A] blocks).\n   - After applying, we have: 0 [A], 2 [B], 3 {C}, and 2 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of [B] blocks).\n   - After applying, we have: 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 {B}, 1 {C}, and 2 {A}.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have no [C] blocks left.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of {C} blocks).\n   - After applying, we have: 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 {A}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have only 1 {B} block.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Cannot be applied (no [C] blocks).\n- **Method 2**: Cannot be applied (no [A] blocks).\n- **Method 3**: Cannot be applied (no [B] blocks).\n- **Method 4**: Cannot be applied (no [C] blocks).\n- **Method 5**: Cannot be applied (no {C} blocks).\n- **Method 6**: Cannot be applied (only 1 {B} block).\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 0 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 1 {A}\n- 1 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe final answer is a string representing the number of each type of block in the order: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n\n<<<001110110>>>"
