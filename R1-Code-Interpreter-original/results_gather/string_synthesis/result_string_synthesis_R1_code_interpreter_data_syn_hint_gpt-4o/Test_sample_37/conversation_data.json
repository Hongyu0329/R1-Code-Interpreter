    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 2 [A], 2 [B], and 4 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method twice because we have 2 [A], 2 [B], and 4 [C].\n   - After applying this method twice, we will have 0 [A], 0 [B], 2 [C], and 2 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A] and 0 [B].\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 2 [C].\n   - After applying this method, we will have 0 [C] and 1 {C}.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 2 {A} and 1 {C}.\n   - After applying this method, we will have 1 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Not applicable (0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C]).\n- **Method 2**: Not applicable (0 [A], 0 [B]).\n- **Method 3**: Not applicable (0 [B]).\n- **Method 4**: Not applicable (0 [C]).\n- **Method 5**: Not applicable (1 {A}, 0 {C}).\n- **Method 6**: Not applicable (0 {B}).\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state. The final blocks are:\n\n- 1 {A}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n\nNow, let's format the answer as a string of the number of each block type.\n\n```python\n# Final block counts\nblock_counts = {\n    '{A}': 1,\n    '(A)': 1,\n    '(B)': 1\n}\n\n# Format the answer\nanswer = ''.join(f\"{count} {block}\" for block, count in block_counts.items())\nprint(answer)\n```",
    "The code execution result shows that the output is not formatted correctly. The task requires a string of the number of each block type, but the output is not separated by spaces or commas. Let's correct the formatting issue and ensure the output is clear and matches the expected format.\n\nWe will modify the code to include spaces between the block counts and types, and ensure the output is clear and readable.\n\n```python\n# Final block counts\nblock_counts = {\n    '{A}': 1,\n    '(A)': 1,\n    '(B)': 1\n}\n\n# Format the answer with spaces between counts and block types\nanswer = ' '.join(f\"{count} {block}\" for block, count in block_counts.items())\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected code to get the properly formatted output.",
    "The code execution result shows that the output is now formatted correctly, with spaces between the block counts and types. However, the task requires a string of the number of each block type, which should be a concise representation of the final synthesized blocks.\n\nLet's revisit the problem and ensure that we are providing the correct final answer. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 1 {A}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n\nThe task requires us to return a string of the number of each block type. Given the context, it seems the expected format might be a more concise representation, such as a single string that summarizes the final state.\n\nSince the problem statement does not specify a particular format beyond \"a string of the number of certain block,\" let's assume it means a simple concatenation of the counts of each block type without additional formatting.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, representing the counts of each block type, is:\n\n<<<\"111\">>>"
