    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with 4 [A], 5 [B], and 5 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method as long as we have at least one of each [A], [B], and [C].\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method as long as we have at least one [A] and one [B].\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method as long as we have at least one [B] and one [C].\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method as long as we have at least two [C].\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method as long as we have at least one {A} and one {C}.\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method as long as we have at least two {B}.\n\nWe will implement this process in Python to simulate the combinations and determine the final state of the blocks.\n\n```python\n# Initial counts of blocks\nblocks = {\n    '[A]': 4,\n    '[B]': 5,\n    '[C]': 5,\n    '{A}': 0,\n    '{B}': 0,\n    '{C}': 0,\n    '(A)': 0,\n    '(B)': 0,\n    '(C)': 0\n}\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods(blocks):\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{A}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 2\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 3\n        while blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{B}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 4\n        while blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 5\n        while blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n            blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n            blocks['(A)'] += 1\n            blocks['(B)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 6\n        while blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n            blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n            blocks['(C)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n\napply_methods(blocks)\n\n# Output the final state of the blocks\nprint(blocks)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the blocks.",
