    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 1 [A], 1 [B], and 3 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 1 [A], 1 [B], and 3 [C]. We can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 0 [A], 0 [B], 2 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [A] and 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 0 [B] and 2 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 2 [C], so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 0 [C] and 1 {C}.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 1 {C}, so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\nNow, we have 1 (A) and 1 (B). No more methods can be applied since we don't have the required blocks for any of the methods. Therefore, the synthesized blocks are 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1 (A), 1 (B)>>>"
