    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the blocks**: Start with 5 [A], 7 [B], and 5 [C].\n2. **Apply the methods in sequence**:\n   - **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n3. **Repeat the process**: Continue applying the methods in order until no more combinations can be made.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the final configuration of blocks.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the blocks\nblocks = {\n    '[A]': 5,\n    '[B]': 7,\n    '[C]': 5,\n    '{A}': 0,\n    '{B}': 0,\n    '{C}': 0,\n    '(A)': 0,\n    '(B)': 0,\n    '(C)': 0\n}\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods(blocks):\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{A}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        while blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{B}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        while blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        while blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n            blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n            blocks['(A)'] += 1\n            blocks['(B)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        while blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n            blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n            blocks['(C)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n\napply_methods(blocks)\n\n# Output the final configuration of blocks\nprint(blocks)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final configuration of blocks.",
