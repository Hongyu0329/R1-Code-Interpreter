    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 1 [A], 1 [B], and 5 [C].\n\n2. **Applying the Methods:**\n   - **Method 1:** One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n     - Apply this method once: 1 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C] -> 1 {A}\n     - Remaining: 0 [A], 0 [B], 4 [C], 1 {A}\n\n   - **Method 4:** Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n     - Apply this method twice: 4 [C] -> 2 {C}\n     - Remaining: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 2 {C}\n\n   - **Method 5:** One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n     - Apply this method once: 1 {A}, 1 {C} -> 1 (A), 1 (B)\n     - Remaining: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 1 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\n   - **Method 6:** Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n     - We don't have any {B}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n3. **Final State:**\n   - We have 1 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, the final synthesized blocks are 1 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n<<<1 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)>>>"
