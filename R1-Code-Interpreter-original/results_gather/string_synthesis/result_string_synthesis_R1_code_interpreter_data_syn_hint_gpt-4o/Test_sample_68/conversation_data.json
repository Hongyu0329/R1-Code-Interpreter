    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 2 [A], 4 [B], and 1 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 1 {A}, 1 [A], 3 [B], and 0 [C].\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 1 {A}, 0 [A], 2 [B], 1 {C}.\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have no [C].\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have no [C].\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 {A}, 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have no {B}.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to ensure we have applied the rules correctly and to find the final configuration of blocks.\n\n```python\n# Initial counts of blocks\nA = 2\nB = 4\nC = 1\nA_curly = 0\nB_curly = 0\nC_curly = 0\nA_paren = 0\nB_paren = 0\nC_paren = 0\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods():\n    global A, B, C, A_curly, B_curly, C_curly, A_paren, B_paren, C_paren\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        if A >= 1 and B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            A_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        if A >= 1 and B >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        if B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            B_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        if C >= 2:\n            C -= 2\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        if A_curly >= 1 and C_curly >= 1:\n            A_curly -= 1\n            C_curly -= 1\n            A_paren += 1\n            B_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        if B_curly >= 2:\n            B_curly -= 2\n            C_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n\napply_methods()\n\n# Output the final configuration\nprint(f\"({A_paren})({B_paren})({C_paren})\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final configuration of blocks.",
    "The code execution result indicates that we have 1 (A), 1 (B), and 0 (C) after applying the methods. This result seems consistent with the logic we implemented, but let's verify the reasoning and ensure that the process was correctly followed.\n\n### Verification of Steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Start with 2 [A], 4 [B], and 1 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: \n   - Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - Result: 1 {A}, 1 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C].\n\n3. **Method 2**: \n   - Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - Result: 1 {A}, 0 [A], 2 [B], 1 {C}.\n\n4. **Method 5**: \n   - Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Result: 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 {A}, 0 {C}.\n\n5. **Other Methods**: \n   - Methods 3, 4, and 6 cannot be applied due to insufficient blocks.\n\nThe final configuration of blocks is indeed 1 (A), 1 (B), and 0 (C). This confirms that the code and logic were correctly implemented.\n\nTherefore, the synthesized block configuration is:\n\n<<<(1)(1)(0)>>>"
