    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 5 [A], 2 [B], and 7 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method as long as we have at least one of each [A], [B], and [C].\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - This can be applied as long as we have at least one [A] and one [B].\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - This can be applied as long as we have at least one [B] and one [C].\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - This can be applied as long as we have at least two [C].\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - This can be applied as long as we have at least one {A} and one {C}.\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - This can be applied as long as we have at least two {B}.\n\nWe will implement this process in Python to simulate the transformations and determine the final configuration of blocks.\n\n```python\n# Initial counts of blocks\ncount_A = 5\ncount_B = 2\ncount_C = 7\ncount_curly_A = 0\ncount_curly_B = 0\ncount_curly_C = 0\ncount_paren_A = 0\ncount_paren_B = 0\ncount_paren_C = 0\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods():\n    global count_A, count_B, count_C\n    global count_curly_A, count_curly_B, count_curly_C\n    global count_paren_A, count_paren_B, count_paren_C\n    \n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        \n        # Method 1\n        while count_A >= 1 and count_B >= 1 and count_C >= 1:\n            count_A -= 1\n            count_B -= 1\n            count_C -= 1\n            count_curly_A += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 2\n        while count_A >= 1 and count_B >= 1:\n            count_A -= 1\n            count_B -= 1\n            count_curly_C += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 3\n        while count_B >= 1 and count_C >= 1:\n            count_B -= 1\n            count_C -= 1\n            count_curly_B += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 4\n        while count_C >= 2:\n            count_C -= 2\n            count_curly_C += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 5\n        while count_curly_A >= 1 and count_curly_C >= 1:\n            count_curly_A -= 1\n            count_curly_C -= 1\n            count_paren_A += 1\n            count_paren_B += 1\n            changes = True\n        \n        # Method 6\n        while count_curly_B >= 2:\n            count_curly_B -= 2\n            count_paren_C += 1\n            changes = True\n\napply_methods()\n\n# Output the final counts of blocks\nresult = f\"{count_A} [A], {count_B} [B], {count_C} [C], {count_curly_A} {{A}}, {count_curly_B} {{B}}, {count_curly_C} {{C}}, {count_paren_A} (A), {count_paren_B} (B), {count_paren_C} (C)\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final configuration of blocks.",
