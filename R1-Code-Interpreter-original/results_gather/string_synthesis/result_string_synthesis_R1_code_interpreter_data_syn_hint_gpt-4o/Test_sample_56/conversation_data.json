    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 3 [A], 4 [B], and 6 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 3 times (limited by the number of [A] blocks), resulting in 3 {A} and reducing the count of [A], [B], and [C] by 3 each.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - After applying Method 1, we have 0 [A] and 1 [B], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We have 1 [B] and 3 [C] left, so we can apply this method once, resulting in 1 {B} and reducing the count of [B] and [C] by 1 each.\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We have 2 [C] left, so we can apply this method once, resulting in 1 {C} and reducing the count of [C] by 2.\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 3 {A} and 1 {C}, so we can apply this method once, resulting in 1 (A) and 1 (B), and reducing the count of {A} and {C} by 1 each.\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We have 1 {B}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure we have the correct final counts of each block type.\n\n```python\n# Initial counts\nA = 3\nB = 4\nC = 6\nA_curly = 0\nB_curly = 0\nC_curly = 0\nA_paren = 0\nB_paren = 0\nC_paren = 0\n\n# Apply methods until no more changes can be made\nwhile True:\n    changes = False\n    \n    # Method 1\n    while A > 0 and B > 0 and C > 0:\n        A -= 1\n        B -= 1\n        C -= 1\n        A_curly += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 2\n    while A > 0 and B > 0:\n        A -= 1\n        B -= 1\n        C_curly += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 3\n    while B > 0 and C > 0:\n        B -= 1\n        C -= 1\n        B_curly += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 4\n    while C > 1:\n        C -= 2\n        C_curly += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 5\n    while A_curly > 0 and C_curly > 0:\n        A_curly -= 1\n        C_curly -= 1\n        A_paren += 1\n        B_paren += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    # Method 6\n    while B_curly > 1:\n        B_curly -= 2\n        C_paren += 1\n        changes = True\n    \n    if not changes:\n        break\n\n# Output the final counts\nresult = f\"{A} [A], {B} [B], {C} [C], {A_curly} {{A}}, {B_curly} {{B}}, {C_curly} {{C}}, {A_paren} (A), {B_paren} (B), {C_paren} (C)\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final synthesized block configuration.",
    "The code execution result shows the final counts of each block type after applying the methods repeatedly. The result is:\n\n- 0 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 2 {A}\n- 1 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThis means that after all possible combinations, we end up with 2 {A}, 1 {B}, 1 (A), and 1 (B). \n\nThe synthesized block configuration is represented by the final counts of each block type. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\"0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 2 {A}, 1 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C)\">>>"
