    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 2 [A], 3 [B], and 7 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code to keep track of the blocks and apply the methods until no more changes can be made.\n\n```python\n# Initial blocks\nblocks = {'[A]': 2, '[B]': 3, '[C]': 7, '{A}': 0, '{B}': 0, '{C}': 0, '(A)': 0, '(B)': 0, '(C)': 0}\n\n# Function to apply methods\ndef apply_methods(blocks):\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{A}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        while blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{B}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        while blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        while blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n            blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n            blocks['(A)'] += 1\n            blocks['(B)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        while blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n            blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n            blocks['(C)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n\n    return blocks\n\n# Apply methods\nfinal_blocks = apply_methods(blocks)\n\n# Output the final blocks\nprint(final_blocks)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final synthesized block configuration.",
    "The code execution result shows the final configuration of blocks after applying the methods repeatedly. The result is:\n\n- 0 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 1 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 2 (A)\n- 2 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThis means that after applying all the methods, we end up with 1 {B}, 2 (A), and 2 (B). \n\nThe synthesized block configuration is represented by the final counts of each type of block. Since the problem asks for the synthesized block, we consider the non-zero blocks in the final configuration.\n\nTherefore, the synthesized block is:\n\n<<<1 {B}, 2 (A), 2 (B)>>>"
