    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 5 [A], 1 [B], and 3 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 1 [B]. After applying, we have:\n     - 4 [A], 0 [B], 2 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once. After applying, we have:\n     - 4 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, and 1 {C}.\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once. After applying, we have:\n     - 4 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nNow, we cycle through the methods again, but no further combinations can be made because we don't have the necessary blocks to apply any of the methods.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are:\n- 4 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\nThe synthesized block is a combination of these blocks. Since the problem asks for the synthesized block, we consider the blocks that are not in their original form ([A], [B], [C]):\n\n- 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n\nThus, the synthesized block is (A)(B).\n\n<<<(A)(B)>>>"
