    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in the order provided until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with 4 [A], 1 [B], and 3 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 4 [A], 1 [B], and 3 [C].\n   - After applying, we have 3 [A], 0 [B], 2 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 2 [C].\n   - After applying, we have 3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], and 1 {A}, 1 {C}.\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once because we have 1 {A} and 1 {C}.\n   - After applying, we have 3 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nNow, we cycle through the methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Cannot apply because we have 1 [B].\n- **Method 2**: Cannot apply because we have 1 [B].\n- **Method 3**: Cannot apply because we have 0 [C].\n- **Method 4**: Cannot apply because we have 0 [C].\n- **Method 5**: Cannot apply because we have 0 {A} and 0 {C}.\n- **Method 6**: Cannot apply because we have 0 {B}.\n\nSince no more combinations can be made, the final synthesized blocks are 3 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)>>>"
