    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with 1 [A], 7 [B], and 3 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 0 [A], 6 [B], 2 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method twice, resulting in 0 [A], 4 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, and 2 {B}.\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 0 [A], 4 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 0 {B}, and 1 (C).\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [A] and 0 [C].\n- **Method 2**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [A].\n- **Method 3**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [C].\n- **Method 4**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [C].\n- **Method 5**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 {C}.\n- **Method 6**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 {B}.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached the final state.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are: 0 [A], 4 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 0 {B}, and 1 (C).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<1 {A}, 4 [B], 1 (C)>>>"
