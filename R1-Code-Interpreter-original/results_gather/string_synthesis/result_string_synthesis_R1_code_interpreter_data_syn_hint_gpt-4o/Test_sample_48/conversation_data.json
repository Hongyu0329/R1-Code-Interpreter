    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 3 [A], 6 [B], and 7 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n\nWe will implement a loop to apply these methods until no more combinations can be made.
