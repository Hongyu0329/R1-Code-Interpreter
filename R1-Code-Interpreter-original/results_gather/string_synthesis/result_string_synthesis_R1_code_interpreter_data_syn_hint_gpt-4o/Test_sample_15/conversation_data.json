    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more changes can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with 1 [A], 5 [B], and 7 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n\nWe will implement a simulation of these steps using Python code to determine the final state of the blocks.\n\n```python\n# Initial counts of blocks\nA = 1\nB = 5\nC = 7\nA_curly = 0\nB_curly = 0\nC_curly = 0\nA_paren = 0\nB_paren = 0\nC_paren = 0\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods():\n    global A, B, C, A_curly, B_curly, C_curly, A_paren, B_paren, C_paren\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        while A >= 1 and B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            A_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        while A >= 1 and B >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        while B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            B_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        while C >= 2:\n            C -= 2\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        while A_curly >= 1 and C_curly >= 1:\n            A_curly -= 1\n            C_curly -= 1\n            A_paren += 1\n            B_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        while B_curly >= 2:\n            B_curly -= 2\n            C_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n\napply_methods()\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"[A]: {A}, [B]: {B}, [C]: {C}, {{A}}: {A_curly}, {{B}}: {B_curly}, {{C}}: {C_curly}, (A): {A_paren}, (B): {B_paren}, (C): {C_paren}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the blocks.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the final state of the blocks is: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), and 2 (C). This means that after applying all the methods repeatedly, we end up with these blocks.\n\nThe process involved applying each method in sequence until no more changes could be made, which is consistent with the problem's requirements. The final synthesized blocks are (A), (B), and (C).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(A): 1, (B): 1, (C): 2>>>"
