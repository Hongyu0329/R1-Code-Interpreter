    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will apply each method in sequence and repeat the cycle until no more changes can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with 1 [A], 6 [B], and 1 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 0 [A], 5 [B], 0 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state. Let's summarize the final state of the blocks:\n\n- [A]: 0\n- [B]: 5\n- [C]: 0\n- {A}: 1\n- {B}: 0\n- {C}: 0\n- (A): 0\n- (B): 0\n- (C): 0\n\nThe synthesized block is 1 {A}.\n\n<<<1 {A}>>>"
