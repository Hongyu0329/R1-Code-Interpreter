    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will apply each method in sequence and repeat the cycle until no more changes can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with 1 [A], 6 [B], and 7 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once, as we have 1 [A], 6 [B], and 7 [C].\n   - After applying, we have 0 [A], 5 [B], 6 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method 5 times, as we have 5 [B] and 6 [C].\n   - After applying, we have 0 [B], 1 [C], and 5 {B}.\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have 1 [C].\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method 2 times, as we have 5 {B}.\n   - After applying, we have 1 {B} and 2 (C).\n\nNow, let's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n```python\n# Initial counts of blocks\nA = 1\nB = 6\nC = 7\nA_curly = 0\nB_curly = 0\nC_curly = 0\nA_paren = 0\nB_paren = 0\nC_paren = 0\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods():\n    global A, B, C, A_curly, B_curly, C_curly, A_paren, B_paren, C_paren\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        if A >= 1 and B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            A_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        if A >= 1 and B >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        if B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            B_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        if C >= 2:\n            C -= 2\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        if A_curly >= 1 and C_curly >= 1:\n            A_curly -= 1\n            C_curly -= 1\n            A_paren += 1\n            B_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        if B_curly >= 2:\n            B_curly -= 2\n            C_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n\napply_methods()\n\n# Output the final counts of blocks\nprint(f\"[A]: {A}, [B]: {B}, [C]: {C}, {{A}}: {A_curly}, {{B}}: {B_curly}, {{C}}: {C_curly}, (A): {A_paren}, (B): {B_paren}, (C): {C_paren}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the final synthesized block.",
