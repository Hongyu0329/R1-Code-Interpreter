    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 3 [A], 2 [B], and 5 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 2 [A], 1 [B], 4 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 1 [A], 0 [B], 4 [C], 1 {A}, and 1 {C}.\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method twice, resulting in 1 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, and 3 {C}.\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 1 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 2 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nNow, we will cycle through the methods again to see if any more combinations can be made:\n\n- **Method 1**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [B].\n- **Method 2**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [B].\n- **Method 3**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [B].\n- **Method 4**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [C].\n- **Method 5**: Can be applied once, resulting in 1 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 1 {C}, 2 (A), and 2 (B).\n- **Method 6**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 {B}.\n\nAfter applying Method 5 again, we have:\n\n- 1 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 1 {C}, 2 (A), and 2 (B).\n\nWe will cycle through the methods one more time:\n\n- **Method 1**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [B].\n- **Method 2**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [B].\n- **Method 3**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [B].\n- **Method 4**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 [C].\n- **Method 5**: Can be applied once, resulting in 1 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 3 (A), and 3 (B).\n- **Method 6**: Cannot be applied because we have 0 {B}.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- 1 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 3 (A), and 3 (B).\n\nNo more combinations can be made. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 1 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 3 (A), and 3 (B).\n\nThe synthesized block is 3 (A) and 3 (B).\n\n<<<3 (A) and 3 (B)>>>"
