    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with 1 [A], 4 [B], and 7 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 0 [A], 3 [B], 6 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method three times, resulting in 0 [A], 0 [B], 3 [C], and 3 {B}.\n\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 1 {C}, and 3 {B}.\n\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 3 {B}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method once, resulting in 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B), and 1 (C).\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure accuracy and determine the final state of the blocks.\n\n```python\n# Initial counts of blocks\nA = 1\nB = 4\nC = 7\nA_curly = 0\nB_curly = 0\nC_curly = 0\nA_paren = 0\nB_paren = 0\nC_paren = 0\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods():\n    global A, B, C, A_curly, B_curly, C_curly, A_paren, B_paren, C_paren\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        while A >= 1 and B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            A_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        while A >= 1 and B >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        while B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            B_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        while C >= 2:\n            C -= 2\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        while A_curly >= 1 and C_curly >= 1:\n            A_curly -= 1\n            C_curly -= 1\n            A_paren += 1\n            B_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        while B_curly >= 2:\n            B_curly -= 2\n            C_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n\napply_methods()\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"({A_paren}, {B_paren}, {C_paren})\")\n\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final synthesized block.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the final synthesized block is (1, 1, 1), which corresponds to 1 (A), 1 (B), and 1 (C). This result is consistent with the application of the methods as described in the reasoning process. \n\nThe process involved applying each method in sequence until no further combinations could be made, resulting in the final state of the blocks.
