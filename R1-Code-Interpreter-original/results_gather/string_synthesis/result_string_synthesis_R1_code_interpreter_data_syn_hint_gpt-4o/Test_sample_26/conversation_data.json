    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the blocks**: Start with 4 [A], 7 [B], and 4 [C].\n\n2. **Apply the methods in sequence**: \n   - **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n\n3. **Repeat the process**: Continue applying the methods in order until no more combinations can be made.\n\n4. **Count the final blocks**: After the process is complete, count the number of each type of block.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to determine the final configuration of blocks.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the blocks\nblocks = {\n    '[A]': 4,\n    '[B]': 7,\n    '[C]': 4,\n    '{A}': 0,\n    '{B}': 0,\n    '{C}': 0,\n    '(A)': 0,\n    '(B)': 0,\n    '(C)': 0\n}\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods(blocks):\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{A}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        while blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{B}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        while blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        while blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n            blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n            blocks['(A)'] += 1\n            blocks['(B)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        while blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n            blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n            blocks['(C)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n\n# Apply the methods\napply_methods(blocks)\n\n# Output the final blocks\nprint(blocks)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final configuration of blocks.",
    "The code execution result shows that we have 4 {A} blocks and 3 [B] blocks remaining, with all other blocks at zero. This indicates that the methods were applied correctly, but we need to determine the final synthesized block based on the remaining blocks.\n\nLet's analyze the result:\n\n- We have 4 {A} blocks and 3 [B] blocks.\n- No further combinations can be made with the remaining blocks according to the given methods.\n\nSince the problem asks for the synthesized block, we need to consider the final state of the blocks after all possible combinations have been made. The synthesized block is essentially the final configuration of blocks that cannot be further combined.\n\nGiven the final state from the code execution, the synthesized block configuration is:\n\n- 4 {A}\n- 3 [B]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4 {A}, 3 [B]>>>"
