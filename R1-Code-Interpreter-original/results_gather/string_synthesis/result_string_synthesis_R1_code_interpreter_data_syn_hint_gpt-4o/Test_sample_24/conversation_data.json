    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 3 [A], 1 [B], and 6 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 3 [A], 1 [B], and 6 [C]. We can apply this method once, resulting in:\n     - 2 [A], 0 [B], 5 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 2 [A] and 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 0 [B] and 5 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 5 [C], so we can apply this method twice, resulting in:\n     - 2 [C] and 2 {C}.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 2 {C}, so we can apply this method once, resulting in:\n     - 1 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: We have 2 [A], 0 [B], and 2 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n- **Method 2**: We have 2 [A] and 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n- **Method 3**: We have 0 [B] and 2 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n- **Method 4**: We have 2 [C], so we can apply this method once more, resulting in:\n  - 1 {C}.\n\n- **Method 5**: We have 0 {A} and 2 {C}, so we cannot apply this method.\n- **Method 6**: We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\nAfter applying all possible methods, we end up with:\n- 2 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 1 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\nThe synthesized blocks are 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n\n<<<1 (A) and 1 (B)>>>"
