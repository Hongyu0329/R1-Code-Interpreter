    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We will repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 4 [A], 7 [B], and 3 [C].\n\n2. **Method 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n3. **Method 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n4. **Method 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n5. **Method 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n6. **Method 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n7. **Method 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n\nWe will implement this process in Python to simulate the combinations and determine the final number of each type of block.\n\n```python\n# Initial counts of blocks\nA = 4\nB = 7\nC = 3\nA_curly = 0\nB_curly = 0\nC_curly = 0\nA_paren = 0\nB_paren = 0\nC_paren = 0\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods():\n    global A, B, C, A_curly, B_curly, C_curly, A_paren, B_paren, C_paren\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        while A > 0 and B > 0 and C > 0:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            A_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        while A > 0 and B > 0:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        while B > 0 and C > 0:\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            B_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        while C > 1:\n            C -= 2\n            C_curly += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        while A_curly > 0 and C_curly > 0:\n            A_curly -= 1\n            C_curly -= 1\n            A_paren += 1\n            B_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        while B_curly > 1:\n            B_curly -= 2\n            C_paren += 1\n            changes = True\n\napply_methods()\n\n# Output the final counts of each type of block\nprint(f\"[A]: {A}, [B]: {B}, [C]: {C}, {{A}}: {A_curly}, {{B}}: {B_curly}, {{C}}: {C_curly}, (A): {A_paren}, (B): {B_paren}, (C): {C_paren}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final counts of each type of block.",
