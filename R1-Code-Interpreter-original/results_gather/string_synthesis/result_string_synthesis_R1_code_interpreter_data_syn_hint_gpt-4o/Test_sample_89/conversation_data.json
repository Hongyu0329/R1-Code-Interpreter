    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 1 [A], 8 [B], and 2 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 1 [A], 8 [B], and 2 [C]. We can apply this method once, resulting in:\n     - 0 [A], 7 [B], 1 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [A], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 7 [B] and 1 [C]. We can apply this method once, resulting in:\n     - 6 [B], 0 [C], and 1 {B}.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [C], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 0 {C}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 1 {B}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: We have 0 [A], so this method cannot be applied.\n- **Method 2**: We have 0 [A], so this method cannot be applied.\n- **Method 3**: We have 6 [B] and 0 [C], so this method cannot be applied.\n- **Method 4**: We have 0 [C], so this method cannot be applied.\n- **Method 5**: We have 1 {A} and 0 {C}, so this method cannot be applied.\n- **Method 6**: We have 1 {B}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\nNo more methods can be applied, so we have reached a stable state. The final blocks are:\n\n- 0 [A]\n- 6 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 1 {A}\n- 1 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 0 (A)\n- 0 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is a combination of these remaining blocks.\n\n<<<\"0 [A], 6 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)\">>>"
