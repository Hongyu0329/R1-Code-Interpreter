    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 3 [A], 1 [B], and 2 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 3 [A], 1 [B], and 2 [C]. We can apply this method once, using 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n   - Remaining: 2 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 0 {C}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state. The final blocks are:\n\n- 2 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 1 {A}\n\nThe synthesized block is 1 {A}.\n\n<<<1 {A}>>>"
