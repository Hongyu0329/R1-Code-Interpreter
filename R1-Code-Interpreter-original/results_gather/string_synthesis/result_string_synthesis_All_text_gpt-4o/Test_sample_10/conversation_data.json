    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 5 [A]\n- 2 [B]\n- 4 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 4**\n- Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 4 [C], so we can apply this method twice.\n- After applying, we have 0 [C] and 2 {C}.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 2**\n- One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 5 [A] and 2 [B], so we can apply this method twice.\n- After applying, we have 3 [A], 0 [B], and 4 {C}.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 5**\n- One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We have 0 {A} and 4 {C}, so we cannot apply this method yet.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 6**\n- Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Method 1**\n- One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We have 3 [A], 0 [B], and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 6: Apply Method 3**\n- One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n- We have 0 [B] and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. Let's summarize the final blocks:\n\n- 3 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 4 {C}\n- 0 (A)\n- 0 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 4 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 4 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
