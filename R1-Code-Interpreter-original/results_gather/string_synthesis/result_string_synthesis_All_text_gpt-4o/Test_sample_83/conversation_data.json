    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- 1 [A]\n- 6 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n\n**Method Application:**\n\n1. **Method 3:** One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - Use 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n   - New state: 1 [A], 5 [B], 0 [C], 1 {B}\n\n2. **Method 4:** Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Not applicable as we have 0 [C].\n\n3. **Method 2:** One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - New state: 0 [A], 4 [B], 1 {C}, 1 {B}\n\n4. **Method 3:** One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - Use 1 [B] and 1 {C} to form 1 {B}.\n   - New state: 0 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 2 {B}\n\n5. **Method 6:** Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - Use 2 {B} to form 1 (C).\n   - New state: 0 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 0 {B}, 1 (C)\n\n6. **Method 1:** One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - Not applicable as we have 0 [A] and 0 [C].\n\n7. **Method 5:** One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Not applicable as we have 0 {A} and 0 {C}.\n\n8. **Method 4:** Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Not applicable as we have 0 [C].\n\n9. **Method 2:** One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Not applicable as we have 0 [A].\n\n10. **Method 3:** One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n    - Not applicable as we have 0 [C].\n\n11. **Method 6:** Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n    - Not applicable as we have 0 {B}.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. The final state is:\n- 0 [A]\n- 3 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 0 (A)\n- 0 (B)\n- 1 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is 1 (C).\n\nYour answer: <<<1 (C)>>>"
