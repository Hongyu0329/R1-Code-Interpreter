    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - [A]: 3\n   - [B]: 5\n   - [C]: 7\n   - {A}: 0\n   - {B}: 0\n   - {C}: 0\n   - (A): 0\n   - (B): 0\n   - (C): 0\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can do this 3 times (limited by the number of [A]).\n   - New state:\n     - [A]: 0\n     - [B]: 2\n     - [C]: 4\n     - {A}: 3\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We can do this 2 times (limited by the number of [B]).\n   - New state:\n     - [A]: 0\n     - [B]: 0\n     - [C]: 2\n     - {A}: 3\n     - {B}: 2\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We can do this 1 time.\n   - New state:\n     - [A]: 0\n     - [B]: 0\n     - [C]: 0\n     - {A}: 3\n     - {B}: 2\n     - {C}: 1\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can do this 1 time.\n   - New state:\n     - [A]: 0\n     - [B]: 0\n     - [C]: 0\n     - {A}: 2\n     - {B}: 2\n     - {C}: 0\n     - (A): 1\n     - (B): 1\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We can do this 1 time.\n   - New state:\n     - [A]: 0\n     - [B]: 0\n     - [C]: 0\n     - {A}: 2\n     - {B}: 0\n     - {C}: 0\n     - (A): 1\n     - (B): 1\n     - (C): 1\n\n8. **Cycle through Methods again:**\n   - Methods 1, 2, 3, and 4 cannot be applied because we have no [A], [B], or [C].\n   - Method 5 cannot be applied because we have no {C}.\n   - Method 6 cannot be applied because we have less than two {B}.\n\nSince no more changes can be made, we have reached the final state.\n\n**Final State:**\n- [A]: 0\n- [B]: 0\n- [C]: 0\n- {A}: 2\n- {B}: 0\n- {C}: 0\n- (A): 1\n- (B): 1\n- (C): 1\n\nYour answer: <<<2{A},0{B},0{C},1(A),1(B),1(C)>>>"
