    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - 5 [A], 7 [B], 3 [C]\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 3 times (limited by the number of [C] blocks).\n   - After applying Method 1 three times:\n     - 5 - 3 = 2 [A]\n     - 7 - 3 = 4 [B]\n     - 3 - 3 = 0 [C]\n     - 3 {A}\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of [A] blocks).\n   - After applying Method 2 two times:\n     - 2 - 2 = 0 [A]\n     - 4 - 2 = 2 [B]\n     - 0 + 2 = 2 {C}\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of {C} blocks).\n   - After applying Method 5 two times:\n     - 3 - 2 = 1 {A}\n     - 2 - 2 = 0 {C}\n     - 2 (A)\n     - 2 (B)\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\n8. **Final State:**\n   - 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C]\n   - 1 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}\n   - 2 (A), 2 (B), 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized blocks are:\n- 0 [A]\n- 2 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 1 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 2 (A)\n- 2 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 2 (A), 2 (B), 0 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 2 (A), 2 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
