    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 3 [A]\n- 4 [B]\n- 6 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 1**\n- Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We can apply this method 3 times (limited by the number of [A] we have).\n- After applying Method 1 three times, we have:\n  - 0 [A] (3 - 3)\n  - 1 [B] (4 - 3)\n  - 3 [C] (6 - 3)\n  - 3 {A} (0 + 3)\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 2**\n- Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 3**\n- Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n- We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of [B] we have).\n- After applying Method 3 once, we have:\n  - 0 [B] (1 - 1)\n  - 2 [C] (3 - 1)\n  - 1 {B} (0 + 1)\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 4**\n- Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of [C] we have).\n- After applying Method 4 once, we have:\n  - 0 [C] (2 - 2)\n  - 1 {C} (0 + 1)\n\n**Step 5: Apply Method 5**\n- Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of {C} we have).\n- After applying Method 5 once, we have:\n  - 2 {A} (3 - 1)\n  - 0 {C} (1 - 1)\n  - 1 (A) (0 + 1)\n  - 1 (B) (0 + 1)\n\n**Step 6: Apply Method 6**\n- Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We cannot apply this method because we have 1 {B}.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- Method 1: Cannot apply (0 [A]).\n- Method 2: Cannot apply (0 [A]).\n- Method 3: Cannot apply (0 [B]).\n- Method 4: Cannot apply (0 [C]).\n- Method 5: Can apply 2 times (2 {A} and 0 {C}).\n- Method 6: Cannot apply (1 {B}).\n\nSince we cannot apply any more methods, we have reached a stable state.\n\nFinal blocks:\n- 0 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 2 {A}\n- 1 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<2{A}1{B}1(A)1(B)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<2{A}1{B}1(A)1(B)>>>"
