    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial quantities of blocks: 5 [A], 4 [B], and 4 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once with the initial blocks: 5 [A], 4 [B], 4 [C].\n   - After applying, we have: 4 [A], 3 [B], 3 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once: 4 [A], 3 [B], 3 [C].\n   - After applying, we have: 3 [A], 2 [B], 3 [C], and 1 {A}, 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method twice: 3 [A], 2 [B], 3 [C].\n   - After applying twice, we have: 3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], and 1 {A}, 1 {C}, 2 {B}.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have only 1 [C].\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once: 1 {A}, 1 {C}.\n   - After applying, we have: 3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 2 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method once: 2 {B}.\n   - After applying, we have: 3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 0 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 1 (C).\n\nNow, we cycle through the methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Cannot be applied (no [B]).\n- **Method 2**: Cannot be applied (no [B]).\n- **Method 3**: Cannot be applied (no [B]).\n- **Method 4**: Cannot be applied (only 1 [C]).\n- **Method 5**: Cannot be applied (no {A} or {C}).\n- **Method 6**: Cannot be applied (no {B}).\n\nNo more changes can be made. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 3 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {C}\n- 0 {B}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 1 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is: <<<3[A],0[B],1[C],0{A},0{C},0{B},1(A),1(B),1(C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<3[A],0[B],1[C],0{A},0{C},0{B},1(A),1(B),1(C)>>>"
