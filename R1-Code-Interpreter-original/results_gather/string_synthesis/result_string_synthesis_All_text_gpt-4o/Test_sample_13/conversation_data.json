    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 5 [A], 2 [B], 7 [C]\n\n2. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 7 [C], so we can apply this method 3 times (using 6 [C] to form 3 {C}).\n   - Remaining blocks: 5 [A], 2 [B], 1 [C], 3 {C}\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 5 [A] and 2 [B], so we can apply this method 2 times (using 2 [A] and 2 [B] to form 2 {C}).\n   - Remaining blocks: 3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 5 {C}\n\n4. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 3 [A], 0 [B], and 1 [C], so we cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n5. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 0 [B] and 1 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 0 {A} and 5 {C}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state.\n\n**Final Blocks:**\n- 3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 5 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 5 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 5 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
