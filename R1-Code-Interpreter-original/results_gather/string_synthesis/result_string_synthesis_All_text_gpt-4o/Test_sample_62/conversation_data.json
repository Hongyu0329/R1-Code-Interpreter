    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 2 [A], 3 [B], 7 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 7 [C], so we can apply this method 3 times (using 6 [C] to form 3 {C}).\n   - Remaining blocks: 2 [A], 3 [B], 1 [C], 3 {C}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 2 [A] and 3 [B], so we can apply this method 2 times (using 2 [A] and 2 [B] to form 2 {C}).\n   - Remaining blocks: 0 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C], 5 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 1 [B] and 1 [C], so we can apply this method 1 time (using 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}).\n   - Remaining blocks: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 5 {C}, 1 {B}\n\n5. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 1 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 0 {A}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 0 [A], 0 [B], and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached the final state.\n\n**Final Blocks:**\n- 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 5 {C}, 1 {B}\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 5 {C}, 1 {B}>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 5 {C}, 1 {B}>>>"
