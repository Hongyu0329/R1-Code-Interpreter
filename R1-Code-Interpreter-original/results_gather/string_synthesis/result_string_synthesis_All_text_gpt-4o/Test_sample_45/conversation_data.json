    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 4 [A]\n- 2 [B]\n- 2 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 1**\n- Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We can apply this method once because we have at least one of each [A], [B], and [C].\n- After applying Method 1 once, we have:\n  - 3 [A] (4 - 1)\n  - 1 [B] (2 - 1)\n  - 1 [C] (2 - 1)\n  - 1 {A}\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 2**\n- Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We can apply this method once because we have at least one [A] and one [B].\n- After applying Method 2 once, we have:\n  - 2 [A] (3 - 1)\n  - 0 [B] (1 - 1)\n  - 1 [C]\n  - 1 {A}\n  - 1 {C}\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 3**\n- Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n- We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 4**\n- Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We cannot apply this method because we have only 1 [C].\n\n**Step 5: Apply Method 5**\n- Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We can apply this method once because we have at least one {A} and one {C}.\n- After applying Method 5 once, we have:\n  - 2 [A]\n  - 0 [B]\n  - 1 [C]\n  - 0 {A} (1 - 1)\n  - 0 {C} (1 - 1)\n  - 1 (A)\n  - 1 (B)\n\n**Step 6: Apply Method 6**\n- Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any method again:\n\n- Method 1: Cannot apply because we have 0 [B].\n- Method 2: Cannot apply because we have 0 [B].\n- Method 3: Cannot apply because we have 0 [B].\n- Method 4: Cannot apply because we have only 1 [C].\n- Method 5: Cannot apply because we have 0 {A} and 0 {C}.\n- Method 6: Cannot apply because we have 0 {B}.\n\nNo more methods can be applied. The final blocks are:\n- 2 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<2[A], 0[B], 1[C], 0{A}, 0{B}, 0{C}, 1(A), 1(B), 0(C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<2[A], 0[B], 1[C], 0{A}, 0{B}, 0{C], 1(A), 1(B), 0(C)>>>"
