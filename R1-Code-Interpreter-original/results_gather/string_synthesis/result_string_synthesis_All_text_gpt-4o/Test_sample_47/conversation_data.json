    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with 4 [A], 4 [B], and 4 [C]. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 4 times (since we have 4 of each block), resulting in 4 {A} and reducing the count of [A], [B], and [C] to 0.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A] and 0 [B] left.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B] and 0 [C] left.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C] left.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nAfter applying Method 1 four times, we have:\n- 4 {A}\n- 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C]\n- 0 {B}, 0 {C}\n- 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)\n\nSince no other methods can be applied, the final synthesized block is 4 {A}.\n\nYour answer: <<<4 {A}>>>"
