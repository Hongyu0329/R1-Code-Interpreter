    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 5 [A], 7 [B], 5 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 5 times (limited by the number of [A] and [C]).\n   - After 5 applications, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], and 5 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state.\n\n**Final Blocks:**\n- 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 5 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 5 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 5 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
