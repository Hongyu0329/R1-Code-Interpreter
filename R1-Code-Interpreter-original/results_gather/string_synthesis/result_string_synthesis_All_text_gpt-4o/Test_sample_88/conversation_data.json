    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n**Initial Blocks:**\n- 1 [A]\n- 5 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n\n**Method Application:**\n\n1. **Method 3:** One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - Apply this method once: \n     - Use 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n     - Remaining blocks: 1 [A], 4 [B], 0 [C], 1 {B}.\n\n2. **Method 4:** Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Cannot apply this method as there are no [C] blocks left.\n\n3. **Method 2:** One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Apply this method once:\n     - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n     - Remaining blocks: 0 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 1 {B}, 1 {C}.\n\n4. **Method 6:** Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - Cannot apply this method as there is only 1 {B} block.\n\n5. **Method 5:** One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Cannot apply this method as there is no {A} block.\n\n6. **Method 1:** One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - Cannot apply this method as there are no [A] or [C] blocks.\n\n**Cycle through the methods again:**\n\n- **Method 3:** Cannot apply as there are no [C] blocks.\n- **Method 4:** Cannot apply as there are no [C] blocks.\n- **Method 2:** Cannot apply as there are no [A] blocks.\n- **Method 6:** Cannot apply as there is only 1 {B} block.\n- **Method 5:** Cannot apply as there is no {A} block.\n- **Method 1:** Cannot apply as there are no [A] or [C] blocks.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state.\n\n**Final Blocks:**\n- 0 [A]\n- 3 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 1 {B}\n- 1 {C}\n\nThe synthesized block is a combination of the remaining blocks.\n\nYour answer: <<<3[B]1{B}1{C}>>>"
