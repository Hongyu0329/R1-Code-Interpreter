    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C].\n\n2. **Apply Method 1**: \n   - Combine 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n   - New state: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Apply Method 5**: \n   - Combine 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n   - However, we don't have any [C] left to form {C}, so we can't apply this method yet.\n\n4. **Apply Method 2**: \n   - We can't apply this method because we don't have any [A] or [B] left.\n\n5. **Apply Method 3**: \n   - We can't apply this method because we don't have any [B] or [C] left.\n\n6. **Apply Method 4**: \n   - We can't apply this method because we don't have any [C] left.\n\n7. **Apply Method 6**: \n   - We can't apply this method because we don't have any {B}.\n\nSince we can't apply any more methods, we stop here.\n\nThe final synthesized block is 1 {A}.\n\nYour answer: <<<1 {A}>>>"
