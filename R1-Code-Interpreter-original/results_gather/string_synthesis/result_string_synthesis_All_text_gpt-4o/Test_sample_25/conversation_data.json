    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 4 [A]\n- 3 [B]\n- 5 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 1**\n- Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We can apply this method 3 times (limited by the number of [B] blocks).\n- After applying Method 1 three times, we have:\n  - 1 [A] (4 - 3)\n  - 0 [B] (3 - 3)\n  - 2 [C] (5 - 3)\n  - 3 {A} (0 + 3)\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 4**\n- Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of [C] blocks).\n- After applying Method 4 once, we have:\n  - 1 [A]\n  - 0 [B]\n  - 0 [C] (2 - 2)\n  - 3 {A}\n  - 1 {C} (0 + 1)\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 5**\n- Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of {C} blocks).\n- After applying Method 5 once, we have:\n  - 1 [A]\n  - 0 [B]\n  - 0 [C]\n  - 2 {A} (3 - 1)\n  - 0 {C} (1 - 1)\n  - 1 (A) (0 + 1)\n  - 1 (B) (0 + 1)\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 6**\n- Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B} blocks.\n\n**Step 5: Check for other applicable methods**\n- Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n  - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B] blocks.\n- Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n  - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B] and 0 [C] blocks.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached the final state.\n\nFinal blocks:\n- 1 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 2 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is a combination of all the remaining blocks.\n\nYour answer: <<<1[A]0[B]0[C]2{A}0{B}0{C}1(A)1(B)0(C)>>>"
