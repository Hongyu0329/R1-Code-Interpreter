    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 3 [A], 6 [B], 2 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Use 2 [C] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Remaining: 3 [A], 6 [B], 0 [C], 1 {C}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Remaining: 2 [A], 5 [B], 1 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - Use 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 {C} to form 1 {A}.\n   - Remaining: 1 [A], 4 [B], 0 {C}, 1 {A}\n\n5. **Apply Method 2 again:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 3 [B], 1 {C}\n\n6. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - Use 1 [B] and 1 {C} to form 1 {B}.\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 3 [B], 0 {C}, 1 {A}\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - Use 2 {B} to form 1 (C).\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 1 [B], 0 {C}, 1 {A}, 1 (C)\n\n8. **No more methods can be applied:**\n   - We cannot apply any more methods as we do not have the required blocks to satisfy any of the conditions.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are:\n- 0 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 1 (C)\n\nYour answer: <<<1[B]1{A}1(C)>>>"
