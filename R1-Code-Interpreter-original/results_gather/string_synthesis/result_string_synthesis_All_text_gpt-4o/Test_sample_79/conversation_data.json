    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 5 [A], 5 [B], 7 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can do this 5 times (limited by the number of [A] and [B]).\n   - After 5 applications:\n     - 0 [A], 0 [B], 2 [C], 5 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We can do this once (since we have 2 [C]).\n   - After 1 application:\n     - 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 5 {A}, 1 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can do this once (since we have 1 {C}).\n   - After 1 application:\n     - 4 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\n5. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have no {B}.\n\n6. **No more methods can be applied:**\n   - We have 4 {A}, 1 (A), 1 (B), and no other blocks that can be combined further.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are:\n- 4 {A}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nYour answer: <<<4{A}1(A)1(B)>>>"
