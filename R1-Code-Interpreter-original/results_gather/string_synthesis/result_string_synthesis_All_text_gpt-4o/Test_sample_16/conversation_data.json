    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 4 [A], 2 [B], and 2 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method twice because we have 2 [B] and 2 [C].\n   - After applying Method 1 twice, we have:\n     - 2 [A] (4 - 2)\n     - 0 [B] (2 - 2)\n     - 0 [C] (2 - 2)\n     - 2 {A} (0 + 2)\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B] and 0 [C].\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state.\n\n**Final Count:**\n- 2 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 2 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 0 (A)\n- 0 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the final count of each type of block.\n\nYour answer: <<<2 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 2 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
