    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 4 [A], 1 [B], 3 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 3 [C], so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 4 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C], and 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 4 [A] and 1 [B], so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], and 2 {C}.\n\n4. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We don't have any {A} yet, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We don't have any {B} yet, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We don't have any [B] left, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We don't have any [B] left, so we cannot apply this method.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. Let's summarize the final blocks:\n\n- 3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {C}\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the final count of each type of block.\n\nYour answer: <<<3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {C]>>>"
