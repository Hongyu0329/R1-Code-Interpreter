    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 5 [A]\n- 5 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n\nLet's apply the methods:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 5 [A], 5 [B], and 1 [C]. We can apply this method once.\n   - After applying: 4 [A], 4 [B], 0 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 4 [A] and 4 [B]. We can apply this method four times.\n   - After applying: 0 [A], 0 [B], 4 {C}.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 0 [B] and 0 [C]. We cannot apply this method.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [C]. We cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 4 {C}. We can apply this method once.\n   - After applying: 0 {A}, 3 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}. We cannot apply this method.\n\nNow, let's cycle through the methods again:\n\n1. **Method 1**: We have 0 [A], 0 [B], and 0 [C]. We cannot apply this method.\n\n2. **Method 2**: We have 0 [A] and 0 [B]. We cannot apply this method.\n\n3. **Method 3**: We have 0 [B] and 0 [C]. We cannot apply this method.\n\n4. **Method 4**: We have 0 [C]. We cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Method 5**: We have 0 {A} and 3 {C}. We cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Method 6**: We have 0 {B}. We cannot apply this method.\n\nNo more changes can be made. The final synthesized blocks are:\n- 0 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 3 {C}\n- 0 {B}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,0>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,0>>>"
