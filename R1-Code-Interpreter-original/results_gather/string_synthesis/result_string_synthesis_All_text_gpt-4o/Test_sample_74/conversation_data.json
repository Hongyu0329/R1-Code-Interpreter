    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 1 [A], 3 [B], and 7 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 7 [C], so we can apply this method 3 times (using 6 [C] to form 3 {C}).\n   - Remaining blocks: 1 [A], 3 [B], 1 [C], 3 {C}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 3 [B] and 1 [C], so we can apply this method once.\n   - Remaining blocks: 1 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 3 {C}, 1 {B}.\n\n4. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [A] and 2 [B], so we can apply this method once.\n   - Remaining blocks: 0 [A], 1 [B], 1 {C}, 3 {C}, 1 {B}.\n\n5. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 1 {B}, so we cannot apply this method yet.\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 0 {A}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 0 [A], 1 [B], and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n8. **Re-evaluate:**\n   - We have 0 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 1 {C}, 3 {C}, 1 {B}.\n   - We cannot apply any more methods as we do not have the required blocks for any method.\n\n9. **Final Count:**\n   - [A]: 0\n   - [B]: 1\n   - [C]: 0\n   - {A}: 0\n   - {B}: 1\n   - {C}: 4\n   - (A): 0\n   - (B): 0\n   - (C): 0\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0,1,0,0,1,4,0,0,0>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0,1,0,0,1,4,0,0,0>>>"
