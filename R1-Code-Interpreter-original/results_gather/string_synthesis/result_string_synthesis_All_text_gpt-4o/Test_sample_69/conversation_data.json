    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 3 [A], 6 [B], and 3 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 3 times (since we have 3 [A], 6 [B], and 3 [C]).\n   - After applying this method 3 times, we have 0 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], and 3 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state. The final blocks are:\n\n- 0 [A]\n- 3 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 3 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 0 (A)\n- 0 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the number of each type of block in the order: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n\nYour answer: <<<0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0>>>"
