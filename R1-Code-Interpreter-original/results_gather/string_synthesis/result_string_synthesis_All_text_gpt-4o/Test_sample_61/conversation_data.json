    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 4 [A]\n- 1 [B]\n- 5 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 4**\n- Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 5 [C], so we can apply this method twice:\n  - Use 4 [C] to form 2 {C}.\n  - Remaining: 1 [C].\n\n**Current blocks:**\n- 4 [A]\n- 1 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 2 {C}\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 2**\n- One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 4 [A] and 1 [B], so we can apply this method once:\n  - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n  - Remaining: 3 [A], 0 [B].\n\n**Current blocks:**\n- 3 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 3 {C}\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 4 again**\n- Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 1 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 5**\n- One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We have 0 {A} and 3 {C}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Method 6**\n- Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 6: Apply Method 1**\n- One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We have 3 [A], 0 [B], and 1 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. Therefore, the final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 3 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 3 {C}\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 3 {C}>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<3 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 3 {C}>>>"
