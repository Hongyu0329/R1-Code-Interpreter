    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial quantities of blocks: 5 [A], 3 [B], and 7 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 3 times (limited by the number of [B] blocks).\n   - After applying this method 3 times, we have:\n     - [A]: 5 - 3 = 2\n     - [B]: 3 - 3 = 0\n     - [C]: 7 - 3 = 4\n     - {A}: 0 + 3 = 3\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B] blocks left.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B] blocks left.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of [C] blocks).\n   - After applying this method 2 times, we have:\n     - [C]: 4 - 4 = 0\n     - {C}: 0 + 2 = 2\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of {C} blocks).\n   - After applying this method 2 times, we have:\n     - {A}: 3 - 2 = 1\n     - {C}: 2 - 2 = 0\n     - (A): 0 + 2 = 2\n     - (B): 0 + 2 = 2\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B} blocks.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Cannot be applied (0 [B] blocks).\n- **Method 2**: Cannot be applied (0 [B] blocks).\n- **Method 3**: Cannot be applied (0 [B] blocks).\n- **Method 4**: Cannot be applied (0 [C] blocks).\n- **Method 5**: Cannot be applied (0 {C} blocks).\n- **Method 6**: Cannot be applied (0 {B} blocks).\n\nNo more methods can be applied, so we have reached a stable state. The final quantities of blocks are:\n\n- [A]: 2\n- [B]: 0\n- [C]: 0\n- {A}: 1\n- {B}: 0\n- {C}: 0\n- (A): 2\n- (B): 2\n- (C): 0\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the final quantities of each type of block.\n\nYour answer: <<<2 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 2 (A), 2 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
