    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with 5 [A], 5 [B], and 5 [C]. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - [A]: 5\n   - [B]: 5\n   - [C]: 5\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 5 times (since we have 5 of each block).\n   - After applying:\n     - [A]: 0\n     - [B]: 0\n     - [C]: 0\n     - {A}: 5\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have no [A] or [B] left, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have no [B] or [C] left, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have no [C] left, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 5 {A} but no {C}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have no {B}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- [A]: 0\n- [B]: 0\n- [C]: 0\n- {A}: 5\n- {B}: 0\n- {C}: 0\n- (A): 0\n- (B): 0\n- (C): 0\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<5{A}>>>"
