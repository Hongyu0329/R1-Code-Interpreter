    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 5 [A]\n- 1 [B]\n- 3 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 4**\n- Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 3 [C], so we can apply this method once.\n- After applying, we have 1 [C] left and gain 1 {C}.\n\nCurrent blocks:\n- 5 [A]\n- 1 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 1 {C}\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 2**\n- Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 5 [A] and 1 [B], so we can apply this method once.\n- After applying, we have 4 [A], 0 [B], and gain another {C}.\n\nCurrent blocks:\n- 4 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 2 {C}\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 5**\n- Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We don't have any {A}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 6**\n- Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We don't have any {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Method 1**\n- Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We don't have any [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 6: Apply Method 3**\n- Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n- We don't have any [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied because we lack the necessary blocks to satisfy the conditions of any method. Therefore, we have reached a stable state.\n\nFinal blocks:\n- 4 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 2 {C}\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the final count of each type of block.\n\nYour answer: <<<4 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {C]>>>"
