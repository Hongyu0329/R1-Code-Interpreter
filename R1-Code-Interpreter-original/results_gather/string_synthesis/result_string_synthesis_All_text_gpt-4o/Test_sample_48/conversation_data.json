    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 3 [A], 6 [B], and 7 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 3 times (since we have 3 [A]).\n   - After applying, we have 0 [A], 3 [B], 4 [C], and 3 {A}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method 3 times (since we have 3 [B] and 4 [C]).\n   - After applying, we have 0 [B], 1 [C], and 3 {B}.\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have only 1 [C].\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method once (since we have 3 {B}).\n   - After applying, we have 1 {B} and 1 (C).\n\n8. **Re-evaluate:**\n   - We have 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 3 {A}, 1 {B}, and 1 (C).\n   - No more methods can be applied because we don't have the required blocks for any method.\n\n9. **Final Count:**\n   - [A]: 0\n   - [B]: 0\n   - [C]: 1\n   - {A}: 3\n   - {B}: 1\n   - {C}: 0\n   - (A): 0\n   - (B): 0\n   - (C): 1\n\nThe final synthesized block is:\n<<<0,0,1,3,1,0,0,0,1>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0,0,1,3,1,0,0,0,1>>>"
