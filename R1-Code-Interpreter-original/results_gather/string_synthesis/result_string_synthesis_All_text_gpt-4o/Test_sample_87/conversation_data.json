    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - 5 [A], 3 [B], 3 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - Combine 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n   - New state: 4 [A], 2 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - Combine 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - New state: 3 [A], 1 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - Combine 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n   - New state: 3 [A], 1 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}, 1 {B}\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Combine 2 [C] to form 1 {C}.\n   - New state: 3 [A], 1 {A}, 2 {C}, 1 {B}\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - Combine 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n   - New state: 3 [A], 1 {C}, 1 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Not applicable as we only have 1 {B}.\n\n8. **Cycle through Methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Not applicable as we don't have enough [B] and [C].\n   - **Method 2:** Not applicable as we don't have enough [B].\n   - **Method 3:** Not applicable as we don't have enough [B].\n   - **Method 4:** Not applicable as we don't have enough [C].\n   - **Method 5:** Combine 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n     - New state: 3 [A], 1 {B}, 2 (A), 2 (B)\n   - **Method 6:** Not applicable as we only have 1 {B}.\n\n9. **Cycle through Methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Not applicable as we don't have enough [B] and [C].\n   - **Method 2:** Not applicable as we don't have enough [B].\n   - **Method 3:** Not applicable as we don't have enough [B].\n   - **Method 4:** Not applicable as we don't have enough [C].\n   - **Method 5:** Not applicable as we don't have enough {C}.\n   - **Method 6:** Not applicable as we don't have enough {B}.\n\n10. **Final State:**\n    - 3 [A], 1 {B}, 2 (A), 2 (B)\n\nNo more changes can be made. Therefore, the synthesized blocks are:\n\nYour answer: <<<3[A],1{B},2(A),2(B)>>>"
