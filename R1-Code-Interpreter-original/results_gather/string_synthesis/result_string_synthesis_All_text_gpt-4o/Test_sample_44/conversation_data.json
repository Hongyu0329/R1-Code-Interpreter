    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 5 [A], 7 [B], and 2 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 2 [C], so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 0 [C] and 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 5 [A] and 7 [B], so we can apply this method 5 times.\n   - After applying, we have 0 [A], 2 [B], and 5 {C}.\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 2 [B] and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 0 {A} and 5 {C}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 0 [A], 2 [B], and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state.\n\n**Final Count:**\n- [A]: 0\n- [B]: 2\n- [C]: 0\n- {A}: 0\n- {B}: 0\n- {C}: 5\n- (A): 0\n- (B): 0\n- (C): 0\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the final count of each type of block.\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 5 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
