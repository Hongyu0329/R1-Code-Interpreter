    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 1 [A]\n   - 7 [B]\n   - 3 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - Combine 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n   - New count: 0 [A], 6 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - Combine 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Since we have 0 [A], this method cannot be applied.\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - Combine 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n   - New count: 6 [B], 1 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {B}\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Combine 2 [C] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Since we have 1 [C], this method cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - Combine 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n   - Since we have 0 {C}, this method cannot be applied.\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Combine 2 {B} to form 1 (C).\n   - Since we have 1 {B}, this method cannot be applied.\n\n8. **Cycle through the methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Cannot be applied (0 [A]).\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot be applied (0 [A]).\n   - **Method 3:** Combine 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n     - New count: 5 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 2 {B}\n   - **Method 4:** Cannot be applied (0 [C]).\n   - **Method 5:** Cannot be applied (0 {C}).\n   - **Method 6:** Combine 2 {B} to form 1 (C).\n     - New count: 5 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 0 {B}, 1 (C)\n\n9. **Cycle through the methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Cannot be applied (0 [A]).\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot be applied (0 [A]).\n   - **Method 3:** Cannot be applied (0 [C]).\n   - **Method 4:** Cannot be applied (0 [C]).\n   - **Method 5:** Cannot be applied (0 {C}).\n   - **Method 6:** Cannot be applied (0 {B}).\n\nAt this point, no more changes can be made. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 5 [B]\n- 1 {A}\n- 1 (C)\n\nYour answer: <<<5 [B], 1 {A}, 1 (C)>>>"
