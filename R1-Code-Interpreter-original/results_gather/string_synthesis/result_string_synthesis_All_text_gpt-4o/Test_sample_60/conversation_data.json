    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 1 [A], 1 [B], 3 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Use 2 [C] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Remaining: 1 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C], 1 {C}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We don't have any {A}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n5. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We don't have any {B}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We don't have any [B], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n7. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We don't have any [A] or [B], so this method cannot be applied.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. The final blocks are:\n\n- 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {C}\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {C]>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {C]>>>"
