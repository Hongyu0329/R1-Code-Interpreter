    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with 3 [A], 3 [B], and 3 [C]. Let's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - Apply this method once: \n     - Use 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n     - Remaining: 2 [A], 2 [B], 2 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Apply this method once:\n     - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n     - Remaining: 1 [A], 1 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}, and 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - Apply this method once:\n     - Use 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n     - Remaining: 1 [A], 1 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}, and 1 {B}.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we only have 1 [C] left.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Apply this method once:\n     - Use 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n     - Remaining: 1 [A], 1 {B}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we only have 1 {B}.\n\nNow, let's cycle through the methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Cannot be applied because we don't have enough [A], [B], and [C].\n- **Method 2**: Cannot be applied because we don't have enough [A] and [B].\n- **Method 3**: Cannot be applied because we don't have enough [B] and [C].\n- **Method 4**: Cannot be applied because we don't have enough [C].\n- **Method 5**: Cannot be applied because we don't have enough {A} and {C}.\n- **Method 6**: Cannot be applied because we don't have enough {B}.\n\nNo more methods can be applied. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 1 [A]\n- 1 {B}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nYour answer: <<<1 [A], 1 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B)>>>"
