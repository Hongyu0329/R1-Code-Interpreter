    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 3 [A]\n- 1 [B]\n- 7 [C]\n\nLet's apply the methods:\n\n1. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 7 [C], so we can apply this method 3 times (using 6 [C] to form 3 {C}).\n   - Remaining blocks: 3 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C], 3 {C}\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 3 [A] and 1 [B], so we can apply this method once.\n   - Remaining blocks: 2 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 4 {C}\n\n3. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [C], so we cannot apply this method anymore.\n\n4. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 0 {A}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state. The final blocks are:\n- 2 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 4 {C}\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the remaining blocks.\n\nYour answer: <<<2[A], 0[B], 1[C], 4{C}>>>"
