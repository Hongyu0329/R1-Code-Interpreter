    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 3 [A], 1 [B], and 2 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 2 [C], so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 3 [A], 1 [B], and 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 3 [A] and 1 [B], so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 2 [A], 1 {C}, and 1 {C} (total 2 {C}).\n\n4. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We don't have any {A} yet, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We don't have any {B} yet, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We don't have any [B] or [C] left, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We don't have any [B] or [C] left, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n8. **Final State:**\n   - We have 2 [A] and 2 {C}.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, the final synthesized blocks are 2 [A] and 2 {C}.\n\nYour answer: <<<2 [A], 2 {C}>>>"
