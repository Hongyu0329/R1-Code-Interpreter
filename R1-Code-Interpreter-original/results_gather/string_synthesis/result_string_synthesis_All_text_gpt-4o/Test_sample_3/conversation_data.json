    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly to the initial set of blocks until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 5 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Remaining blocks: 4 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 1 {C}\n\n3. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [C] and 1 {C}, so we can't apply this method yet.\n\n4. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We don't have [B] available, so we can't apply this method.\n\n5. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We don't have [B] available, so we can't apply this method.\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We don't have {A} available, so we can't apply this method.\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We don't have {B} available, so we can't apply this method.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state.\n\n**Final Blocks:**\n- 4 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 1 {C}\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the final count of each type of block.\n\nYour answer: <<<4 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 1 {C]>>>"
