    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 2 [A]\n- 5 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 1**\n- Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We have 2 [A], 5 [B], and 1 [C]. We can apply this method once.\n- After applying Method 1 once, we have:\n  - 1 [A] (2 - 1)\n  - 4 [B] (5 - 1)\n  - 0 [C] (1 - 1)\n  - 1 {A}\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 2**\n- Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 1 [A] and 4 [B]. We can apply this method once.\n- After applying Method 2 once, we have:\n  - 0 [A] (1 - 1)\n  - 3 [B] (4 - 1)\n  - 1 {C}\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 3**\n- Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n- We have 3 [B] and 0 [C]. We cannot apply this method because we need at least one [C].\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 4**\n- Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 0 [C]. We cannot apply this method because we need at least two [C].\n\n**Step 5: Apply Method 5**\n- Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We have 1 {A} and 1 {C}. We can apply this method once.\n- After applying Method 5 once, we have:\n  - 0 {A} (1 - 1)\n  - 0 {C} (1 - 1)\n  - 1 (A)\n  - 1 (B)\n\n**Step 6: Apply Method 6**\n- Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We have 0 {B}. We cannot apply this method because we need at least two {B}.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any method again:\n\n- We have 0 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n- None of the methods can be applied again because we do not have the required blocks for any method.\n\nTherefore, the final synthesized blocks are:\n- 3 [B]\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3[B]1(A)1(B)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<3[B]1(A)1(B)>>>"
