    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 4 [A], 1 [B], 3 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - Combine 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n   - New count: 3 [A], 0 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - Combine 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Since we have 0 [B], we cannot apply this method.\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - Combine 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n   - Since we have 0 [B], we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Combine 2 [C] to form 1 {C}.\n   - New count: 3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - Combine 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n   - New count: 3 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Combine 2 {B} to form 1 (C).\n   - Since we have 0 {B}, we cannot apply this method.\n\n8. **Cycle through methods again:**\n   - We cannot apply Method 1 because we have 0 [B].\n   - We cannot apply Method 2 because we have 0 [B].\n   - We cannot apply Method 3 because we have 0 [B].\n   - We cannot apply Method 4 because we have 0 [C].\n   - We cannot apply Method 5 because we have 0 {A} and 0 {C}.\n   - We cannot apply Method 6 because we have 0 {B}.\n\nSince no more changes can be made, we have reached the final state.\n\n**Final Blocks:**\n- 3 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<3[A],1[B],0[C],0{A},0{B},0{C},1(A),1(B),0(C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<3[A],1[B],0[C],0{A},0{B},0{C},1(A),1(B),0(C)>>>"
