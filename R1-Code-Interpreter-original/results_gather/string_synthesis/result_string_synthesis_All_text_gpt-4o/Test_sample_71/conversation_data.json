    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 1 [A], 3 [B], and 3 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 1 [A], 3 [B], and 3 [C]. We can apply Method 1 once:\n     - Use 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n   - Remaining blocks: 0 [A], 2 [B], 2 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [A], so we cannot apply Method 2.\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 2 [B] and 2 [C]. We can apply Method 3 twice:\n     - Use 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n     - Use 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form another {B}.\n   - Remaining blocks: 0 [B], 0 [C], and 1 {A}, 2 {B}.\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [C], so we cannot apply Method 4.\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 0 {C}, so we cannot apply Method 5.\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 2 {B}. We can apply Method 6 once:\n     - Use 2 {B} to form 1 (C).\n   - Remaining blocks: 1 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, and 1 (C).\n\n8. **Re-evaluate:**\n   - We have 1 {A} and 1 (C). No further methods can be applied as we don't have the required blocks for any method.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are 1 {A} and 1 (C).\n\nYour answer: <<<1{A},1(C)>>>"
