    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 1 [A]\n- 8 [B]\n- 2 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 3**\n- Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n- We have 8 [B] and 2 [C], so we can apply this method twice.\n- After applying Method 3 twice, we have:\n  - 6 [B] (8 - 2 = 6)\n  - 0 [C] (2 - 2 = 0)\n  - 2 {B} (0 + 2 = 2)\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 6**\n- Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We have 2 {B}, so we can apply this method once.\n- After applying Method 6, we have:\n  - 0 {B} (2 - 2 = 0)\n  - 1 (C) (0 + 1 = 1)\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 4**\n- Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 2**\n- Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We have 1 [A] and 6 [B], so we can apply this method once.\n- After applying Method 2, we have:\n  - 0 [A] (1 - 1 = 0)\n  - 5 [B] (6 - 1 = 5)\n  - 1 {C} (0 + 1 = 1)\n\n**Step 5: Apply Method 5**\n- Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We have 0 {A} and 1 {C}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n**Step 6: Apply Method 1**\n- Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We have 0 [A], 5 [B], and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. Let's summarize the final blocks:\n- 0 [A]\n- 5 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 1 {C}\n- 0 (A)\n- 0 (B)\n- 1 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0 [A], 5 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 1 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 1 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 5 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 1 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 1 (C)>>>"
