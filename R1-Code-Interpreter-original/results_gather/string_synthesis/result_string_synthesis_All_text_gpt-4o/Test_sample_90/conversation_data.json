    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 3 [A], 3 [B], and 6 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 3 times (since we have 3 of each [A], [B], and [C]).\n   - After applying Method 1 three times, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 0 [B], 3 [C], and 3 {A}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [A] and 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 0 [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 3 [C], so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying Method 4 once, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 1 {C}, and 3 {A}.\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 3 {A} and 1 {C}, so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying Method 5 once, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 0 {C}, 2 {A}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n8. **Re-evaluate:**\n   - We have 2 {A}, 1 (A), 1 (B), and 1 [C].\n   - No further methods can be applied as we do not have the required blocks to satisfy any method.\n\n9. **Final Count:**\n   - [A]: 0\n   - [B]: 0\n   - [C]: 1\n   - {A}: 2\n   - {B}: 0\n   - {C}: 0\n   - (A): 1\n   - (B): 1\n   - (C): 0\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 2 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
