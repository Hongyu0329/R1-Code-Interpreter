    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 1 [A], 7 [B], and 4 [C].\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 1 [A], 7 [B], 4 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method 4 times (since we have 4 [C] and 7 [B]).\n   - After applying 4 times, we have:\n     - 1 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 4 {B}\n\n3. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (since we have 4 {B}).\n   - After applying 2 times, we have:\n     - 1 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 0 {B}, 2 (C)\n\n4. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method 1 time (since we have 1 [A] and 3 [B]).\n   - After applying 1 time, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 1 {C}, 2 (C)\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have 0 {A}.\n\n7. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have 0 [A] and 0 [C].\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 1 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 2 (C)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 1 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 2 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 1 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 2 (C)>>>"
