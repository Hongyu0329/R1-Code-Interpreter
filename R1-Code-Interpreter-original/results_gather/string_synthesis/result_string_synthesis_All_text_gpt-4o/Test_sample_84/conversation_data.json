    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 5 [A], 6 [B], and 6 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 5 times (limited by the number of [A] we have).\n   - After applying Method 1 five times, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C], and 5 {A}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method once (limited by the number of [C] we have).\n   - After applying Method 3 once, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 1 {B}, and 5 {A}.\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 1 {B}.\n\n8. **Final State:**\n   - We have reached a state where no more methods can be applied.\n   - The final blocks are: 0 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 5 {A}, 1 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C).\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 5 {A}, 1 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 5 {A}, 1 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
