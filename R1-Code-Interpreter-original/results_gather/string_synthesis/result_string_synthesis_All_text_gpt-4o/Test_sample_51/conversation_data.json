    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 5 [A], 6 [B], 4 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 4 times (limited by the number of [C] blocks).\n   - After 4 applications, we have:\n     - 1 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], and 4 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of [A] blocks).\n   - After 1 application, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 1 [B], 1 {C}, and 4 {A}\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of [B] and {C} blocks).\n   - After 1 application, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 {C}, 4 {A}, and 1 {B}\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have no [C] blocks left, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have no {C} blocks left, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have only 1 {B} block, so this method cannot be applied.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached the final state.\n\n**Final Blocks:**\n- 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 4 {A}, 1 {B}, 0 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<4{A}1{B}>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<4{A}1{B}>>>"
