    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly to the initial set of blocks until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 2 [A], 4 [B], and 1 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 2 [A], 4 [B], and 1 [C]. We can apply Method 1 once:\n     - Use 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n     - Remaining: 1 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [A] and 3 [B]. We can apply Method 2 once:\n     - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n     - Remaining: 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, and 1 {C}.\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 2 [B] and 0 [C], so we cannot apply Method 3.\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [C], so we cannot apply Method 4.\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 1 {C}. We can apply Method 5 once:\n     - Use 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n     - Remaining: 2 [B], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply Method 6.\n\n8. **Cycle through Methods Again:**\n   - We have 2 [B], 1 (A), and 1 (B). None of the methods can be applied further as they require specific combinations of blocks that we do not have.\n\n9. **Final Result:**\n   - The final synthesized blocks are 2 [B], 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nYour answer: <<<2 [B], 1 (A), 1 (B)>>>"
