    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 2 [A], 3 [B], and 3 [C].\n\nLet's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 2 [A], 3 [B], and 3 [C]. We can apply this method once:\n     - Use 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n     - Remaining: 1 [A], 2 [B], 2 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [A] and 2 [B]. We can apply this method once:\n     - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n     - Remaining: 1 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}, and 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 1 [B] and 2 [C]. We can apply this method once:\n     - Use 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n     - Remaining: 1 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}, and 1 {B}.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 1 {C}. We can apply this method once:\n     - Use 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n     - Remaining: 1 {B}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 1 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- We have 1 {B}, 1 (A), and 1 (B). None of the methods can be applied with these blocks.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached the final state.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are: 1 {B}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\nYour answer: <<<1{B}1(A)1(B)>>>"
