    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- 5 [A]\n- 7 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n\n**Method Application:**\n\n1. **Method 1:** One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 5 [A], 7 [B], and 1 [C]. We can apply this method once.\n   - After applying: 4 [A], 6 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}\n\n2. **Method 2:** One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 4 [A] and 6 [B]. We can apply this method four times.\n   - After applying: 0 [A], 2 [B], 4 {C}\n\n3. **Method 3:** One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 2 [B] and 4 {C}. We can apply this method twice.\n   - After applying: 0 [B], 2 {B}, 2 {C}\n\n4. **Method 4:** Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [C], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n5. **Method 5:** One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 1 {A} and 2 {C}. We can apply this method once.\n   - After applying: 0 {A}, 1 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\n6. **Method 6:** Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 2 {B}. We can apply this method once.\n   - After applying: 0 {B}, 1 (C)\n\n**Final State:**\n- 0 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 1 {C}\n- 0 {B}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 1 (C)\n\nThe synthesized blocks are 1 (A), 1 (B), and 1 (C).\n\nYour answer: <<<1 (A), 1 (B), 1 (C)>>>"
