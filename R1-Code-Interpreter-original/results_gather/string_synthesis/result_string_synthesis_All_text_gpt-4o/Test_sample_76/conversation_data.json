    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - 2 [A], 3 [B], 4 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 4 [C], so we can apply this method twice.\n   - After applying twice: 2 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 2 {C}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 2 [A] and 3 [B], so we can apply this method twice.\n   - After applying twice: 0 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 4 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 0 {A} and 4 {C}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 1 [B] and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 0 [A], 1 [B], and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. The final state of the blocks is:\n\n- 0 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], 4 {C}, 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0>>>"
