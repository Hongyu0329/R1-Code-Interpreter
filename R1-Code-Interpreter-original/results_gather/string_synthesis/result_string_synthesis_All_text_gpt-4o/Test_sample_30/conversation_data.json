    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 1 [A], 1 [B], and 4 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 4 [C], so we can apply this method twice:\n     - First application: 4 [C] -> 2 [C] + 1 {C}\n     - Second application: 2 [C] -> 0 [C] + 2 {C}\n   - Now we have: 1 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], and 2 {C}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [A] and 1 [B], so we can apply this method:\n     - 1 [A] + 1 [B] -> 0 [A] + 0 [B] + 1 {C}\n   - Now we have: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], and 3 {C}.\n\n4. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We don't have any {A}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n5. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We don't have any {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We don't have any [B] or [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We don't have any [A], [B], or [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state.\n\n**Final Count:**\n- 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 3 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C).\n\nThe synthesized block is 3 {C}.\n\nYour answer: <<<3 {C}>>>"
