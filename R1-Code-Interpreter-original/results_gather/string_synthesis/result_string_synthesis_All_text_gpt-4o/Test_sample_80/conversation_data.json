    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 4 [A], 5 [B], 3 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - Combine 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n   - New count: 3 [A], 4 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - Combine 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - New count: 2 [A], 3 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - Combine 1 [B] and 1 [C] to form 1 {B}.\n   - New count: 2 [A], 2 [B], 1 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}, 1 {B}\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Combine 2 [C] to form 1 {C}.\n   - New count: 2 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 2 {C}, 1 {B}\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - Combine 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n   - New count: 2 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 1 {C}, 1 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Combine 2 {B} to form 1 (C).\n   - New count: 2 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 1 {C}, 0 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 1 (C)\n\n8. **Cycle through methods again:**\n   - No more combinations can be made with the remaining blocks.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are:\n- 2 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 1 {C}, 0 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 1 (C)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<2[A]2[B]0[C]0{A}1{C}0{B}1(A)1(B)1(C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<2[A]2[B]0[C]0{A}1{C}0{B}1(A)1(B)1(C)>>>"
