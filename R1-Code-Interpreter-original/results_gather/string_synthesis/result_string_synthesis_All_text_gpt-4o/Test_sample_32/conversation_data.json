    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 5 [A], 5 [B], 3 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can do this 3 times (limited by the number of [C]).\n   - After 3 applications: \n     - Remaining: 2 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C]\n     - New: 3 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We can do this 2 times (limited by the number of [A] and [B]).\n   - After 2 applications:\n     - Remaining: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C]\n     - New: 3 {A}, 2 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - No [B] or [C] left, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - No [C] left, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can do this 2 times (limited by the number of {C}).\n   - After 2 applications:\n     - Remaining: 1 {A}, 0 {C}\n     - New: 2 (A), 2 (B)\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - No {B} left, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n8. **Final Blocks:**\n   - 1 {A}, 2 (A), 2 (B)\n\nNo more methods can be applied as we have exhausted the possibilities with the available blocks.\n\nYour answer: <<<1 {A}, 2 (A), 2 (B)>>>"
