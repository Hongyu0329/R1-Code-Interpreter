    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 5 [A]\n   - 4 [B]\n   - 7 [C]\n\n2. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 4 times (limited by the number of [B] and [C]).\n   - After 4 applications, we have:\n     - 1 [A] (5 - 4)\n     - 0 [B] (4 - 4)\n     - 3 [C] (7 - 4)\n     - 4 {A}\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n4. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [B].\n\n5. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of [C]).\n   - After 1 application, we have:\n     - 1 [A]\n     - 0 [B]\n     - 1 [C] (3 - 2)\n     - 4 {A}\n     - 1 {C}\n\n6. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method 1 time (limited by the number of {C}).\n   - After 1 application, we have:\n     - 1 [A]\n     - 0 [B]\n     - 1 [C]\n     - 3 {A} (4 - 1)\n     - 0 {C} (1 - 1)\n     - 1 (A)\n     - 1 (B)\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {B}.\n\n8. **Cycle through Methods Again:**\n   - Methods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 cannot be applied due to insufficient blocks.\n   - Method 5 cannot be applied because we have 0 {C}.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached a stable state.\n\n**Final Count of Blocks:**\n- 1 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 3 {A}\n- 0 {C}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is represented by the final count of each type of block.\n\nYour answer: <<<1 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 3 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
