    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 2 [A], 8 [B], 6 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method twice (since we have 2 [A]).\n   - After applying twice, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 6 [B], 4 [C], 2 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [A], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method four times (since we have 4 [C]).\n   - After applying four times, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 2 {A}, 4 {B}\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 0 [C], so this method cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 0 {C}, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method twice (since we have 4 {B}).\n   - After applying twice, we have:\n     - 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 2 {A}, 0 {B}, 2 (C)\n\n8. **Re-evaluate:**\n   - We have 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 2 {A}, 0 {B}, 2 (C).\n   - No more methods can be applied as we don't have the required blocks for any method.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are:\n- 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 2 {A}, 0 {B}, 2 (C)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 2 {A}, 0 {B}, 2 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 2 {A}, 0 {B}, 2 (C)>>>"
