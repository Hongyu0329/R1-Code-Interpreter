    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- 5 [A]\n- 2 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n\n**Method Application:**\n\n1. **Method 1:** One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - Apply once: Use 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C].\n   - Result: 4 [A], 1 [B], 0 [C], and gain 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2:** One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Apply once: Use 1 [A] and 1 [B].\n   - Result: 3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], and gain 1 {A} and 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Method 3:** One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - Cannot apply because there are no [B] or [C] left.\n\n4. **Method 4:** Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Cannot apply because there are no [C] left.\n\n5. **Method 5:** One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Apply once: Use 1 {A} and 1 {C}.\n   - Result: 3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, and gain 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6:** Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - Cannot apply because there are no {B}.\n\n**Cycle through the methods again:**\n\n- Methods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 cannot be applied due to lack of necessary blocks.\n- Method 5 cannot be applied again because there are no {A} or {C} left.\n\n**Final State:**\n- 3 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized blocks are: 3 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C).\n\nYour answer: <<<3[A]0[B]0[C]0{A}0{B}0{C}1(A)1(B)0(C)>>>"
