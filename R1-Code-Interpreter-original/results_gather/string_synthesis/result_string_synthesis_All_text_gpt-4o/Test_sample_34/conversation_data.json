    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. We start with the initial blocks: 2 [A], 5 [B], and 4 [C].\n\nLet's go through the methods step by step:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method once with the initial blocks: 2 [A], 5 [B], 4 [C].\n   - After applying, we have: 1 [A], 4 [B], 3 [C], and 1 {A}.\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We can apply this method once: 1 [A], 4 [B], 3 [C].\n   - After applying, we have: 0 [A], 3 [B], 3 [C], 1 {A}, and 1 {C}.\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method three times: 0 [A], 3 [B], 3 [C].\n   - After applying, we have: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}, and 3 {B}.\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method as we have 0 [C].\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We can apply this method once: 1 {A}, 1 {C}.\n   - After applying, we have: 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 3 {B}, 1 (A), and 1 (B).\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method once: 3 {B}.\n   - After applying, we have: 1 {B}, 1 (A), 1 (B), and 1 (C).\n\nNow, let's check if we can apply any methods again:\n\n- **Method 1**: Requires [A], [B], and [C], which we don't have.\n- **Method 2**: Requires [A] and [B], which we don't have.\n- **Method 3**: Requires [B] and [C], which we don't have.\n- **Method 4**: Requires two [C], which we don't have.\n- **Method 5**: Requires {A} and {C}, which we don't have.\n- **Method 6**: Requires two {B}, which we don't have.\n\nNo more methods can be applied. The final blocks are:\n\n- 1 {B}\n- 1 (A)\n- 1 (B)\n- 1 (C)\n\nTherefore, the synthesized block is:\n\nYour answer: <<<1{B}1(A)1(B)1(C)>>>"
