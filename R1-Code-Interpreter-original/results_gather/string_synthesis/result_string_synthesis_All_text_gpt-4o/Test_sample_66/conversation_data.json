    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\nInitial blocks:\n- 4 [A]\n- 7 [B]\n- 2 [C]\n\n**Step 1: Apply Method 1**\n- Method 1: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n- We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of [C] blocks).\n- After applying Method 1 twice, we have:\n  - 2 [A] (4 - 2)\n  - 5 [B] (7 - 2)\n  - 0 [C] (2 - 2)\n  - 2 {A} (0 + 2)\n\n**Step 2: Apply Method 2**\n- Method 2: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of [A] blocks).\n- After applying Method 2 twice, we have:\n  - 0 [A] (2 - 2)\n  - 3 [B] (5 - 2)\n  - 2 {C} (0 + 2)\n\n**Step 3: Apply Method 3**\n- Method 3: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n- We cannot apply this method because we have no [C] blocks.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Method 4**\n- Method 4: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n- We cannot apply this method because we have no [C] blocks.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Method 5**\n- Method 5: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n- We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of {A} blocks).\n- After applying Method 5 twice, we have:\n  - 0 {A} (2 - 2)\n  - 0 {C} (2 - 2)\n  - 2 (A) (0 + 2)\n  - 2 (B) (0 + 2)\n\n**Step 6: Apply Method 6**\n- Method 6: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n- We cannot apply this method because we have no {B} blocks.\n\nAt this point, we have:\n- 0 [A]\n- 3 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 2 (A)\n- 2 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, the final synthesized blocks are:\n- 0 [A]\n- 3 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 0 {C}\n- 2 (A)\n- 2 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 2 (A), 2 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
