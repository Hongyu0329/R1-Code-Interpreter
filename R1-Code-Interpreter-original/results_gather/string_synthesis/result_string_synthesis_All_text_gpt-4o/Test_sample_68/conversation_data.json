    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 2 [A], 4 [B], 1 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - Use 1 [A], 1 [B], and 1 [C] to form 1 {A}.\n   - Remaining: 1 [A], 3 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Use 1 [A] and 1 [B] to form 1 {C}.\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - No [C] is available, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - No [C] is available, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Use 1 {A} and 1 {C} to form 1 (A) and 1 (B).\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - No {B} is available, so this method cannot be applied.\n\n8. **Cycle through Methods 1..6 again:**\n   - Method 1: Cannot be applied (no [C]).\n   - Method 2: Cannot be applied (no [A]).\n   - Method 3: Cannot be applied (no [C]).\n   - Method 4: Cannot be applied (no [C]).\n   - Method 5: Cannot be applied (no {A} or {C}).\n   - Method 6: Cannot be applied (no {B}).\n\nSince no more changes can be made, we have reached the final state.\n\n**Final Blocks:**\n- 0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is:\n<<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C)>>>\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 2 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B), 0 (C)>>>"
