    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 4 [A]\n   - 7 [B]\n   - 6 [C]\n\n2. **Apply Method 1:**\n   - Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - We can apply this method 4 times (limited by the number of [A] blocks).\n   - After 4 applications:\n     - 0 [A] (4 - 4)\n     - 3 [B] (7 - 4)\n     - 2 [C] (6 - 4)\n     - 4 {A}\n\n3. **Apply Method 2:**\n   - Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [A].\n\n4. **Apply Method 3:**\n   - Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - We can apply this method 2 times (limited by the number of [C] blocks).\n   - After 2 applications:\n     - 1 [B] (3 - 2)\n     - 0 [C] (2 - 2)\n     - 2 {B}\n\n5. **Apply Method 4:**\n   - Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 [C].\n\n6. **Apply Method 5:**\n   - Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We cannot apply this method because we have 0 {C}.\n\n7. **Apply Method 6:**\n   - Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n   - We can apply this method 1 time.\n   - After 1 application:\n     - 0 {B} (2 - 2)\n     - 1 (C)\n\n8. **Final Blocks:**\n   - 0 [A]\n   - 1 [B]\n   - 0 [C]\n   - 4 {A}\n   - 0 {B}\n   - 0 {C}\n   - 0 (A)\n   - 0 (B)\n   - 1 (C)\n\nThe synthesized block is 4 {A} and 1 (C).\n\nYour answer: <<<4{A}1(C)>>>"
