    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with 1 [A], 6 [B], and 6 [C].\n\n2. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 6 [C], so we can apply this method 3 times.\n   - After applying, we have 0 [C] and 3 {C}.\n\n3. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We have 6 [B] and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method yet.\n\n4. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [A] and 6 [B], so we can apply this method once.\n   - After applying, we have 0 [A], 5 [B], and 4 {C}.\n\n5. **Applying Method 4 Again:**\n   - We have 4 {C}, but Method 4 applies to [C], not {C}, so no changes here.\n\n6. **Applying Method 3 Again:**\n   - We have 5 [B] and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We have 0 {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n8. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We have 0 {A} and 4 {C}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n9. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We have 0 [A], 5 [B], and 0 [C], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n10. **Re-evaluate:**\n    - We have 0 [A], 5 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {B}, 4 {C}, 0 (A), 0 (B), 0 (C).\n    - No further methods can be applied.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are:\n- 0 [A]\n- 5 [B]\n- 0 [C]\n- 0 {A}\n- 0 {B}\n- 4 {C}\n- 0 (A)\n- 0 (B)\n- 0 (C)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nYour answer: <<<0,5,0,0,0,4,0,0,0>>>"
