    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Blocks:**\n   - 1 [A]\n   - 1 [B]\n   - 7 [C]\n\n2. **Applying Method 4:**\n   - Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 7 [C], so we can apply this method 3 times (using 6 [C] to form 3 {C}).\n   - Remaining blocks: 1 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C], 3 {C}\n\n3. **Applying Method 2:**\n   - One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - We have 1 [A] and 1 [B], so we can apply this method once.\n   - Remaining blocks: 0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 4 {C}\n\n4. **Applying Method 4 again:**\n   - We have 1 [C], which is not enough to apply Method 4 again.\n\n5. **Applying Method 5:**\n   - One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - We don't have any {A}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n6. **Applying Method 6:**\n   - Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - We don't have any {B}, so we cannot apply this method.\n\n7. **Applying Method 3:**\n   - One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - We don't have any [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\n8. **Applying Method 1:**\n   - One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - We don't have any [A] or [B], so we cannot apply this method.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. The final synthesized blocks are:\n\n- 0 [A]\n- 0 [B]\n- 1 [C]\n- 4 {C}\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nYour answer: <<<0 [A], 0 [B], 1 [C], 4 {C]>>>"
