    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules until no more combinations can be made. We will keep track of the number of each type of block and apply the rules in sequence, repeating the process until no further changes occur.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n2. Apply each rule in sequence:\n   - Rule 1: Check if we can form {A} from [A], [B], and [C].\n   - Rule 2: Check if we can form {C} from [A] and [B].\n   - Rule 3: Check if we can form {B} from [B] and [C].\n   - Rule 4: Check if we can form {C} from two [C].\n   - Rule 5: Check if we can form (A) and (B) from {A} and {C}.\n   - Rule 6: Check if we can form (C) from two {B}.\n3.
