    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll start with the initial counts of each block type and apply the rules in sequence until no more combinations can be made. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n2. Apply each rule in sequence:\n   - Rule 1: Check if we can form {A} from [A], [B], and [C].\n   - Rule 2: Check if we can form {C} from [A] and [B].\n   - Rule 3: Check if we can form {B} from [B] and [C].\n   - Rule 4: Check if we can form {C} from two [C].\n   - Rule 5: Check if we can form (A) and (B) from {A} and {C}.\n   - Rule 6: Check if we can form (C) from two {B}.\n3.
