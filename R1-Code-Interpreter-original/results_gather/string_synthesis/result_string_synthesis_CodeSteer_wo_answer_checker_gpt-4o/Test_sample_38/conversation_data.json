    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules until no more combinations can be made. We'll start with the initial counts of blocks and apply each method in sequence, updating the counts as we go. We'll repeat this process until no further changes occur.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: `[A]`, `[B]`, `[C]`, `{A}`, `{B}`, `{C}`, `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`.\n2. Apply each method in sequence:\n   - Method 1: Combine one `[A]`, one `[B]`, and one `[C]` to form one `{A}`.\n   - Method 2: Combine one `[A]` and one `[B]` to form one `{C}`.\n   - Method 3: Combine one `[B]` and one `[C]` to form one `{B}`.\n   - Method 4: Combine two `[C]` to form one `{C}`.\n   - Method 5: Combine one `{A}` and one `{C}` to form one `(A)` and one `(B)`.\n   - Method 6: Combine two `{B}` to form one `(C)`.\n3.
