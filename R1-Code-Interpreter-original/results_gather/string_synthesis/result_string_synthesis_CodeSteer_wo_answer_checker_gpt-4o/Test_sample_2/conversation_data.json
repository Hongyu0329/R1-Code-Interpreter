    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll repeatedly apply the rules in the specified order until no more combinations can be made. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the Blocks**: Start with the given number of each block type: 2 [A], 8 [B], and 7 [C].\n\n2. **Apply the Rules**: Cycle through the rules repeatedly:\n   - **Rule 1**: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - **Rule 2**: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - **Rule 3**: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - **Rule 4**: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - **Rule 5**: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - **Rule 6**: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n\n3. **Check for Changes**: After each full cycle of rules, check if any changes were made. If no changes occur, stop the process.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Count the final number of each type of block and format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the blocks\nblocks = {\n    '[A]': 2,\n    '[B]': 8,\n    '[C]': 7,\n    '{A}': 0,\n    '{B}': 0,\n    '{C}': 0,\n    '(A)': 0,\n    '(B)': 0,\n    '(C)': 0\n}\n\n# Function to apply the rules\ndef apply_rules(blocks):\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Rule 1\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{A}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Rule 2\n        while blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Rule 3\n        while blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n            blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n            blocks['{B}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Rule 4\n        while blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n            blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n            blocks['{C}'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Rule 5\n        while blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n            blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n            blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n            blocks['(A)'] += 1\n            blocks['(B)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Rule 6\n        while blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n            blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n            blocks['(C)'] += 1\n            changes = True\n\n# Apply the rules\napply_rules(blocks)\n\n# Format the output\nresult = f\"{blocks['[A]']}[A], {blocks['[B]']}[B], {blocks['[C]']}[C], {blocks['{A}']}{{A}}, {blocks['{B}']}{{B}}, {blocks['{C}']}{{C}}, {blocks['(A)']}({A}), {blocks['(B)']}({B}), {blocks['(C)']}({C})\"\nprint(f\"Your answer: {result}\")\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the process and print the final count of each type of block in the specified format.",
