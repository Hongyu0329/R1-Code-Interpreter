    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules until no more combinations can be made.

Initialize the counts of each block type: `[A]`, `[B]`, `[C]`, `{A}`, `{B}`, `{C}`, `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`.\n2. Apply the rules in sequence:\n   - Rule 1: Check if we can form `{A}` from `[A]`, `[B]`, and `[C]`.\n   - Rule 2: Check if we can form `{C}` from `[A]` and `[B]`.\n   - Rule 3: Check if we can form `{B}` from `[B]` and `[C]`.\n   - Rule 4: Check if we can form `{C}` from two `[C]`.\n   - Rule 5: Check if we can form `(A)` and `(B)` from `{A}` and `{C}`.\n   - Rule 6: Check if we can form `(C)` from two `{B}`.\n3.
