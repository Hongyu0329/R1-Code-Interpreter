    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules.

Initialize the counts of each block type: `[A]`, `[B]`, `[C]`, `{A}`, `{B}`, `{C}`, `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`.\n2. Apply the rules in order:\n   - Rule 1: Combine one `[A]`, one `[B]`, and one `[C]` to form one `{A}`.\n   - Rule 2: Combine one `[A]` and one `[B]` to form one `{C}`.\n   - Rule 3: Combine one `[B]` and one `[C]` to form one `{B}`.\n   - Rule 4: Combine two `[C]` to form one `{C}`.\n   - Rule 5: Combine one `{A}` and one `{C}` to form one `(A)` and one `(B)`.\n   - Rule 6: Combine two `{B}` to form one `(C)`.\n3.
