    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the Blocks**: Start with the given number of each block type: 4 [A], 7 [B], and 4 [C].\n\n2. **Define the Combination Methods**: Implement each of the six methods as functions that check if the combination is possible and then perform it.\n\n3. **Cycle Through Methods**: Continuously apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. This means checking each method in sequence and applying it if possible, then moving to the next method.\n\n4. **Check for Changes**: After each full cycle through the methods, check if any changes were made. If not, stop the process.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once no more changes can be made, output the final count of each block type in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the blocks\nblocks = {\n    '[A]': 4,\n    '[B]': 7,\n    '[C]': 4,\n    '{A}': 0,\n    '{B}': 0,\n    '{C}': 0,\n    '(A)': 0,\n    '(B)': 0,\n    '(C)': 0\n}\n\n# Define the combination methods\ndef method1():\n    if blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{A}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef method2():\n    if blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{C}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef method3():\n    if blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{B}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef method4():\n    if blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n        blocks['{C}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef method5():\n    if blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n        blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n        blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n        blocks['(A)'] += 1\n        blocks['(B)'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef method6():\n    if blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n        blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n        blocks['(C)'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Cycle through methods until no more changes can be made\nchanged = True\nwhile changed:\n    changed = False\n    for method in [method1, method2, method3, method4, method5, method6]:\n        while method():\n            changed = True\n\n# Output the result\nresult = f\"{blocks['[A]']}[A], {blocks['[B]']}[B], {blocks['[C]']}[C], {blocks['{A}']}{{A}}, {blocks['{B}']}{{B}}, {blocks['{C}']}{{C}}, {blocks['(A)']}({A}), {blocks['(B)']}({B}), {blocks['(C)']}({C})\"\nprint(f\"Your answer: {result}\")\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the process and print the final count of each block type in the specified format.",
