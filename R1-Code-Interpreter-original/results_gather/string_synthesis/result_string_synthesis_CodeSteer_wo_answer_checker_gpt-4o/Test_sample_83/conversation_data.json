    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll start with the initial blocks and apply the rules in sequence until no more combinations can be made. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n2. Apply each rule in sequence:\n   - Rule 1: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - Rule 2: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - Rule 3: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - Rule 4: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - Rule 5: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Rule 6: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n3. Repeat the application of rules until no more combinations can be made.\n4.
