    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll start with the initial counts of each block type and apply the rules in sequence until no more combinations can be made. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: `[A]`, `[B]`, `[C]`, `{A}`, `{B}`, `{C}`, `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`.\n2. Define a function to apply each rule and update the block counts accordingly.\n3. Use a loop to repeatedly apply the rules until no more changes occur.\n4.
