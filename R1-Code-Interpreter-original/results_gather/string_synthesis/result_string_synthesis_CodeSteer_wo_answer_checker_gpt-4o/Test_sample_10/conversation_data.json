    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll repeatedly apply the rules in the specified order until no more combinations can be made. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n2. Define a function to apply each rule and update the block counts accordingly.\n3. Use a loop to apply the rules in sequence until no more changes occur.\n4.
