    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n2. Use a loop to apply the methods in sequence:\n   - Method 1: Check if we can form {A} from [A], [B], and [C].\n   - Method 2: Check if we can form {C} from [A] and [B].\n   - Method 3: Check if we can form {B} from [B] and [C].\n   - Method 4: Check if we can form {C} from two [C].\n   - Method 5: Check if we can form (A) and (B) from {A} and {C}.\n   - Method 6: Check if we can form (C) from two {B}.\n3.
