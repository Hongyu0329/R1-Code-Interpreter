    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: `[A]`, `[B]`, `[C]`, `{A}`, `{B}`, `{C}`, `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`.\n\n2. Define a function to apply each method:\n   - Method 1: Combine one `[A]`, one `[B]`, and one `[C]` to form one `{A}`.\n   - Method 2: Combine one `[A]` and one `[B]` to form one `{C}`.\n   - Method 3: Combine one `[B]` and one `[C]` to form one `{B}`.\n   - Method 4: Combine two `[C]` to form one `{C}`.\n   - Method 5: Combine one `{A}` and one `{C}` to form one `(A)` and one `(B)`.\n   - Method 6: Combine two `{B}` to form one `(C)`.\n\n3.
