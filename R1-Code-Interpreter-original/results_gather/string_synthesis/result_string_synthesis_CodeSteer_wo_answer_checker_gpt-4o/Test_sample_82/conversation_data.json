    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules until no more combinations can be made. We will keep track of the number of each type of block and apply the rules in sequence repeatedly.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: `[A]`, `[B]`, `[C]`, `{A}`, `{B}`, `{C}`, `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`.\n2. Apply the rules in sequence:\n   - Rule 1: Combine one `[A]`, one `[B]`, and one `[C]` to form one `{A}`.\n   - Rule 2: Combine one `[A]` and one `[B]` to form one `{C}`.\n   - Rule 3: Combine one `[B]` and one `[C]` to form one `{B}`.\n   - Rule 4: Combine two `[C]` to form one `{C}`.\n   - Rule 5: Combine one `{A}` and one `{C}` to form one `(A)` and one `(B)`.\n   - Rule 6: Combine two `{B}` to form one `(C)`.\n3.
