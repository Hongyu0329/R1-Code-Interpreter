    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll repeatedly apply the methods in order until no more combinations can be made. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial counts of blocks: 3 [A], 5 [B], and 7 [C].\n2. Apply each method in sequence:\n   - Method 1: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - Method 2: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - Method 3: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - Method 4: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - Method 5: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Method 6: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n3. Repeat the cycle until no more combinations can be made.\n4. Count the final number of each type of block.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial counts of blocks\nA = 3\nB = 5\nC = 7\ncurly_A = 0\ncurly_B = 0\ncurly_C = 0\nparen_A = 0\nparen_B = 0\nparen_C = 0\n\n# Function to apply the methods\ndef apply_methods():\n    global A, B, C, curly_A, curly_B, curly_C, paren_A, paren_B, paren_C\n    changes = True\n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        # Method 1\n        while A >= 1 and B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            curly_A += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 2\n        while A >= 1 and B >= 1:\n            A -= 1\n            B -= 1\n            curly_C += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 3\n        while B >= 1 and C >= 1:\n            B -= 1\n            C -= 1\n            curly_B += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 4\n        while C >= 2:\n            C -= 2\n            curly_C += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 5\n        while curly_A >= 1 and curly_C >= 1:\n            curly_A -= 1\n            curly_C -= 1\n            paren_A += 1\n            paren_B += 1\n            changes = True\n        # Method 6\n        while curly_B >= 2:\n            curly_B -= 2\n            paren_C += 1\n            changes = True\n\n# Apply the methods\napply_methods()\n\n# Print the final counts\nprint(f\"Your answer: {paren_A}{paren_B}{paren_C}\")\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the process and print the final synthesized block in the required format."
