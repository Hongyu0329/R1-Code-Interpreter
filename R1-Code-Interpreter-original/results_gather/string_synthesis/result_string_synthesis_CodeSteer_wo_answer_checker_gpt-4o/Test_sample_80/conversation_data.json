    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules until no more combinations can be made.

Initialize the counts of each block type: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n2. Apply each rule in sequence:\n   - Rule 1: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - Rule 2: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - Rule 3: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - Rule 4: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - Rule 5: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Rule 6: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n3.
