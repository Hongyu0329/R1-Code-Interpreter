    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules. We'll start with the initial counts of blocks [A], [B], and [C], and then apply the rules in sequence until no more combinations can be made. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C).\n2. Apply each rule in sequence:\n   - Rule 1: Combine one [A], one [B], and one [C] to form one {A}.\n   - Rule 2: Combine one [A] and one [B] to form one {C}.\n   - Rule 3: Combine one [B] and one [C] to form one {B}.\n   - Rule 4: Combine two [C] to form one {C}.\n   - Rule 5: Combine one {A} and one {C} to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Rule 6: Combine two {B} to form one (C).\n3.
