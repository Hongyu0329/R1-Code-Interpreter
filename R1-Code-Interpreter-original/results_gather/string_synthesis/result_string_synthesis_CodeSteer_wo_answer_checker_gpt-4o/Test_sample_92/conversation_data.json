    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of combining blocks according to the given rules until no more combinations can be made. We will keep track of the number of each type of block and apply the rules in sequence repeatedly.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the counts of each block type: `[A]`, `[B]`, `[C]`, `{A}`, `{B}`, `{C}`, `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)`.\n2. Apply the rules in sequence:\n   - Rule 1: If there is at least one `[A]`, one `[B]`, and one `[C]`, combine them to form one `{A}`.\n   - Rule 2: If there is at least one `[A]` and one `[B]`, combine them to form one `{C}`.\n   - Rule 3: If there is at least one `[B]` and one `[C]`, combine them to form one `{B}`.\n   - Rule 4: If there are at least two `[C]`, combine them to form one `{C}`.\n   - Rule 5: If there is at least one `{A}` and one `{C}`, combine them to form one `(A)` and one `(B)`.\n   - Rule 6: If there are at least two `{B}`, combine them to form one `(C)`.\n3.
