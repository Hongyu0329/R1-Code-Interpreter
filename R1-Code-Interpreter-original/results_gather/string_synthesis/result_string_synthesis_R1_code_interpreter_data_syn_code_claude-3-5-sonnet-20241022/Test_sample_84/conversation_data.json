    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process.

The program simulates the synthesis process by repeatedly applying all methods until no more changes can be made\n2. It keeps track of the count of each type of block\n3. The final output shows all remaining blocks and their counts\n\nBased on the output, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<[A]:1 [B]:2 [C]:2 {B}:1 (A):1 (B):1 (C):1>>>",
    "I see the output shows we ended up with 5 {A} blocks and 1 {B} block. Let me verify this result by walking through the synthesis process manually:\n\nInitial state: 5 [A], 6 [B], 6 [C]\n\nLet's apply the methods systematically:\n1. Method 1 ([A]+[B]+[C]->{A}): Can be applied 5 times because we have enough of each\n   After this: 0 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C], 5 {A}\n2. Method 3 ([B]+[C]->{B}): Can be applied once with remaining [B] and [C]\n   After this: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 5 {A}, 1 {B}\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied because:\n- Method 1: No [A], [B], [C] left\n- Method 2: No [A], [B] left\n- Method 3: No [B], [C] left\n- Method 4: No [C] left\n- Method 5: Need both {A} and {C}, but no {C}\n- Method 6: Need 2 {B}, but only have 1\n\nTherefore, the final state is correct:\n\n<<<{A}:5 {B}:1>>>"
