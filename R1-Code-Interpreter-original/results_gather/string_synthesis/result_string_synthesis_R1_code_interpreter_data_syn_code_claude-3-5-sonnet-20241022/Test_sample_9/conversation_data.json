    "I see the code output shows we ended up with 3 {A}.

Looking at the rules again:\n\n1) We start with 3 [A], 3 [B], 3 [C]\n2) Rule 1 can be applied three times, resulting in 3 {A}\n3) We can't apply any other rules because:\n   - Rule 2-4 require square brackets blocks which we don't have\n   - Rule 5 requires {C} which we don't have\n   - Rule 6 requires {B} which we don't have\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3 {A}>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me verify if this is indeed the final state:\n\n1) Initial state: 3 [A], 3 [B], 3 [C]\n\n2) First phase (Rule 1 applied three times):\n   - First application: 2 [A], 2 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}\n   - Second application: 1 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C], 2 {A}\n   - Third application: 3 {A}\n\n3) Final state: 3 {A}\n\n4) Checking if any more rules can be applied:\n   - Rule 1: No (requires [A], [B], [C])\n   - Rule 2: No (requires [A], [B])\n   - Rule 3: No (requires [B], [C])\n   - Rule 4: No (requires [C])\n   - Rule 5: No (requires {A} and {C} - we have {A} but no {C})\n   - Rule 6: No (requires {B})\n\nThe simulation shows that after converting all square bracket blocks [A], [B], [C] into {A} using Rule 1, no further combinations are possible. This is because all other rules either require square bracket blocks (which we've used up) or require blocks we don't have ({B}, {C}).\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the final answer is:\n\n<<<3 {A}>>>"
