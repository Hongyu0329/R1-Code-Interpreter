    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process.

Starting with initial blocks: 3[A], 6[B], 7[C]\n2. Applying each rule in sequence until it can't be applied anymore\n3. Continuing this process until no more changes can be made\n4. Printing the final state of all blocks\n\nBased on the code execution output, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<1 [A], 2 [B], 1 [C], 1 {B}, 2 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)>>>",
    "I apologize for the discrepancy.
