    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process. I'll create a Python program that:\n   - Keeps track of the count of each block type\n   - Implements each synthesis method\n   - Cycles through methods until no more changes can be made\n\n2) The program needs to:\n   - Try each method in order\n   - If any method succeeds, start over from method 1\n   - Continue until no method can be applied\n\nHere's the code to simulate this process:\n\n```python\ndef apply_method_1(blocks):\n    # [A] + [B] + [C] -> {A}\n    if blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{A}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method_2(blocks):\n    # [A] + [B] -> {C}\n    if blocks['[A]'] >= 1 and blocks['[B]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[A]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{C}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method_3(blocks):\n    # [B] + [C] -> {B}\n    if blocks['[B]'] >= 1 and blocks['[C]'] >= 1:\n        blocks['[B]'] -= 1\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 1\n        blocks['{B}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method_4(blocks):\n    # [C] + [C] -> {C}\n    if blocks['[C]'] >= 2:\n        blocks['[C]'] -= 2\n        blocks['{C}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method_5(blocks):\n    # {A} + {C} -> (A) + (B)\n    if blocks['{A}'] >= 1 and blocks['{C}'] >= 1:\n        blocks['{A}'] -= 1\n        blocks['{C}'] -= 1\n        blocks['(A)'] += 1\n        blocks['(B)'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method_6(blocks):\n    # {B} + {B} -> (C)\n    if blocks['{B}'] >= 2:\n        blocks['{B}'] -= 2\n        blocks['(C)'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef synthesize():\n    blocks = {\n        '[A]': 5, '[B]': 7, '[C]': 1,\n        '{A}': 0, '{B}': 0, '{C}': 0,\n        '(A)': 0, '(B)': 0, '(C)': 0\n    }\n    \n    while True:\n        any_change = False\n        methods = [apply_method_1, apply_method_2, apply_method_3, \n                  apply_method_4, apply_method_5, apply_method_6]\n        \n        for method in methods:\n            if method(blocks):\n                any_change = True\n                break\n        \n        if not any_change:\n            break\n    \n    result = \"\"\n    for block, count in blocks.items():\n        if count > 0:\n            result += f\"{count} {block}, \"\n    print(result[:-2])\n\nsynthesize()\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output. The program simulates the synthesis process by:\n1. Starting with 5 [A], 7 [B], and 1 [C]\n2. Applying each method in order\n3. If any method succeeds, starting over from method 1\n4.
