The previous simulation confirms that we end up with 4 {A} and 1 {B}.\n\nLet's verify this:\n1. Initially: 4[A], 5[B], 5[C]\n2. We can apply Rule 1 ([A]+[B]+[C]->{A}) four times because we have enough of each component\n3. After these four applications, we have:\n   - 0[A], 1[B], 1[C], 4{A}\n4. With the remaining [B] and [C], we can apply Rule 3 to get {B}\n\nThis explains why we end up with 4{A} and 1{B}.\n\n<<<4 {A}, 1 {B}>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let's break down what happened:\n\n1. Initial state: 4[A], 5[B], 5[C]\n\n2. Step 1: Applied Rule 1 ([A]+[B]+[C]->{A})\n   - Used 1[A], 1[B], 1[C]\n   - Result: 3[A], 4[B], 4[C], 1{A}\n\n3. Step 2: Applied Rule 1 again\n   - Used 1[A], 1[B], 1[C]\n   - Result: 2[A], 3[B], 3[C], 2{A}\n\n4. Step 3: Applied Rule 1 again\n   - Used 1[A], 1[B], 1[C]\n   - Result: 1[A], 2[B], 2[C], 3{A}\n\n5. Step 4: Applied Rule 1 one last time\n   - Used 1[A], 1[B], 1[C]\n   - Result: 1[B], 1[C], 4{A}\n\n6. Step 5: Applied Rule 3 ([B]+[C]->{B})\n   - Used remaining 1[B], 1[C]\n   - Final result: 4{A}, 1{B}\n\nNo more rules can be applied because:\n- No [A], [B], [C] blocks left for Rule 1\n- No [A] and [B] left for Rule 2\n- No [B] and [C] left for Rule 3\n- No [C] pairs left for Rule 4\n- No {A} and {C} combination for Rule 5\n- Only one {B}, need two for Rule 6\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<4 {A}, 1 {B}>>>"
