    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process.

The program simulates the synthesis process by repeatedly applying all methods in order\n2. It continues until no more combinations are possible\n3.

    "I see the simulation output is different from my prediction. Let me verify this result by walking through the process manually:\n\nStarting with: 5[A], 6[B], 4[C]\n\nLet's go through the methods sequentially:\n1.

Method 3 ([B]+[C]->{B}):\n   - Using 1[B] and 1[C]: 1[A], 1[B], 3[C], 4{C}, 1{B}\n\n3. No other methods can be applied effectively because:\n   - Method 1 needs [A], [B], and [C]\n   - Method 2 needs both [A] and [B]\n   - Method 3 needs both [B] and [C]\n   - Method 4 needs two [C]s\n   - Method 5 needs {A} and {C}\n   - Method 6 needs two {B}s\n\n4. Method 5 ({A}+{C}->(A)+(B)) can be applied once:\n   - Using 1{C}: Now have 1{B}, 3{C}, 1(A), 1(B)\n\nThe simulation output shows: 1{B}, 4{C}, 1(A), 1(B)\n\nThis matches with my manual verification except for one {C}, which means my manual calculation missed one step.
