    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process.

The program simulates the synthesis process by:\n1. First converting pairs of [C] into {C} using method 4\n2. Using [A] and [B] to create additional {C} using method 2\n3. Using remaining blocks to create other combinations\n4.

    "I see the code execution output.
