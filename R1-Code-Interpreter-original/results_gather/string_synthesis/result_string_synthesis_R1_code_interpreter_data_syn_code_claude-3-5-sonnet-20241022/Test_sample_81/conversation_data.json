    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process.

It starts with 5 [A], 7 [B], and 5 [C]\n2. It repeatedly applies rules 1-6 in order\n3. For each cycle, it tries to apply each rule as many times as possible\n4. It continues until no more rules can be applied\n5.

    "I notice that my previous simulation didn't match the actual output.

    "The output confirms my previous analysis.

    "The code confirms that no further synthesis is possible with the current blocks (2 [B], 5 {A}).
