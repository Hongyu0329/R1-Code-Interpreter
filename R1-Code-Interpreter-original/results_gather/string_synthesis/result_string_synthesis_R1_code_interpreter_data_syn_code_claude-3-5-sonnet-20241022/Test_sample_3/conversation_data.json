    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process. I'll need to:\n   - Track the count of each type of block\n   - Implement each combination rule\n   - Keep applying rules until no more changes can be made\n   - Handle multiple possible combinations in each step\n\n2) I'll write a Python program that:\n   - Represents the current state as a dictionary\n   - Implements each rule as a function\n   - Cycles through rules until no changes occur\n   - Tracks all possible combinations\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule1(state):\n    # [A] + [B] + [C] -> {A}\n    if state['[A]'] >= 1 and state['[B]'] >= 1 and state['[C]'] >= 1:\n        new_state = state.copy()\n        new_state['[A]'] -= 1\n        new_state['[B]'] -= 1\n        new_state['[C]'] -= 1\n        new_state['{A}'] += 1\n        return new_state\n    return None\n\ndef apply_rule2(state):\n    # [A] + [B] -> {C}\n    if state['[A]'] >= 1 and state['[B]'] >= 1:\n        new_state = state.copy()\n        new_state['[A]'] -= 1\n        new_state['[B]'] -= 1\n        new_state['{C}'] += 1\n        return new_state\n    return None\n\ndef apply_rule3(state):\n    # [B] + [C] -> {B}\n    if state['[B]'] >= 1 and state['[C]'] >= 1:\n        new_state = state.copy()\n        new_state['[B]'] -= 1\n        new_state['[C]'] -= 1\n        new_state['{B}'] += 1\n        return new_state\n    return None\n\ndef apply_rule4(state):\n    # [C] + [C] -> {C}\n    if state['[C]'] >= 2:\n        new_state = state.copy()\n        new_state['[C]'] -= 2\n        new_state['{C}'] += 1\n        return new_state\n    return None\n\ndef apply_rule5(state):\n    # {A} + {C} -> (A) + (B)\n    if state['{A}'] >= 1 and state['{C}'] >= 1:\n        new_state = state.copy()\n        new_state['{A}'] -= 1\n        new_state['{C}'] -= 1\n        new_state['(A)'] += 1\n        new_state['(B)'] += 1\n        return new_state\n    return None\n\ndef apply_rule6(state):\n    # {B} + {B} -> (C)\n    if state['{B}'] >= 2:\n        new_state = state.copy()\n        new_state['{B}'] -= 2\n        new_state['(C)'] += 1\n        return new_state\n    return None\n\ndef process_synthesis():\n    # Initial state\n    state = {\n        '[A]': 5, '[B]': 1, '[C]': 1,\n        '{A}': 0, '{B}': 0, '{C}': 0,\n        '(A)': 0, '(B)': 0, '(C)': 0\n    }\n    \n    rules = [apply_rule1, apply_rule2, apply_rule3, apply_rule4, apply_rule5, apply_rule6]\n    changes = True\n    \n    while changes:\n        changes = False\n        for rule in rules:\n            new_state = rule(state)\n            if new_state:\n                state = new_state\n                changes = True\n                break\n    \n    # Format result\n    result = []\n    for block, count in state.items():\n        if count > 0:\n            result.append(f\"{count} {block}\")\n    \n    print(\", \".join(result))\n\nprocess_synthesis()\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output:\nThe program simulates the synthesis process:\n1.
