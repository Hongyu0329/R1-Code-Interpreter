    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process.

Initially: 1[A], 4[B], 4[C]\n2. The program will systematically apply all rules in sequence until no more combinations are possible\n3. The output shows the final state after all possible combinations\n\nBased on the code execution output, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<2 [B], 1 {B}, 1 (C)>>>",
    "I see the code execution output is different from my analysis.
