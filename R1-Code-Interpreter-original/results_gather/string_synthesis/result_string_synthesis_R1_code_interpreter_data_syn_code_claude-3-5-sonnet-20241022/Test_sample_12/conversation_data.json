    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process. I'll create a Python program that:\n   - Keeps track of the count of each block type\n   - Implements each synthesis method\n   - Cycles through methods until no more changes can be made\n\n2) The program needs to:\n   - Try each method in order\n   - If any method succeeds, start over from method 1\n   - Continue until no method can be applied\n\n3) Let's write a program to simulate this:\n\n```python\ndef can_apply_method(counts, method_num):\n    if method_num == 1:\n        return counts['[A]'] >= 1 and counts['[B]'] >= 1 and counts['[C]'] >= 1\n    elif method_num == 2:\n        return counts['[A]'] >= 1 and counts['[B]'] >= 1\n    elif method_num == 3:\n        return counts['[B]'] >= 1 and counts['[C]'] >= 1\n    elif method_num == 4:\n        return counts['[C]'] >= 2\n    elif method_num == 5:\n        return counts['{A}'] >= 1 and counts['{C}'] >= 1\n    elif method_num == 6:\n        return counts['{B}'] >= 2\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method(counts, method_num):\n    if method_num == 1:\n        counts['[A]'] -= 1\n        counts['[B]'] -= 1\n        counts['[C]'] -= 1\n        counts['{A}'] += 1\n    elif method_num == 2:\n        counts['[A]'] -= 1\n        counts['[B]'] -= 1\n        counts['{C}'] += 1\n    elif method_num == 3:\n        counts['[B]'] -= 1\n        counts['[C]'] -= 1\n        counts['{B}'] += 1\n    elif method_num == 4:\n        counts['[C]'] -= 2\n        counts['{C}'] += 1\n    elif method_num == 5:\n        counts['{A}'] -= 1\n        counts['{C}'] -= 1\n        counts['(A)'] += 1\n        counts['(B)'] += 1\n    elif method_num == 6:\n        counts['{B}'] -= 2\n        counts['(C)'] += 1\n\ndef synthesize():\n    # Initial counts\n    counts = {\n        '[A]': 3, '[B]': 2, '[C]': 6,\n        '{A}': 0, '{B}': 0, '{C}': 0,\n        '(A)': 0, '(B)': 0, '(C)': 0\n    }\n    \n    while True:\n        changes_made = False\n        for method in range(1, 7):\n            while can_apply_method(counts, method):\n                apply_method(counts, method)\n                changes_made = True\n        if not changes_made:\n            break\n    \n    # Print final counts\n    result = \"\"\n    for block in sorted(counts.keys()):\n        if counts[block] > 0:\n            result += f\"{counts[block]} {block}, \"\n    print(result[:-2])\n\nsynthesize()\n```\n\nLet's analyze what this code does:\n1. We define functions to check if a method can be applied and to apply the method\n2. We start with initial counts: 3 [A], 2 [B], 6 [C]\n3. We keep applying methods 1-6 in order until no more changes can be made\n4. The program prints the final counts of all blocks\n\nAfter running the code, we can see the final result.
