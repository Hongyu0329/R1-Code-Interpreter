    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process. I'll need to:\n   - Track the count of each block type\n   - Implement each combination method\n   - Repeatedly cycle through all methods until no more changes can be made\n\n2) I'll write a Python program that:\n   - Represents the current state as a dictionary\n   - Implements each combination method as a function\n   - Cycles through methods until no changes occur\n   - Handles the synthesis process systematically\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_method1(state):\n    # [A] + [B] + [C] -> {A}\n    if state['[A]'] >= 1 and state['[B]'] >= 1 and state['[C]'] >= 1:\n        state['[A]'] -= 1\n        state['[B]'] -= 1\n        state['[C]'] -= 1\n        state['{A}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method2(state):\n    # [A] + [B] -> {C}\n    if state['[A]'] >= 1 and state['[B]'] >= 1:\n        state['[A]'] -= 1\n        state['[B]'] -= 1\n        state['{C}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method3(state):\n    # [B] + [C] -> {B}\n    if state['[B]'] >= 1 and state['[C]'] >= 1:\n        state['[B]'] -= 1\n        state['[C]'] -= 1\n        state['{B}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method4(state):\n    # [C] + [C] -> {C}\n    if state['[C]'] >= 2:\n        state['[C]'] -= 2\n        state['{C}'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method5(state):\n    # {A} + {C} -> (A) + (B)\n    if state['{A}'] >= 1 and state['{C}'] >= 1:\n        state['{A}'] -= 1\n        state['{C}'] -= 1\n        state['(A)'] += 1\n        state['(B)'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef apply_method6(state):\n    # {B} + {B} -> (C)\n    if state['{B}'] >= 2:\n        state['{B}'] -= 2\n        state['(C)'] += 1\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef synthesize():\n    # Initial state\n    state = {\n        '[A]': 4, '[B]': 2, '[C]': 2,\n        '{A}': 0, '{B}': 0, '{C}': 0,\n        '(A)': 0, '(B)': 0, '(C)': 0\n    }\n    \n    while True:\n        changes = False\n        # Try each method in order\n        if apply_method1(state): changes = True\n        if apply_method2(state): changes = True\n        if apply_method3(state): changes = True\n        if apply_method4(state): changes = True\n        if apply_method5(state): changes = True\n        if apply_method6(state): changes = True\n        \n        if not changes:\n            break\n    \n    # Create result string\n    result = []\n    for block, count in state.items():\n        if count > 0:\n            result.append(f\"{count}{block}\")\n    return \" \".join(result)\n\nprint(synthesize())\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output:\n1. Initially: 4[A], 2[B], 2[C]\n2. Method 1: [A]+[B]+[C] -> {A} (can be done once)\n3. Method 2: [A]+[B] -> {C} (can be done once)\n4. Method 4: [C]+[C] -> {C} (not possible as only one [C] remains)\n5. Method 5: {A}+{C} -> (A)+(B)\n\nAfter all possible combinations, we get:\n\n<<<2[A] 0[B] 0[C] 0{A} 0{B} 0{C} 1(A) 1(B) 0(C)>>>",
    "I see the code output shows 2[A] 1[C] 1(A) 1(B). Let me verify this result by manually going through the synthesis process:\n\nInitial state: 4[A], 2[B], 2[C]\n\nLet's go through the methods sequentially:\n1. Method 1: [A]+[B]+[C] → {A}\n   - After: 3[A], 1[B], 1[C], 1{A}\n\n2. Method 2: [A]+[B] → {C}\n   - After: 2[A], 0[B], 1[C], 1{A}, 1{C}\n\n3. Method 5: {A}+{C} → (A)+(B)\n   - After: 2[A], 0[B], 1[C], 0{A}, 0{C}, 1(A), 1(B)\n\nAt this point, no more combinations are possible because:\n- Can't use Method 1 (not enough [B])\n- Can't use Method 2 (no [B])\n- Can't use Method 3 (no [B])\n- Can't use Method 4 (only one [C])\n- Can't use Method 5 (no {A} or {C})\n- Can't use Method 6 (no {B})\n\nThe code output matches this manual verification. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2[A] 1[C] 1(A) 1(B)>>>"
