Method 5: Requires {A}, {C} - Not possible\n6. Method 6: Requires two {B} - Not possible\n\nNone of the methods can be applied to (A) or (B) blocks, so this is indeed the final state.\n\nTo double-check this is the only possible sequence, let's verify our steps were optimal:\n1. First step had to be Method 4 to combine two [C]s, as it's the only method that could be applied initially\n2. Then Method 2 was the only way to use [A] and [B]\n3. The remaining [C] had to be combined using Method 4\n4. This gave us three {C}s\n5. Method 5 was the only applicable method for {C}s\n6.
