    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to create a simulation of the synthesis process.

We can only use Method 2 once with 1[A] and 1[B] to make 1{C}\n2. We can use Method 4 once with 2[C] to make another {C}\n3. We can use Method 5 once with the remaining {C} to make 1(A) and 1(B)\n4. The remaining blocks are 3[A], as we can't combine them further without other required blocks",
    "The code output shows the exact sequence of transformations:\n\n1. First, Method 1 was applied:\n   4[A], 1[B], 3[C] → 3[A], 0[B], 2[C], 1{A}\n\n2.
