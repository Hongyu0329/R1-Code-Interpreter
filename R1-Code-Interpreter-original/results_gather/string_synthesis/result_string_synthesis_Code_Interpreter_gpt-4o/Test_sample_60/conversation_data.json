    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the given methods repeatedly until no more changes can be made. Let's start with the initial blocks: 1 [A], 1 [B], and 3 [C].\n\nWe'll apply the methods in order and keep track of the blocks:\n\n1. **Method 1**: One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n   - Apply once: 1 [A], 1 [B], 1 [C] → 1 {A}\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 0 [B], 2 [C], 1 {A}\n\n2. **Method 2**: One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Cannot apply (no [A] or [B] left).\n\n3. **Method 3**: One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n   - Cannot apply (no [B] left).\n\n4. **Method 4**: Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n   - Apply once: 2 [C] → 1 {C}\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 1 {A}, 1 {C}\n\n5. **Method 5**: One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n   - Apply once: 1 {A}, 1 {C} → 1 (A), 1 (B)\n   - Remaining: 0 [A], 0 [B], 0 [C], 0 {A}, 0 {C}, 1 (A), 1 (B)\n\n6. **Method 6**: Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n   - Cannot apply (no {B} left).\n\nNow, let's check if any more methods can be applied. Since we have no [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, or {C} left, no further methods can be applied.\n\nThe final synthesized blocks are: 1 (A), 1 (B).\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\nYour answer: <<<1 (A), 1 (B)>>>"
