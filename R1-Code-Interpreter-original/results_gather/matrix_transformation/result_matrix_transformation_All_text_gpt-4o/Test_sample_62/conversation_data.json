    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     M C K X\n     8 7 N C\n     Q M V 1\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - We will create a new matrix where:\n     - The first column of the new matrix is the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n     - The second column of the new matrix is the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n     - The third column of the new matrix is the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n   - This can be visualized as:\n     ```\n     Original Matrix:        Rotated Matrix:\n     M C K X                 Q 8 M\n     8 7 N C                 M 7 C\n     Q M V 1                 V N K\n                             1 C X\n     ```\n\n5. **Fill the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The first column of the rotated matrix is the reverse of the first row of the original matrix: `Q, 8, M`.\n   - The second column of the rotated matrix is the reverse of the second row of the original matrix: `M, 7, C`.\n   - The third column of the rotated matrix is the reverse of the third row of the original matrix: `V, N, K`.\n   - The fourth column of the rotated matrix is the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix: `1, C, X`.\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final rotated matrix should be formatted as a list of values and symbols, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n<<<Q,8,M,M,7,C,V,N,K,1,C,X>>>"
