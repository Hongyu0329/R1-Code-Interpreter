    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     2 1 3\n     3 7 7\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a 2D array:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"2\", \"1\", \"3\"],\n       [\"3\", \"7\", \"7\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions**:\n   - The matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - When rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Start with an empty matrix of dimensions `3x2` (since the original matrix is `2x3`, the rotated matrix will be `3x2`).\n   - Place each element from the original matrix into its new position in the rotated matrix:\n     - The element at `(0, 0)` in the original matrix (\"2\") moves to `(0, 1)` in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at `(0, 1)` in the original matrix (\"1\") moves to `(1, 1)` in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at `(0, 2)` in the original matrix (\"3\") moves to `(2, 1)` in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at `(1, 0)` in the original matrix (\"3\") moves to `(0, 0)` in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at `(1, 1)` in the original matrix (\"7\") moves to `(1, 0)` in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at `(1, 2)` in the original matrix (\"7\") moves to `(2, 0)` in the rotated matrix.\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After placing all elements, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"3\", \"2\"],\n       [\"7\", \"1\"],\n       [\"7\", \"3\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the 2D array into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The final output should be: <<<3,2,7,1,7,3>>>\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<3,2,7,1,7,3>>>"
