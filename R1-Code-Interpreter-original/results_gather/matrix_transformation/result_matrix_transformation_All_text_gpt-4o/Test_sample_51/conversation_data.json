    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     M J B\n     T V R\n     M B E\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix (3 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element:\n     - The first row `M J B` becomes the last column:\n       - `M` (0,0) goes to (0,2)\n       - `J` (0,1) goes to (1,2)\n       - `B` (0,2) goes to (2,2)\n     - The second row `T V R` becomes the second column:\n       - `T` (1,0) goes to (0,1)\n       - `V` (1,1) goes to (1,1)\n       - `R` (1,2) goes to (2,1)\n     - The third row `M B E` becomes the first column:\n       - `M` (2,0) goes to (0,0)\n       - `B` (2,1) goes to (1,0)\n       - `E` (2,2) goes to (2,0)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     M T M\n     B V J\n     E R B\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - According to the required format, we need to output the matrix as a list of values and symbols, separated by commas and enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<M,T,M,B,V,J,E,R,B>>>"
