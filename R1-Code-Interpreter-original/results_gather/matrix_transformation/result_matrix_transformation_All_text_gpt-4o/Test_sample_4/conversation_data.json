    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     Z T\n     O H\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix with two rows and two columns.\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a matrix where the number of rows becomes the number of columns and vice versa.\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the resulting matrix will also be 2x2.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic:**\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n     - The first column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the new matrix, but in reverse order.\n     - The second column of the original matrix becomes the second row of the new matrix, also in reverse order.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     Z T\n     O H\n     ```\n   - First column of the original matrix: `Z, O`\n     - This becomes the first row of the new matrix: `O, Z`\n   - Second column of the original matrix: `T, H`\n     - This becomes the second row of the new matrix: `H, T`\n\n5. **Construct the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - After applying the rotation, the resulting matrix is:\n     ```\n     O Z\n     H T\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The resulting matrix should be represented as a single list in row-major order: `O, Z, H, T`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<O,Z,H,T>>>"
