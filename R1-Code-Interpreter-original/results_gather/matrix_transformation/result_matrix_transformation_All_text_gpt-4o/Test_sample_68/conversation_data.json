    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns):\n     ```\n     N H Y 9\n     X L W F\n     T 1 5 F\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix will have dimensions 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Start with the last row of the original matrix and make it the first column of the new matrix.\n   - Continue this process for each row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Construction**:\n   - Original last row `T 1 5 F` becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n   - Original second row `X L W F` becomes the second column of the new matrix.\n   - Original first row `N H Y 9` becomes the third column of the new matrix.\n\n6. **Resulting Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix after rotation will be:\n     ```\n     T X N\n     1 L H\n     5 W Y\n     F F 9\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified output format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the rotated matrix.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<T,X,N,1,L,H,5,W,Y,F,F,9>>>"
