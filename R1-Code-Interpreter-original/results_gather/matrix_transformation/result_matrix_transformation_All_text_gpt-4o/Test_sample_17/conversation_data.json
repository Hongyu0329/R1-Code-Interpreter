    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     R N\n     C P\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - Rotating a 2x2 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in another 2x2 matrix.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic:**\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n     - The element at the first row, first column (top-left) moves to the first row, last column (top-right).\n     - The element at the first row, last column (top-right) moves to the last row, last column (bottom-right).\n     - The element at the last row, first column (bottom-left) moves to the first row, first column (top-left).\n     - The element at the last row, last column (bottom-right) moves to the last row, first column (bottom-left).\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     R N\n     C P\n     ```\n   - After rotation:\n     - The element 'R' (first row, first column) moves to the first row, second column.\n     - The element 'N' (first row, second column) moves to the second row, second column.\n     - The element 'C' (second row, first column) moves to the first row, first column.\n     - The element 'P' (second row, second column) moves to the second row, first column.\n\n5. **Construct the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - After applying the above logic, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     C R\n     P N\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - For the resulting matrix:\n     ```\n     C R\n     P N\n     ```\n   - The formatted output is: <<<C,R,P,N>>>\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<C,R,P,N>>>"
