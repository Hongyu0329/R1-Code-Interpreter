    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     C T K\n     Y H F\n     O N O\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix. Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Original Matrix**:\n     ```\n     C T K\n     Y H F\n     O N O\n     ```\n   - **Rotated Matrix**:\n     - The first row `C T K` becomes the last column:\n       ```\n       O\n       N\n       O\n       ```\n     - The second row `Y H F` becomes the second-to-last column:\n       ```\n       F\n       H\n       Y\n       ```\n     - The third row `O N O` becomes the first column:\n       ```\n       K\n       T\n       C\n       ```\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - By placing the transformed rows into columns, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     O Y C\n     N H T\n     O F K\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the rotated matrix as a list of values and symbols, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<O,Y,C,N,H,T,O,F,K>>>"
