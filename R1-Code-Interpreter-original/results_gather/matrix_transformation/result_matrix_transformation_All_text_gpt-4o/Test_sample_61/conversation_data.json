    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     G P 7 L\n     I O E 1\n     9 8 X X\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n   - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n   - Continue this pattern for all rows.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original first row: `G P 7 L` becomes the last column of the new matrix: \n     ```\n     L\n     7\n     P\n     G\n     ```\n   - Original second row: `I O E 1` becomes the second last column of the new matrix:\n     ```\n     1\n     E\n     O\n     I\n     ```\n   - Original third row: `9 8 X X` becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n     ```\n     X\n     X\n     8\n     9\n     ```\n\n6. **Construct the Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Combine the columns to form the new matrix:\n     ```\n     9 I L\n     8 O 7\n     X E P\n     X 1 G\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n<<<9,I,L,8,O,7,X,E,P,X,1,G>>>"
