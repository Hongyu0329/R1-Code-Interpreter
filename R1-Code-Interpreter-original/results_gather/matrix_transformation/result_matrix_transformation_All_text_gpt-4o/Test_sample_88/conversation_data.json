    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     $ & ! &\n     * @ % ^\n     & * @ *\n     ^ * & !\n     ```\n   - This is a 4x4 matrix (4 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     Row 0: $ & ! &\n     Row 1: * @ % ^\n     Row 2: & * @ *\n     Row 3: ^ * & !\n     ```\n\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - Column 0 (from Row 3): ^ & * $\n     - Column 1 (from Row 2): * * @ &\n     - Column 2 (from Row 1): & @ % !\n     - Column 3 (from Row 0): ! ^ & &\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     ^ & * $\n     * * @ &\n     & @ % !\n     ! ^ & &\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the rotated matrix into the specified output format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The rotated matrix in the required format is:\n     <<<^,*,&,!,&,*,@,^,*,@,%,&,!,&,!,&>>>"
