    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     ^ & @ %\n     * ! ! #\n     ! # * %\n     * $ ^ @\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix will also be 4x4 since the original matrix is square.\n   - We will construct the new matrix by taking elements from the original matrix in the following manner:\n     - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n     - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n     - Continue this pattern for all rows.\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Let's construct the new matrix step by step:\n     - First column: Take the last element of each row from the original matrix.\n       - From row 1: %, from row 2: #, from row 3: %, from row 4: @\n       - New first column: [*, !, !, ^]\n     - Second column: Take the second last element of each row from the original matrix.\n       - From row 1: @, from row 2: !, from row 3: *, from row 4: ^\n       - New second column: [$, #, !, &]\n     - Third column: Take the third last element of each row from the original matrix.\n       - From row 1: &, from row 2: !, from row 3: #, from row 4: $\n       - New third column: [^, *, !, @]\n     - Fourth column: Take the first element of each row from the original matrix.\n       - From row 1: ^, from row 2: *, from row 3: !, from row 4: *\n       - New fourth column: [@, %, #, %]\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     * ! ! ^\n     $ # ! &\n     ^ * ! @\n     @ % # %\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - According to the required format, we need to output the matrix as a list of values and symbols.\n   - The output should be: <<<*,!,!,^,$,#,!,&,^,*,!,@,@,%,#,%%>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<*,!,!,^,$,#,!,&,^,*,!,@,@,%,#,%%>>>"
