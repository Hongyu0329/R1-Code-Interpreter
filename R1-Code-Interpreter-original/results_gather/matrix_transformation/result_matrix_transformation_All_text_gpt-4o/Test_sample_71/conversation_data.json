    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns):\n     ```\n     L G J M\n     B I F K\n     F 7 R 3\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n   - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n   - The third column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n   - The fourth column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Construction**:\n   - Original first row: `L G J M` becomes the last column: `M K 3`\n   - Original second row: `B I F K` becomes the second last column: `J F R`\n   - Original third row: `F 7 R 3` becomes the second column: `G I 7`\n   - Original fourth row: `M K 3` becomes the first column: `L B F`\n\n6. **Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will look like this:\n     ```\n     F B L\n     7 I G\n     R F J\n     3 K M\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<F,7,R,3,B,I,F,K,L,G,J,M>>>"
