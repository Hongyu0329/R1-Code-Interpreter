    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Structure**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     B S N\n     S O B\n     I P I\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element:\n     - The first row `B S N` becomes the last column:\n       - `B` (0,0) moves to (0,2)\n       - `S` (0,1) moves to (1,2)\n       - `N` (0,2) moves to (2,2)\n     - The second row `S O B` becomes the second column:\n       - `S` (1,0) moves to (0,1)\n       - `O` (1,1) moves to (1,1)\n       - `B` (1,2) moves to (2,1)\n     - The third row `I P I` becomes the first column:\n       - `I` (2,0) moves to (0,0)\n       - `P` (2,1) moves to (1,0)\n       - `I` (2,2) moves to (2,0)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     I S B\n     P O S\n     I B N\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - According to the required format, we need to output the matrix as a list of values and symbols within `<<< >>>`.\n   - The matrix should be read row by row and converted into a single list.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The rotated matrix in the required format is:\n     <<<I,S,B,P,O,S,I,B,N>>>"
