    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 9 4\n     8 2 1\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Rotating a 2x3 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix `matrix[i][j]`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     5 9 4\n     8 2 1\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - The first row `[5, 9, 4]` becomes the last column:\n       ```\n       8 5\n       2 9\n       1 4\n       ```\n     - The second row `[8, 2, 1]` becomes the first column:\n       ```\n       8 5\n       2 9\n       1 4\n       ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 5\n     2 9\n     1 4\n     ```\n   - Convert this matrix into the specified output format: <<<8,5,2,9,1,4>>>.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully rotated the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and formatted the result as required.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<8,5,2,9,1,4>>>"
