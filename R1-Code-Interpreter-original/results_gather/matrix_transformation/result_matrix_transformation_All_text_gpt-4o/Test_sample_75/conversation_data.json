    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     N 8 C 3\n     C L 2 L\n     N B L W\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n   - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n   - The third column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n   - Therefore, the transformation is as follows:\n     - First column of new matrix: N, C, N\n     - Second column of new matrix: 8, L, B\n     - Third column of new matrix: C, 2, L\n     - Fourth column of new matrix: 3, L, W\n\n5. **Construct the Result**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     N C N\n     8 L B\n     C 2 L\n     3 L W\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The matrix should be read row by row and formatted into a single list.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<N,C,N,8,L,B,C,2,L,3,L,W>>>"
