    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     2 J C 3\n     E 9 Y A\n     W E A V\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Start with the last row of the original matrix and make it the first column of the new matrix.\n   - Continue this process for each row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     2 J C 3\n     E 9 Y A\n     W E A V\n     ```\n   - New matrix after 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n     - First column: W, E, 2\n     - Second column: E, 9, J\n     - Third column: A, Y, C\n     - Fourth column: V, A, 3\n\n6. **Format the Result**:\n   - The new matrix is:\n     ```\n     W E 2\n     E 9 J\n     A Y C\n     V A 3\n     ```\n   - Convert this matrix into the specified format: <<<W,E,2,E,9,J,A,Y,C,V,A,3>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully rotated the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and formatted the result as required.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<W,E,2,E,9,J,A,Y,C,V,A,3>>>"
