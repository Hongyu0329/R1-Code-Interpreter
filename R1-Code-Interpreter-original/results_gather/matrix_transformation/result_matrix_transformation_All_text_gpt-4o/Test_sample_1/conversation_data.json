    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     V C\n     Y E\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix:**\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) in the original matrix moves to position (0,1) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at position (0,1) in the original matrix moves to position (1,1) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,0) in the original matrix moves to position (0,0) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,1) in the original matrix moves to position (1,0) in the new matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation:**\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     V C\n     Y E\n     ```\n   - New matrix after 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n     ```\n     Y V\n     E C\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The result should be formatted as a list of values and symbols, representing the new 2D array.\n   - The new matrix is:\n     ```\n     Y V\n     E C\n     ```\n   - Therefore, the formatted output is: <<<Y,E,V,C>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully rotated the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and formatted the result as required.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Y,E,V,C>>>"
