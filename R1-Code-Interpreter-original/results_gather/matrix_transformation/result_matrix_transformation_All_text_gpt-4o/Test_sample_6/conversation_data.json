    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     F J\n     U T\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that:\n     - The first row becomes the last column.\n     - The second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as:\n     - The element at position (0,0) moves to position (0,1).\n     - The element at position (0,1) moves to position (1,1).\n     - The element at position (1,0) moves to position (0,0).\n     - The element at position (1,1) moves to position (1,0).\n\n4. **Perform the Transformation:**\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     F J\n     U T\n     ```\n   - After rotation:\n     - The element 'F' at (0,0) moves to (0,1).\n     - The element 'J' at (0,1) moves to (1,1).\n     - The element 'U' at (1,0) moves to (0,0).\n     - The element 'T' at (1,1) moves to (1,0).\n\n   - The resulting matrix after rotation is:\n     ```\n     U F\n     T J\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The rotated matrix is represented as a list of values in row-major order: U, F, T, J.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<U,F,T,J>>>"
