    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n   - The matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 P T D\n     7 L L 4\n     P C O S\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns.\n   - The first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix will have dimensions 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n   - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n   - Continue this process for all rows of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original first row: `6 P T D`\n     - Becomes the last column of the new matrix: \n       ```\n       D\n       T\n       P\n       6\n       ```\n   - Original second row: `7 L L 4`\n     - Becomes the second last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       4\n       L\n       L\n       7\n       ```\n   - Original third row: `P C O S`\n     - Becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       S\n       O\n       C\n       P\n       ```\n\n6. **Construct the Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Combine the columns to form the new matrix:\n     ```\n     P 7 6\n     C L P\n     O L T\n     S 4 D\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified output format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n<<<P,7,6,C,L,P,O,L,T,S,4,D>>>"
