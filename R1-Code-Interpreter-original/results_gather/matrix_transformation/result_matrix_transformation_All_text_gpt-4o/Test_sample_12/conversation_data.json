    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     L U\n     X K\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) (L) moves to position (0,1).\n     - The element at position (0,1) (U) moves to position (1,1).\n     - The element at position (1,0) (X) moves to position (0,0).\n     - The element at position (1,1) (K) moves to position (1,0).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     X L\n     K U\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - For the rotated matrix, the output should be formatted as: <<<X,L,K,U>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the matrix is correctly rotated and formatted according to the problem's requirements.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<X,L,K,U>>>"
