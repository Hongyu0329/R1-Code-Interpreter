    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     R G J\n     Z U L\n     K S V\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Start with the first row of the original matrix: `R G J`\n     - This becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? ? R\n       ? ? G\n       ? ? J\n       ```\n   - Move to the second row of the original matrix: `Z U L`\n     - This becomes the second-to-last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? Z R\n       ? U G\n       ? L J\n       ```\n   - Finally, take the third row of the original matrix: `K S V`\n     - This becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       K Z R\n       S U G\n       V L J\n       ```\n\n4. **Construct the Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     K Z R\n     S U G\n     V L J\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n     <<<K,Z,R,S,U,G,V,L,J>>>\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<K,Z,R,S,U,G,V,L,J>>>"
