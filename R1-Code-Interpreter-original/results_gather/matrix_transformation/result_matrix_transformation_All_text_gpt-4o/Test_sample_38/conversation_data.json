    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 1 3\n     4 7 1\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - Rotating a 2x3 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic:**\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix `matrix[i][j]`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     4 1 3\n     4 7 1\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - The first row `4 1 3` becomes the last column:\n       ```\n       4\n       1\n       3\n       ```\n     - The second row `4 7 1` becomes the first column:\n       ```\n       4\n       7\n       1\n       ```\n   - Therefore, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 4\n     7 1\n     1 3\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the rotated matrix as a list of values and symbols, as specified in the problem statement.\n   - The matrix `4 4, 7 1, 1 3` should be represented as:\n     ```\n     <<<4,4,7,1,1,3>>>\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully rotated the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and formatted the output as required.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<4,4,7,1,1,3>>>"
