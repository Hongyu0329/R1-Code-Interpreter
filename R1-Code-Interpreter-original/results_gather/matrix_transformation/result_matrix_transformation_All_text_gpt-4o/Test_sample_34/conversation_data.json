    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array (matrix) 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 4 8\n     4 5 4\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, a 2x3 matrix will become a 3x2 matrix.\n\n4. **Perform the Rotation**:\n   - Start with the first row of the original matrix: `8 4 8`.\n     - This will become the last column of the new matrix.\n   - Next, take the second row of the original matrix: `4 5 4`.\n     - This will become the first column of the new matrix.\n\n5. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix will be constructed as follows:\n     - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix: `4 5 4`.\n     - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix: `8 4 8`.\n\n6. **Resulting Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix after rotation will be:\n     ```\n     4 8\n     5 4\n     4 8\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - According to the required format, we need to output the matrix as a list of values and symbols, separated by commas and enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - The rotated matrix in the specified format is: `<<<4,8,5,4,4,8>>>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<4,8,5,4,4,8>>>"
