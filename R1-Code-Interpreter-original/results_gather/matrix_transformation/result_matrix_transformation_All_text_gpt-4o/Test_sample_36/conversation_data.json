    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 9 1\n     3 8 3\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - Rotating a 2x3 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic:**\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, it will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     Row 0: 8 9 1\n     Row 1: 3 8 3\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix: [3, 8].\n     - The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix: [8, 9].\n     - The third column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix: [3, 1].\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     3 8\n     8 9\n     3 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output:**\n   - Convert the rotated matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The rotated matrix in the specified format is: <<<3,8,8,9,3,1>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<3,8,8,9,3,1>>>"
