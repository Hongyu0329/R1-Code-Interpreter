    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     7 1 2\n     7 8 9\n     ```\n   - This matrix can be represented as a 2D array:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"7\", \"1\", \"2\"],\n       [\"7\", \"8\", \"9\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions**:\n   - The matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - When rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - For a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the rotated matrix will have dimensions `n x m`.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will have 3 rows and 2 columns.\n   - The transformation can be described as follows:\n     - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, m-1-i) in the rotated matrix.\n\n5. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"7\", \"1\", \"2\"],\n       [\"7\", \"8\", \"9\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - First column of the rotated matrix: [\"7\", \"7\"]\n     - Second column of the rotated matrix: [\"1\", \"8\"]\n     - Third column of the rotated matrix: [\"2\", \"9\"]\n   - Therefore, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"7\", \"7\"],\n       [\"1\", \"8\"],\n       [\"2\", \"9\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the rotated matrix into the specified output format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The rotated matrix in the required format is: <<<7,7,1,8,2,9>>>\n\nFinal Answer: <<<7,7,1,8,2,9>>>"
