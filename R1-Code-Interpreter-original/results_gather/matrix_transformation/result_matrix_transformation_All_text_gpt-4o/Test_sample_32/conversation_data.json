    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 2 6\n     8 6 8\n     ```\n   - This can be represented as a 2D array:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"5\", \"2\", \"6\"],\n       [\"8\", \"6\", \"8\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions**:\n   - The matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - When rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - For a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the rotated matrix will have dimensions `n x m`.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n   - The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"5\", \"2\", \"6\"],\n       [\"8\", \"6\", \"8\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - First column: [\"8\", \"5\"]\n     - Second column: [\"6\", \"2\"]\n     - Third column: [\"8\", \"6\"]\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"8\", \"5\"],\n       [\"6\", \"2\"],\n       [\"8\", \"6\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Convert this to the specified output format: <<<8,5,6,2,8,6>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the matrix is correctly rotated and formatted as required.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<8,5,6,2,8,6>>>"
