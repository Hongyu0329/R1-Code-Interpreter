    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     G Y Z\n     A A A\n     U B Y\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Start with the first row of the original matrix: `G Y Z`\n     - This becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? ? G\n       ? ? Y\n       ? ? Z\n       ```\n   - Move to the second row of the original matrix: `A A A`\n     - This becomes the second column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? A G\n       ? A Y\n       ? A Z\n       ```\n   - Finally, take the third row of the original matrix: `U B Y`\n     - This becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       U A G\n       B A Y\n       Y A Z\n       ```\n\n4. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Ensure that each element from the original matrix is correctly placed in the new matrix according to the 90-degree clockwise rotation rule.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     U A G\n     B A Y\n     Y A Z\n     ```\n   - Convert this matrix into the specified output format: <<<U,A,G,B,A,Y,Y,A,Z>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the matrix is correctly rotated and formatted as required.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<U,A,G,B,A,Y,Y,A,Z>>>"
