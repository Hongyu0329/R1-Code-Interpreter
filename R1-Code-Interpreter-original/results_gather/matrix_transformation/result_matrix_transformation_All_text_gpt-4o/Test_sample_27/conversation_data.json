    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     1 4 3\n     6 8 7\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - Rotating a 2x3 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic:**\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, it will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     1 4 3\n     6 8 7\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - The first row of the original matrix `[1, 4, 3]` becomes the last column of the rotated matrix:\n       ```\n       6 1\n       8 4\n       7 3\n       ```\n     - The second row of the original matrix `[6, 8, 7]` becomes the first column of the rotated matrix.\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 1\n     8 4\n     7 3\n     ```\n   - We need to format this as a list of values and symbols, separated by commas, enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The formatted output for the rotated matrix is: `<<<6,1,8,4,7,3>>>`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<6,1,8,4,7,3>>>"
