    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n   - Matrix:\n     ```\n     R 7 I S\n     S K C A\n     1 1 S E\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns.\n   - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Start with the last row of the original matrix and make it the first column of the new matrix.\n   - Continue this process for each row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original Matrix:\n     ```\n     R 7 I S\n     S K C A\n     1 1 S E\n     ```\n   - New Matrix after 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n     - First column: 1, S, R\n     - Second column: 1, K, 7\n     - Third column: S, C, I\n     - Fourth column: E, A, S\n\n6. **Resulting Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix after rotation is:\n     ```\n     1 S R\n     1 K 7\n     S C I\n     E A S\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<1,S,R,1,K,7,S,C,I,E,A,S>>>"
