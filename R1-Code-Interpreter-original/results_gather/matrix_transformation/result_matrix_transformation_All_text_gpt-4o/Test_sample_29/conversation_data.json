    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 2 7\n     7 8 6\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Rotating a 2x3 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, it will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     [4, 2, 7]\n     [7, 8, 6]\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - First column of the rotated matrix (from the last row of the original matrix):\n       - [7, 4]\n     - Second column of the rotated matrix (from the second-to-last row of the original matrix):\n       - [8, 2]\n     - Third column of the rotated matrix (from the first row of the original matrix):\n       - [6, 7]\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     [7, 4]\n     [8, 2]\n     [6, 7]\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the rotated matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The values should be listed in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom).\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The formatted output for the rotated matrix is: <<<7,4,8,2,6,7>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<7,4,8,2,6,7>>>"
