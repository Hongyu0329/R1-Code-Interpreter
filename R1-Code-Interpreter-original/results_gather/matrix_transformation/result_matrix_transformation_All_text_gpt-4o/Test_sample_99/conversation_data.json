    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     @ ^ * !\n     # # ! @\n     # # & $\n     * ^ $ %\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix. Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Original Matrix**:\n     ```\n     Row 1: @ ^ * !\n     Row 2: # # ! @\n     Row 3: # # & $\n     Row 4: * ^ $ %\n     ```\n   - **New Matrix Construction**:\n     - **Column 1** (from last row to first row of original matrix): * # # @\n     - **Column 2** (from last row to first row of original matrix): ^ # # ^\n     - **Column 3** (from last row to first row of original matrix): $ & ! *\n     - **Column 4** (from last row to first row of original matrix): % $ @ !\n\n4. **Resulting Matrix**:\n   - After rotating, the new matrix is:\n     ```\n     * # # @\n     ^ # # ^\n     $ & ! *\n     % $ @ !\n     ```\n\n5. **Formatting the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>. Each row of the matrix should be listed in sequence.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n     <<<*,#, #,@,^,#,#,^,$,&,!,*,%, $, @, !>>>"
