    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     % % ^ *\n     # & ^ &\n     @ @ @ ^\n     ^ ! @ $\n     ```\n   - This is a 4x4 matrix (4 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n\n   - **First Row**: `% % ^ *`\n     - `%` at (0,0) moves to (0,3)\n     - `%` at (0,1) moves to (1,3)\n     - `^` at (0,2) moves to (2,3)\n     - `*` at (0,3) moves to (3,3)\n\n   - **Second Row**: `# & ^ &`\n     - `#` at (1,0) moves to (0,2)\n     - `&` at (1,1) moves to (1,2)\n     - `^` at (1,2) moves to (2,2)\n     - `&` at (1,3) moves to (3,2)\n\n   - **Third Row**: `@ @ @ ^`\n     - `@` at (2,0) moves to (0,1)\n     - `@` at (2,1) moves to (1,1)\n     - `@` at (2,2) moves to (2,1)\n     - `^` at (2,3) moves to (3,1)\n\n   - **Fourth Row**: `^ ! @ $`\n     - `^` at (3,0) moves to (0,0)\n     - `!` at (3,1) moves to (1,0)\n     - `@` at (3,2) moves to (2,0)\n     - `$` at (3,3) moves to (3,0)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     ^ @ # %\n     ! @ & %\n     @ @ ^ ^\n     $ ^ & *\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - Therefore, the rotated matrix should be represented as:\n     <<<^,@,#,%,!,@,&,%,@,@,^,^,$,^,&,*>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<^,@,#,%,!,@,&,%,@,@,^,^,$,^,&,*>>>"
