    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Structure**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     C Z\n     I U\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix with two rows and two columns.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) (first row, first column) moves to position (0,1) (first row, second column).\n     - The element at position (0,1) (first row, second column) moves to position (1,1) (second row, second column).\n     - The element at position (1,0) (second row, first column) moves to position (0,0) (first row, first column).\n     - The element at position (1,1) (second row, second column) moves to position (1,0) (second row, first column).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Using the above logic, we can map the elements from the original matrix to their new positions in the rotated matrix:\n     - Original (0,0) 'C' moves to New (0,1)\n     - Original (0,1) 'Z' moves to New (1,1)\n     - Original (1,0) 'I' moves to New (0,0)\n     - Original (1,1) 'U' moves to New (1,0)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the transformations, the rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     I C\n     U Z\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the rotated matrix as a list of values and symbols, as specified in the problem statement. The matrix should be represented as a single list, row by row.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<I,C,U,Z>>>"
