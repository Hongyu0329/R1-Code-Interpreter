    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     A J X X\n     9 S 4 7\n     R X V T\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - We will create a new matrix where:\n     - The first column of the new matrix is the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n     - The second column of the new matrix is the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n     - The third column of the new matrix is the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n     - The fourth column of the new matrix is the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original first row: `A J X X` becomes the last column: `X 7 T`\n   - Original second row: `9 S 4 7` becomes the second last column: `X 4 V`\n   - Original third row: `R X V T` becomes the third last column: `J S X`\n   - The new first column is formed by the first elements of each row in reverse order: `A 9 R`\n\n6. **Construct the Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     R 9 A\n     X S J\n     V 4 X\n     T 7 X\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<R,9,A,X,S,J,V,4,X,T,7,X>>>"
