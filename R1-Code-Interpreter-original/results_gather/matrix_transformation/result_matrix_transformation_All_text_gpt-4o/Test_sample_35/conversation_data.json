    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 3 3\n     3 5 1\n     ```\n   - This matrix can be represented as a 2D array:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"4\", \"3\", \"3\"],\n       [\"3\", \"5\", \"1\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions**:\n   - The matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - When rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - For a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the rotated matrix will have dimensions `n x m`.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will have 3 rows and 2 columns.\n   - The transformation can be described as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) in the original matrix moves to position (0,1) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at position (0,1) in the original matrix moves to position (1,1) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at position (0,2) in the original matrix moves to position (2,1) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,0) in the original matrix moves to position (0,0) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,1) in the original matrix moves to position (1,0) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,2) in the original matrix moves to position (2,0) in the rotated matrix.\n\n5. **Fill the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Based on the above transformation, the rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"3\", \"4\"],\n       [\"5\", \"3\"],\n       [\"1\", \"3\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The rotated matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<3,4,5,3,1,3>>>"
