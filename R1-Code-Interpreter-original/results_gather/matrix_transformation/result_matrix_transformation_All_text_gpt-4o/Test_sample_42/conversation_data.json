    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     S L D\n     R I S\n     K F L\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Original Matrix**:\n     ```\n     Row 1: S L D\n     Row 2: R I S\n     Row 3: K F L\n     ```\n   - **Rotated Matrix**:\n     - The first row `S L D` becomes the last column:\n       ```\n       Column 3: S\n                 L\n                 D\n       ```\n     - The second row `R I S` becomes the second column:\n       ```\n       Column 2: R\n                 I\n                 S\n       ```\n     - The third row `K F L` becomes the first column:\n       ```\n       Column 1: K\n                 F\n                 L\n       ```\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - By combining the new columns, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     K R S\n     F I L\n     L S D\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the rotated matrix as a list of values and symbols, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<K,R,S,F,I,L,L,S,D>>>"
