    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     E N\n     Y J\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - Rotating a 2x2 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in another 2x2 matrix.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic:**\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, n = 2.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - Let's apply the rotation to each element:\n     - The element at (0, 0) is 'E'. It moves to (0, 1).\n     - The element at (0, 1) is 'N'. It moves to (1, 1).\n     - The element at (1, 0) is 'Y'. It moves to (0, 0).\n     - The element at (1, 1) is 'J'. It moves to (1, 0).\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     Y E\n     J N\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The rotated matrix should be represented as <<<Y,E,J,N>>>.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully rotated the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and formatted the output as required.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<Y,E,J,N>>>"
