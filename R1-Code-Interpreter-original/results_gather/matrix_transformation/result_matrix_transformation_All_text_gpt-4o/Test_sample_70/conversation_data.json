    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Mapping Elements**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n5. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\n   Original Matrix:\n   ```\n   O U Y 1\n   T 9 Q W\n   Y 8 Z D\n   ```\n\n   - First row \"O U Y 1\" becomes the last column:\n     - O -> (0, 2)\n     - U -> (1, 2)\n     - Y -> (2, 2)\n     - 1 -> (3, 2)\n\n   - Second row \"T 9 Q W\" becomes the second last column:\n     - T -> (0, 1)\n     - 9 -> (1, 1)\n     - Q -> (2, 1)\n     - W -> (3, 1)\n\n   - Third row \"Y 8 Z D\" becomes the first column:\n     - Y -> (0, 0)\n     - 8 -> (1, 0)\n     - Z -> (2, 0)\n     - D -> (3, 0)\n\n6. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     Y T O\n     8 9 U\n     Z Q Y\n     D W 1\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<Y,8,Z,D,T,9,Q,W,O,U,Y,1>>>"
