    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     F M R\n     M Q W\n     H S C\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element:\n     - The first row `F M R` becomes the last column:\n       - `F` moves to (0, 2)\n       - `M` moves to (1, 2)\n       - `R` moves to (2, 2)\n     - The second row `M Q W` becomes the second column:\n       - `M` moves to (0, 1)\n       - `Q` moves to (1, 1)\n       - `W` moves to (2, 1)\n     - The third row `H S C` becomes the first column:\n       - `H` moves to (0, 0)\n       - `S` moves to (1, 0)\n       - `C` moves to (2, 0)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     H M F\n     S Q M\n     C W R\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<H,M,F,S,Q,M,C,W,R>>>"
