    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     * % % ^\n     & % @ @\n     ^ & ! @\n     @ $ ! !\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - For a matrix element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position after a 90-degree clockwise rotation will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n     - The first row `[* % % ^]` becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       @\n       ^\n       &\n       *\n       ```\n     - The second row `[& % @ @]` becomes the third column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       $\n       &\n       %\n       %\n       ```\n     - The third row `[^ & ! @]` becomes the second column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       !\n       !\n       @\n       %\n       ```\n     - The fourth row `[@ $ ! !]` becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       !\n       @\n       @\n       ^\n       ```\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - By arranging the new columns together, we get the rotated matrix:\n     ```\n     @ & ^ *\n     $ % & %\n     ! @ ! %\n     ! @ @ ^\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is represented as:\n<<<@,$,!,!,&,%,@,$,^,&,!,@,*,%,%,^>>>"
