    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     Z C\n     R U\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - Rotating a 2x2 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in another 2x2 matrix.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic:**\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, n = 2.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - Let's apply the rotation to each element:\n     - The element at (0, 0) in the original matrix is 'Z'. It moves to (0, 1) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at (0, 1) in the original matrix is 'C'. It moves to (1, 1) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at (1, 0) in the original matrix is 'R'. It moves to (0, 0) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at (1, 1) in the original matrix is 'U'. It moves to (1, 0) in the new matrix.\n\n5. **Construct the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - After applying the above transformations, the new matrix is:\n     ```\n     R Z\n     U C\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The resulting matrix should be represented as <<<R,Z,U,C>>>.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is represented as:\n\n<<<R,Z,U,C>>>"
