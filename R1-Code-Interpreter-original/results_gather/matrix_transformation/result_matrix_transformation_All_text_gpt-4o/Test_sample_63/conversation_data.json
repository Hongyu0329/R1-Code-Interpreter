    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     3  X  S  N\n     3  D  L  O\n     B  6  C  3\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Start with an empty 4x3 matrix.\n   - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n   - The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n   - Continue this process for all rows.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original first row: `3 X S N` becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n   - Original second row: `3 D L O` becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n   - Original third row: `B 6 C 3` becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n\n6. **Fill the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix will be filled as follows:\n     - First column: `B 3 3`\n     - Second column: `6 D X`\n     - Third column: `C L S`\n     - Fourth column: `3 O N`\n\n7. **Resulting Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     B  3  3\n     6  D  X\n     C  L  S\n     3  O  N\n     ```\n\n8. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<B,3,3,6,D,X,C,L,S,3,O,N>>>"
