    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     Z P E\n     Z T V\n     G I V\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Identify the Transformation**:\n   - For a 3x3 matrix, the transformation can be described as follows:\n     - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n     - Original first row: `Z P E` becomes the last column of the new matrix: \n       - `Z` goes to (0, 2)\n       - `P` goes to (1, 2)\n       - `E` goes to (2, 2)\n     - Original second row: `Z T V` becomes the second column of the new matrix:\n       - `Z` goes to (0, 1)\n       - `T` goes to (1, 1)\n       - `V` goes to (2, 1)\n     - Original third row: `G I V` becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       - `G` goes to (0, 0)\n       - `I` goes to (1, 0)\n       - `V` goes to (2, 0)\n\n5. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - After applying the transformation, the new matrix is:\n     ```\n     G Z Z\n     I T P\n     V V E\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is represented as:\n<<<G,Z,Z,I,T,P,V,V,E>>>"
