    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     J T\n     U B\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions:**\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) (J) moves to position (0,1).\n     - The element at position (0,1) (T) moves to position (1,1).\n     - The element at position (1,0) (U) moves to position (0,0).\n     - The element at position (1,1) (B) moves to position (1,0).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     U J\n     B T\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The elements of the rotated matrix should be listed in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom).\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - The rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n     <<<U,J,B,T>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<U,J,B,T>>>"
