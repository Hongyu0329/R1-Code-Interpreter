    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x4 matrix (5 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix will have dimensions of 4x5 (4 rows and 5 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Start with an empty 4x5 matrix.\n   - For each element in the original matrix at position (i, j), place it in the new matrix at position (j, 4-i-1).\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original Matrix:\n     ```\n     * $ # ^\n     ! * * &\n     # * % @\n     % @ % #\n     ```\n   - New Matrix Construction:\n     - First column of the new matrix (from the last row of the original matrix):\n       - New[0][0] = Original[4][0] = %\n       - New[1][0] = Original[3][0] = #\n       - New[2][0] = Original[2][0] = #\n       - New[3][0] = Original[1][0] = !\n       - New[4][0] = Original[0][0] = *\n     - Second column of the new matrix (from the second last row of the original matrix):\n       - New[0][1] = Original[4][1] = @\n       - New[1][1] = Original[3][1] = *\n       - New[2][1] = Original[2][1] = *\n       - New[3][1] = Original[1][1] = *\n       - New[4][1] = Original[0][1] = $\n     - Third column of the new matrix (from the third last row of the original matrix):\n       - New[0][2] = Original[4][2] = %\n       - New[1][2] = Original[3][2] = %\n       - New[2][2] = Original[2][2] = %\n       - New[3][2] = Original[1][2] = *\n       - New[4][2] = Original[0][2] = #\n     - Fourth column of the new matrix (from the fourth last row of the original matrix):\n       - New[0][3] = Original[4][3] = #\n       - New[1][3] = Original[3][3] = @\n       - New[2][3] = Original[2][3] = @\n       - New[3][3] = Original[1][3] = &\n       - New[4][3] = Original[0][3] = ^\n   \n6. **Final Result**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     % @ % #\n     # * % @\n     # * % @\n     ! * * &\n     * $ # ^\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<%,@,%,#, #,*,%,@, #,*,%,@, !,*,*,&, *, $, #, ^>>>"
