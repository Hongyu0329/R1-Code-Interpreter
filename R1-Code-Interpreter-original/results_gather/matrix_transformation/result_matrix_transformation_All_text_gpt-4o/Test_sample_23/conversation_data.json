    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 3 2\n     6 3 1\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Rotating a 2x3 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     8 3 2\n     6 3 1\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - First column of the rotated matrix (from top to bottom) will be the second row of the original matrix (from left to right): 6, 3, 1.\n     - Second column of the rotated matrix (from top to bottom) will be the first row of the original matrix (from left to right): 8, 3, 2.\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     6 8\n     3 3\n     1 2\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the rotated matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The rotated matrix in the specified format is: <<<6,8,3,3,1,2>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<6,8,3,3,1,2>>>"
