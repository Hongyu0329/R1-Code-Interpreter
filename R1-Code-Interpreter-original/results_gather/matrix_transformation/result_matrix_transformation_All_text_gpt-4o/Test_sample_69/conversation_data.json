    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n   - The matrix is:\n     ```\n     G 6 B H\n     K Q 3 7\n     7 2 H 4\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Resulting Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Let's apply this logic to the given matrix:\n     - Original first row: `G 6 B H` becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n     - Original second row: `K Q 3 7` becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n     - Original third row: `7 2 H 4` becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n\n5. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix after rotation will be:\n     ```\n     7 K G\n     2 Q 6\n     H 3 B\n     4 7 H\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<7,K,G,2,Q,6,H,3,B,4,7,H>>>"
