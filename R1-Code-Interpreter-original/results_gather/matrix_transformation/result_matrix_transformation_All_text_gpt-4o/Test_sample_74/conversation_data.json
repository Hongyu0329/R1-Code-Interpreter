    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     T S I X\n     5 5 3 E\n     I S 7 H\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Start with an empty 4x3 matrix.\n   - Fill the new matrix by taking elements from the original matrix:\n     - The first column of the new matrix will be the reversed first row of the original matrix.\n     - The second column of the new matrix will be the reversed second row of the original matrix.\n     - The third column of the new matrix will be the reversed third row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     T S I X\n     5 5 3 E\n     I S 7 H\n     ```\n   - New matrix after rotation:\n     - First column: I, 5, T (from the last element of each row of the original matrix)\n     - Second column: S, 5, S\n     - Third column: 7, 3, I\n     - Fourth column: H, E, X\n\n6. **Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     I 5 T\n     S 5 S\n     7 3 I\n     H E X\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<I,5,T,S,5,S,7,3,I,H,E,X>>>"
