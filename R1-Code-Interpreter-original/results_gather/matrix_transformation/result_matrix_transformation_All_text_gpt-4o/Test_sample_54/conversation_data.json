    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     W V Z\n     P P X\n     O J V\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix (3 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise means that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Let's apply this to each element:\n     - The first row `W V Z` becomes the last column:\n       - `W` moves to position (0, 2)\n       - `V` moves to position (1, 2)\n       - `Z` moves to position (2, 2)\n     - The second row `P P X` becomes the second column:\n       - `P` moves to position (0, 1)\n       - `P` moves to position (1, 1)\n       - `X` moves to position (2, 1)\n     - The third row `O J V` becomes the first column:\n       - `O` moves to position (0, 0)\n       - `J` moves to position (1, 0)\n       - `V` moves to position (2, 0)\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     O P W\n     J P V\n     V X Z\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<O,P,W,J,P,V,V,X,Z>>>"
