    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     Q P K\n     B Z I\n     P H Y\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n     - Original first row: Q P K\n       - Q moves to (0, 2)\n       - P moves to (1, 2)\n       - K moves to (2, 2)\n     - Original second row: B Z I\n       - B moves to (0, 1)\n       - Z moves to (1, 1)\n       - I moves to (2, 1)\n     - Original third row: P H Y\n       - P moves to (0, 0)\n       - H moves to (1, 0)\n       - Y moves to (2, 0)\n\n5. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - After applying the transformation, the new matrix will be:\n     ```\n     P B Q\n     H Z P\n     Y I K\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<P,B,Q,H,Z,P,Y,I,K>>>"
