    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array (or matrix) 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns):\n     ```\n     6 1 7\n     9 5 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - When a matrix is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the number of rows in the original matrix becomes the number of columns in the rotated matrix, and the number of columns in the original matrix becomes the number of rows in the rotated matrix.\n   - Therefore, the rotated matrix will be a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - To rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of columns in the original matrix.\n   - For the given matrix:\n     - The element at (0, 0) in the original matrix (value 6) will move to (0, 1) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at (0, 1) in the original matrix (value 1) will move to (1, 1) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at (0, 2) in the original matrix (value 7) will move to (2, 1) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at (1, 0) in the original matrix (value 9) will move to (0, 0) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at (1, 1) in the original matrix (value 5) will move to (1, 0) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at (1, 2) in the original matrix (value 1) will move to (2, 0) in the rotated matrix.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the rotation logic, the rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     9 6\n     5 1\n     1 7\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The rotated matrix should be represented as a single list of values, row by row.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9,6,5,1,1,7>>>"
