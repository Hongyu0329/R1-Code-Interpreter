    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     M X\n     B U\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions:**\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) (first row, first column) moves to position (0,1) (first row, second column).\n     - The element at position (0,1) (first row, second column) moves to position (1,1) (second row, second column).\n     - The element at position (1,0) (second row, first column) moves to position (0,0) (first row, first column).\n     - The element at position (1,1) (second row, second column) moves to position (1,0) (second row, first column).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation:**\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     M X\n     B U\n     ```\n   - After rotation, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     B M\n     U X\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the rotated matrix as a list of values and symbols, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the rotated matrix and format it correctly.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B,M,U,X>>>"
