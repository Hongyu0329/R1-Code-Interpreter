    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     7 4 6\n     6 9 4\n     ```\n   - This matrix can be represented as a 2D array:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"7\", \"4\", \"6\"],\n       [\"6\", \"9\", \"4\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions**:\n   - The matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - When rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - For a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the rotated matrix will have dimensions `n x m`.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will have 3 rows and 2 columns.\n   - The transformation can be described as follows:\n     - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, m-1-i) in the rotated matrix.\n\n5. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"7\", \"4\", \"6\"],\n       [\"6\", \"9\", \"4\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - First column of the rotated matrix: [\"6\", \"7\"]\n     - Second column of the rotated matrix: [\"9\", \"4\"]\n     - Third column of the rotated matrix: [\"4\", \"6\"]\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"6\", \"7\"],\n       [\"9\", \"4\"],\n       [\"4\", \"6\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Convert this matrix into the specified output format: <<<6,7,9,4,4,6>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6,7,9,4,4,6>>>"
