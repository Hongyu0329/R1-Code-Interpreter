    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     F K I\n     F Q Y\n     C I E\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Start with the first row of the original matrix: `F K I`\n     - This becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? ? F\n       ? ? K\n       ? ? I\n       ```\n   - Move to the second row of the original matrix: `F Q Y`\n     - This becomes the second-to-last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? F F\n       ? Q K\n       ? Y I\n       ```\n   - Finally, take the third row of the original matrix: `C I E`\n     - This becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       C F F\n       I Q K\n       E Y I\n       ```\n\n4. **Format the Result**:\n   - The final rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     C F F\n     I Q K\n     E Y I\n     ```\n   - Convert this matrix into the specified output format: <<<C,F,F,I,Q,K,E,Y,I>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the matrix is correctly rotated and formatted as required.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<C,F,F,I,Q,K,E,Y,I>>>"
