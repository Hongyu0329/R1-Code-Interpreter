    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     O T 4 E\n     O 4 2 K\n     D Q W Z\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Start with an empty 4x3 matrix.\n   - Fill the new matrix by taking elements from the original matrix:\n     - The first column of the new matrix is formed by the last row of the original matrix.\n     - The second column of the new matrix is formed by the second last row of the original matrix.\n     - Continue this pattern until the last column of the new matrix is formed by the first row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     O T 4 E\n     O 4 2 K\n     D Q W Z\n     ```\n   - New matrix after 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n     - First column: D, O, O\n     - Second column: Q, 4, T\n     - Third column: W, 2, 4\n     - Fourth column: Z, K, E\n\n6. **Format the Result**:\n   - The new matrix is:\n     ```\n     D O O\n     Q 4 T\n     W 2 4\n     Z K E\n     ```\n   - Convert this matrix into the required format: <<<D,Q,W,Z,O,4,2,K,O,T,4,E>>>\n\nThe final answer is: <<<D,Q,W,Z,O,4,2,K,O,T,4,E>>>"
