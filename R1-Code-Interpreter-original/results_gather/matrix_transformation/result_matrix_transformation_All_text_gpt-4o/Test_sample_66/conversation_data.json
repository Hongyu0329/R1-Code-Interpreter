    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns):\n     ```\n     9  H  B  X\n     S  X  T  6\n     U  V  N  6\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Resulting Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Let's apply this logic to the given matrix:\n     - The first row `9 H B X` becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       X\n       B\n       H\n       9\n       ```\n     - The second row `S X T 6` becomes the second last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       6\n       T\n       X\n       S\n       ```\n     - The third row `U V N 6` becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       6\n       N\n       V\n       U\n       ```\n\n5. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - By combining the columns derived from the original rows, the new matrix is:\n     ```\n     U  S  9\n     V  X  H\n     N  T  B\n     6  6  X\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using commas to separate the elements and enclosing the entire list in `<<< >>>`.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n**Answer**: <<<U,V,N,6,S,X,T,6,9,H,B,X>>>"
