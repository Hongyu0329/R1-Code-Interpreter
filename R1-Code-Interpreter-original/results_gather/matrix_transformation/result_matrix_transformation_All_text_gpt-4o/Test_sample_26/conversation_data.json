    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 2 9\n     9 4 7\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Rotating a 2x3 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, it will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     Row 0: 4 2 9\n     Row 1: 9 4 7\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - First column of the rotated matrix (from the last row of the original matrix):\n       - (0,0) in rotated matrix = (1,0) in original matrix = 9\n       - (1,0) in rotated matrix = (0,0) in original matrix = 4\n     - Second column of the rotated matrix (from the second-to-last row of the original matrix):\n       - (0,1) in rotated matrix = (1,1) in original matrix = 4\n       - (1,1) in rotated matrix = (0,1) in original matrix = 2\n     - Third column of the rotated matrix (from the first row of the original matrix):\n       - (0,2) in rotated matrix = (1,2) in original matrix = 7\n       - (1,2) in rotated matrix = (0,2) in original matrix = 9\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     9 4\n     4 2\n     7 9\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - According to the required format, the output should be a list of values and symbols enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n   - The final output should be formatted as: <<<9,4,4,2,7,9>>>\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<9,4,4,2,7,9>>>"
