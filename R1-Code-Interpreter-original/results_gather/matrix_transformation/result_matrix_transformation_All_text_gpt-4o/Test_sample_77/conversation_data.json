    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     X 4 2 N\n     H 1 7 2\n     M 8 K I\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - When a matrix is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the number of rows becomes the number of columns and vice versa.\n   - Therefore, the rotated matrix will be a 4x3 matrix.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - To rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n   - For this matrix, n = 3.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Let's apply the rotation to each element:\n     - First column of the original matrix becomes the last row of the rotated matrix:\n       - (0,0) -> (0,2): 'X' moves to (0,2)\n       - (1,0) -> (0,1): 'H' moves to (0,1)\n       - (2,0) -> (0,0): 'M' moves to (0,0)\n     - Second column of the original matrix becomes the second last row of the rotated matrix:\n       - (0,1) -> (1,2): '4' moves to (1,2)\n       - (1,1) -> (1,1): '1' moves to (1,1)\n       - (2,1) -> (1,0): '8' moves to (1,0)\n     - Third column of the original matrix becomes the second row of the rotated matrix:\n       - (0,2) -> (2,2): '2' moves to (2,2)\n       - (1,2) -> (2,1): '7' moves to (2,1)\n       - (2,2) -> (2,0): 'K' moves to (2,0)\n     - Fourth column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the rotated matrix:\n       - (0,3) -> (3,2): 'N' moves to (3,2)\n       - (1,3) -> (3,1): '2' moves to (3,1)\n       - (2,3) -> (3,0): 'I' moves to (3,0)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     M H X\n     8 1 4\n     K 7 2\n     I 2 N\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The formatted output for the rotated matrix is: <<<M,H,X,8,1,4,K,7,2,I,2,N>>>\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<M,H,X,8,1,4,K,7,2,I,2,N>>>"
