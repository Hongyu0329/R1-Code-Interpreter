    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns):\n     ```\n     X 5 X H\n     1 9 W K\n     4 Q K L\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Start with an empty 4x3 matrix.\n   - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n   - The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n   - Continue this process for all rows.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Original first row: `X 5 X H` becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n     ```\n     H\n     X\n     5\n     X\n     ```\n   - Original second row: `1 9 W K` becomes the second last column of the new matrix:\n     ```\n     K\n     W\n     9\n     1\n     ```\n   - Original third row: `4 Q K L` becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n     ```\n     L\n     K\n     Q\n     4\n     ```\n\n6. **Construct the Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Combine the columns to form the new matrix:\n     ```\n     4 1 X\n     Q 9 5\n     K W X\n     L K H\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n<<<4,Q,K,L,1,9,W,K,X,5,X,H>>>"
