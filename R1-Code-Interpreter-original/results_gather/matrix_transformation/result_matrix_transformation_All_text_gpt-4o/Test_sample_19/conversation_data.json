    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     W T\n     Z B\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions:**\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) in the original matrix (W) moves to position (0,1) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at position (0,1) in the original matrix (T) moves to position (1,1) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,0) in the original matrix (Z) moves to position (0,0) in the new matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,1) in the original matrix (B) moves to position (1,0) in the new matrix.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - Based on the above transformations, the rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     Z W\n     B T\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The elements of the rotated matrix should be listed in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom).\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The rotated matrix in the specified format is: <<<Z,W,B,T>>>\n\nTherefore, the result of rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise is: <<<Z,W,B,T>>>"
