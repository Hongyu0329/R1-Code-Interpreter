    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Structure**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     T K M\n     C M A\n     X U I\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Original Matrix**:\n     ```\n     Row 1: T K M\n     Row 2: C M A\n     Row 3: X U I\n     ```\n   - **New Matrix after 90-degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n     - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix: `X C T`\n     - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix: `U M K`\n     - The third column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix: `I A M`\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix, after rotation, will be:\n     ```\n     X C T\n     U M K\n     I A M\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - According to the required format, we need to list the values in a single line, separated by commas, and enclosed within `<<< >>>`.\n   - The values should be listed row by row from the new matrix.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final output, representing the rotated matrix, is:\n     ```\n     <<<X,C,T,U,M,K,I,A,M>>>\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the result of rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise is: <<<X,C,T,U,M,K,I,A,M>>>"
