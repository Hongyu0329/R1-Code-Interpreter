    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     ^ ^ @\n     @ % @ &\n     % * ^ %\n     ! ! ! *\n     ```\n   - This matrix has 4 rows and varying numbers of columns. For simplicity, let's assume the matrix is rectangular, filling missing values with spaces if necessary.\n\n2. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the number of rows in the original matrix becomes the number of columns in the rotated matrix, and vice versa.\n   - If the original matrix is 4x4 (considering the longest row), the rotated matrix will be 4x4.\n\n3. **Rotation Process**:\n   - To rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Let's apply this to the given matrix:\n     ```\n     Original Matrix:\n     Row 0: ^ ^ @\n     Row 1: @ % @ &\n     Row 2: % * ^ %\n     Row 3: ! ! ! *\n     ```\n   - Rotated Matrix:\n     - Column 0 (from bottom to top): ! % @ ^\n     - Column 1 (from bottom to top): ! * % ^\n     - Column 2 (from bottom to top): ! ^ @ @\n     - Column 3 (from bottom to top): * % &\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     ! % @ ^\n     ! * % ^\n     ! ^ @ @\n     * % &  \n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the rotated matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The final output will be: <<<!,%,@,^,!,*,%,^,!,^,@,@,*,%,&,>>>\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n<<<!,%,@,^,!,*,%,^,!,^,@,@,*,%,&,>>>"
