    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 2 8\n     2 9 7\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns).\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Rotating a 2x3 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in a 3x2 matrix (3 rows and 2 columns).\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix `matrix[i][j]`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     6 2 8\n     2 9 7\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - First column of the rotated matrix (from the last row of the original matrix):\n       - `8` (from position `(0, 2)`)\n       - `7` (from position `(1, 2)`)\n     - Second column of the rotated matrix (from the second-to-last row of the original matrix):\n       - `2` (from position `(0, 1)`)\n       - `9` (from position `(1, 1)`)\n     - Third column of the rotated matrix (from the first row of the original matrix):\n       - `6` (from position `(0, 0)`)\n       - `2` (from position `(1, 0)`)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     2 6\n     9 2\n     7 8\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output should be formatted as a list of values and symbols, representing the 2D array.\n   - Therefore, the final output is: `<<<2,6,9,2,7,8>>>`\n\nAnswer: <<<2,6,9,2,7,8>>>"
