    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     *  #  $  *\n     %  @  #  @\n     &  *  ^  %\n     ^  !  $  *\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix. Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix will also be 4x4, as the original matrix is square.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **First Column of New Matrix**: This will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n     - Original first row: `*  #  $  *`\n     - New first column: `^  &  %  *`\n   - **Second Column of New Matrix**: This will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n     - Original second row: `%  @  #  @`\n     - New second column: `!  *  @  #`\n   - **Third Column of New Matrix**: This will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n     - Original third row: `&  *  ^  %`\n     - New third column: `$  ^  #  $`\n   - **Fourth Column of New Matrix**: This will be the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix.\n     - Original fourth row: `^  !  $  *`\n     - New fourth column: `*  %  @  *`\n\n5. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - By combining the new columns, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     ^  !  $  *\n     &  *  ^  %\n     %  @  #  @\n     *  #  $  *\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final rotated matrix, formatted as required, is:\n<<<^,!,$,*,&,*,^,%,%,@,#,@,*,#,$,*>>>"
