    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     H C\n     R U\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix, meaning it has 2 rows and 2 columns.\n\n2. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - When rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as:\n     - The element at position (0,0) moves to position (0,1).\n     - The element at position (0,1) moves to position (1,1).\n     - The element at position (1,0) moves to position (0,0).\n     - The element at position (1,1) moves to position (1,0).\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     H C\n     R U\n     ```\n   - After applying the 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new positions of the elements will be:\n     ```\n     R H\n     U C\n     ```\n\n4. **Format the Result**:\n   - The result should be formatted as a list of values and symbols, representing the rotated 2D array.\n   - The elements should be listed in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom).\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     R H\n     U C\n     ```\n   - In the required format, this is represented as: <<<R,H,U,C>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<R,H,U,C>>>"
