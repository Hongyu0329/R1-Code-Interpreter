    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     U M\n     P P\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,1).\n     - The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,1).\n     - The element at position (1,0) moves to (0,0).\n     - The element at position (1,1) moves to (1,0).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     U M\n     P P\n     ```\n   - After applying the 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix will be:\n     ```\n     P U\n     P M\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     P U\n     P M\n     ```\n   - Therefore, the formatted output will be: <<<P,U,P,M>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully rotated the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and formatted the output as required.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<P,U,P,M>>>"
