    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     L A D\n     R P Z\n     H D Y\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Positions**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n     - The first row `L A D` becomes the last column:\n       - `L` moves to (0, 2)\n       - `A` moves to (1, 2)\n       - `D` moves to (2, 2)\n     - The second row `R P Z` becomes the second-to-last column:\n       - `R` moves to (0, 1)\n       - `P` moves to (1, 1)\n       - `Z` moves to (2, 1)\n     - The third row `H D Y` becomes the first column:\n       - `H` moves to (0, 0)\n       - `D` moves to (1, 0)\n       - `Y` moves to (2, 0)\n\n5. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the new matrix is:\n     ```\n     H R L\n     D P A\n     Y Z D\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - According to the required format, the output should be a list of values and symbols enclosed in `<<< >>>` and separated by commas.\n\nTherefore, the final rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n\n<<<H,R,L,D,P,A,Y,Z,D>>>"
