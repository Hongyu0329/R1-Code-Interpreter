    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     S V\n     U O\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Resulting Matrix**:\n   - Rotating a 2x2 matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in another 2x2 matrix.\n\n3. **Rotation Logic**:\n   - In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, n = 2.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Let's apply the rotation to each element:\n     - The element at (0, 0) is 'S'. It moves to (0, 1).\n     - The element at (0, 1) is 'V'. It moves to (1, 1).\n     - The element at (1, 0) is 'U'. It moves to (0, 0).\n     - The element at (1, 1) is 'O'. It moves to (1, 0).\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     U S\n     O V\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The elements of the rotated matrix are listed in row-major order: U, S, O, V.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<U,S,O,V>>>"
