    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     # ^ # #\n     % * % $\n     & ! & *\n     % & % !\n     ```\n   - This is a 4x4 matrix (4 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Transformation Process**:\n   - For a 4x4 matrix, the transformation can be described as:\n     - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n     - Original first row: `# ^ # #`\n       - Becomes the last column: \n         - `#` goes to (0, 3)\n         - `^` goes to (1, 3)\n         - `#` goes to (2, 3)\n         - `#` goes to (3, 3)\n     - Original second row: `% * % $`\n       - Becomes the second last column:\n         - `%` goes to (0, 2)\n         - `*` goes to (1, 2)\n         - `%` goes to (2, 2)\n         - `$` goes to (3, 2)\n     - Original third row: `& ! & *`\n       - Becomes the third last column:\n         - `&` goes to (0, 1)\n         - `!` goes to (1, 1)\n         - `&` goes to (2, 1)\n         - `*` goes to (3, 1)\n     - Original fourth row: `% & % !`\n       - Becomes the first column:\n         - `%` goes to (0, 0)\n         - `&` goes to (1, 0)\n         - `%` goes to (2, 0)\n         - `!` goes to (3, 0)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the transformation, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     % & # #\n     & ! ^ *\n     % & # %\n     ! * $ #\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output as specified: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - Therefore, the rotated matrix should be represented as:\n     <<<%,&,#,#, &,!,^,*, %,&,#,%, !,*, $, #>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<%,&,#,#, &,!,^,*, %,&,#,%, !,*, $, #>>>"
