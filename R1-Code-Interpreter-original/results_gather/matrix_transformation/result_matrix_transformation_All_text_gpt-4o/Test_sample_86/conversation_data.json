    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     & ! $ *\n     % % @ #\n     $ # ! *\n     & & # &\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **First Column of New Matrix**: This will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n     - Original first row: `& ! $ *`\n     - New first column: `& % $ &`\n   - **Second Column of New Matrix**: This will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n     - Original second row: `% % @ #`\n     - New second column: `! % # &`\n   - **Third Column of New Matrix**: This will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n     - Original third row: `$ # ! *`\n     - New third column: `$ @ ! #`\n   - **Fourth Column of New Matrix**: This will be the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix.\n     - Original fourth row: `& & # &`\n     - New fourth column: `* # * &`\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - By arranging the new columns as rows, we get the rotated matrix:\n     ```\n     & % $ &\n     ! % # &\n     $ @ ! #\n     * # * &\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The matrix in the required format is: <<<&,%,$,&,!,%,#,&,$,@,!,#,*,#,*,&>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<&,%,$,&,!,%,#,&,$,@,!,#,*,#,*,&>>>"
