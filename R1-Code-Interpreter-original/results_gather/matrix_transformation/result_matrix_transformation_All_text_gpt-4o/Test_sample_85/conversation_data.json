    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     @ * $ &\n     ^ $ & $\n     ! $ @ $\n     ^ * % ^\n     ```\n   - This is a 4x4 matrix (4 rows and 4 columns).\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Transformation Process**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n\n   - **First Row**: `@ * $ &`\n     - `@` moves to position (0, 3)\n     - `*` moves to position (1, 3)\n     - `$` moves to position (2, 3)\n     - `&` moves to position (3, 3)\n\n   - **Second Row**: `^ $ & $`\n     - `^` moves to position (0, 2)\n     - `$` moves to position (1, 2)\n     - `&` moves to position (2, 2)\n     - `$` moves to position (3, 2)\n\n   - **Third Row**: `! $ @ $`\n     - `!` moves to position (0, 1)\n     - `$` moves to position (1, 1)\n     - `@` moves to position (2, 1)\n     - `$` moves to position (3, 1)\n\n   - **Fourth Row**: `^ * % ^`\n     - `^` moves to position (0, 0)\n     - `*` moves to position (1, 0)\n     - `%` moves to position (2, 0)\n     - `^` moves to position (3, 0)\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the transformation, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     ^ ! ^ @\n     * $ $ *\n     % @ & $\n     ^ $ $ &\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n   - The matrix in the required format is: <<<^,!,^,@,*,$,$,*,%,@,&,$,^,$,$,&>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<^,!,^,@,*,$,$,*,%,@,&,$,^,$,$,&>>>"
