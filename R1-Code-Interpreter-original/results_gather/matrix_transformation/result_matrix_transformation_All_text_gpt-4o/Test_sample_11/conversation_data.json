    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     Z Z\n     R R\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation Concept:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that:\n     - The first row becomes the last column.\n     - The second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as:\n     - The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,1).\n     - The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,1).\n     - The element at position (1,0) moves to (0,0).\n     - The element at position (1,1) moves to (1,0).\n\n4. **Perform the Transformation:**\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     Z Z\n     R R\n     ```\n   - After applying the 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new positions of the elements will be:\n     - The first row becomes the last column: `Z R`\n     - The second row becomes the first column: `Z R`\n\n5. **Construct the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - The resulting matrix after the rotation is:\n     ```\n     Z R\n     Z R\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output:**\n   - According to the required format, the output should be a list of values and symbols enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n   - The elements should be listed in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom).\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The resulting matrix in the specified format is: `<<<Z,R,Z,R>>>`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<Z,R,Z,R>>>"
