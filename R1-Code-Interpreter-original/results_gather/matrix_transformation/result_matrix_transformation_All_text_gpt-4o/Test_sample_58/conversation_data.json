    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     D P M\n     Q J F\n     Z U V\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Start with the first row of the original matrix: `D P M`\n     - This becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? ? D\n       ? ? P\n       ? ? M\n       ```\n   - Move to the second row of the original matrix: `Q J F`\n     - This becomes the second-to-last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? Q D\n       ? J P\n       ? F M\n       ```\n   - Finally, take the third row of the original matrix: `Z U V`\n     - This becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       Z Q D\n       U J P\n       V F M\n       ```\n\n4. **Construct the Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the above transformations, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     Z Q D\n     U J P\n     V F M\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the rotated matrix as a list of values and symbols, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<Z,Q,D,U,J,P,V,F,M>>>"
