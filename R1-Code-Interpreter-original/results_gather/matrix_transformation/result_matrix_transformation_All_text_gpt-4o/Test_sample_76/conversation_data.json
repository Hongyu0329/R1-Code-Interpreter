    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns):\n     ```\n     8 W N K\n     P U F 7\n     R L 3 F\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions of 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Mapping Elements**:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\n5. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\n   - Original Matrix:\n     ```\n     Row 0: 8 W N K\n     Row 1: P U F 7\n     Row 2: R L 3 F\n     ```\n\n   - Rotated Matrix:\n     - Column 0 (from Row 2): R P 8\n     - Column 1 (from Row 1): L U W\n     - Column 2 (from Row 0): 3 F N\n     - Column 3 (from Row 0): F 7 K\n\n6. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     R P 8\n     L U W\n     3 F N\n     F 7 K\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified output format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - The rotated matrix in the specified format is:\n     <<<R,P,8,L,U,W,3,F,N,F,7,K>>>"
