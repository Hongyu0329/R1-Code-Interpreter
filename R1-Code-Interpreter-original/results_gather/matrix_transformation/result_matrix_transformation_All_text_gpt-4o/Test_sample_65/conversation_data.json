    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns):\n     ```\n     K P E 3\n     Y 2 P S\n     L J U 3\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns. Specifically, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the resulting matrix will have dimensions 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n   - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n   - The third column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n   - The fourth column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Construction**:\n   - Original first row: `K P E 3` becomes the last column: `3 S 3`\n   - Original second row: `Y 2 P S` becomes the second last column: `E P U`\n   - Original third row: `L J U 3` becomes the second column: `P 2 J`\n   - Original fourth row: `3 S 3` becomes the first column: `K Y L`\n\n6. **Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     L Y K\n     J 2 P\n     U P E\n     3 S 3\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<L,Y,K,J,2,P,U,P,E,3,S,3>>>"
