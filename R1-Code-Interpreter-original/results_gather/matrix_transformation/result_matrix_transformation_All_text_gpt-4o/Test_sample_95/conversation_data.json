    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     # @ ! &\n     ^ @ ! #\n     ^ # * &\n     $ * & %\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix. Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix will also be a 4x4 matrix since the original is square.\n   - We will construct the new matrix by taking elements from the original matrix in the following manner:\n     - The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n     - The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n     - The third column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n     - The fourth column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix.\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Let's construct the new matrix step by step:\n     - First column: Take the first row `# @ ! &` and reverse it to get `& ! @ #`.\n     - Second column: Take the second row `^ @ ! #` and reverse it to get `# ! @ ^`.\n     - Third column: Take the third row `^ # * &` and reverse it to get `& * # ^`.\n     - Fourth column: Take the fourth row `$ * & %` and reverse it to get `% & * $`.\n\n5. **Form the Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Combine the columns to form the rotated matrix:\n     ```\n     & ^ ^ $\n     ! @ # *\n     @ ! * &\n     # ^ & %\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the matrix into the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n   - The matrix in the required format is: <<<&,^,^,$,!,@,#,*,@,!,*,&,#,^,&,%>>>.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<&,^,^,$,!,@,#,*,@,!,*,&,#,^,&,%>>>"
