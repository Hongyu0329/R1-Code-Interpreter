    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to transform the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix. Let's perform this operation on the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n4 2 9\n9 4 7\n```\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\n9 4\n4 2\n7 9\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<9,4,4,2,7,9>>>."
