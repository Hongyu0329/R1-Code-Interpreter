    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to transform the rows into columns in reverse order. Let's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n2 1 3\n3 7 7\n```\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\n3 3\n7 1\n7 2\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<3,3,7,1,7,2>>>."
