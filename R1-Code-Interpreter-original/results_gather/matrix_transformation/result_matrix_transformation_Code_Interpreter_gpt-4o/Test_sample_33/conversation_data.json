    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 8 4\n7 4 1\n```\n\nFirst, we transpose the matrix:\n\n```\n1 7\n8 4\n4 1\n```\n\nNext, we reverse each row of the transposed matrix:\n\n```\n4 1\n8 4\n1 7\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<4,1,8,4,1,7>>>."
