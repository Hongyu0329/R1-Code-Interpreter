    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nR L\nK N\n```\n\n1. Transpose the matrix:\n   ```\n   R K\n   L N\n   ```\n\n2. Reverse each row:\n   ```\n   K R\n   N L\n   ```\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nK R\nN L\n```\n\nIn the specified format, the result is: <<<K,R,N,L>>>."
