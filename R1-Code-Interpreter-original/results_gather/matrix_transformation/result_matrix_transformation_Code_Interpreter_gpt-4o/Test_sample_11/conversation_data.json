    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nZ Z\nR R\n```\n\nAfter transposing:\n```\nZ R\nZ R\n```\n\nAfter reversing each row:\n```\nR Z\nR Z\n```\n\nSo, the rotated matrix is:\n```\nR Z\nR Z\n```\n\nIn the required format, the result is: <<<R,Z,R,Z>>>."
