    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nW U\nW F\n```\n\n1. Transpose the matrix:\n   ```\n   W W\n   U F\n   ```\n\n2. Reverse each row:\n   ```\n   W U\n   W F\n   ```\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nW W\nU F\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<W,W,U,F>>>."
