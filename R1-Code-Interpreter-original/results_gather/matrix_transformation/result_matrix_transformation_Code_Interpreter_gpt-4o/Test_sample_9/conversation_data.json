Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nS V\nU O\n```\n\n1. Transpose the matrix:\n   ```\n   S U\n   V O\n   ```\n\n2. Reverse each row:\n   ```\n   U S\n   O V\n   ```\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nU S\nO V\n```\n\nIn the specified format, the result is: <<<U,O,S,V>>>."
