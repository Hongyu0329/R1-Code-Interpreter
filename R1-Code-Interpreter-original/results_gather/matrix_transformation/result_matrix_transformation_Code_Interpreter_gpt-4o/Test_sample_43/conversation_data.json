    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\nZ D O\nK Q S\nR U P\n```\n\n### Step 1: Transpose the Matrix\n```\nZ K R\nD Q U\nO S P\n```\n\n### Step 2: Reverse Each Row\n```\nR K Z\nU Q D\nP S O\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<R,K,Z,U,Q,D,P,S,O>>>."
