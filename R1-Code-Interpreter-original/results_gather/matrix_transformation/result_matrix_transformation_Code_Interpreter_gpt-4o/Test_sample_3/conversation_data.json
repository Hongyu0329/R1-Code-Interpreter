    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nZ K\nY L\n```\n\nTranspose the matrix:\n```\nZ Y\nK L\n```\n\nReverse each row:\n```\nY Z\nL K\n```\n\nSo, the rotated matrix is:\n```\nY L\nZ K\n```\n\nIn the required format, the result is: <<<Y,L,Z,K>>>."
