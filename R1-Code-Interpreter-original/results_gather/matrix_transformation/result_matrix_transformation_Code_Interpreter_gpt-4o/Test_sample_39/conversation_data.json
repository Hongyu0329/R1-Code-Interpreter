    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n5 9 4\n8 2 1\n```\n\nFirst, transpose the matrix:\n\n```\n5 8\n9 2\n4 1\n```\n\nThen, reverse each row:\n\n```\n4 1\n9 2\n5 8\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<4,1,9,2,5,8>>>."
