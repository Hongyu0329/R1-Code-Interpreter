    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nJ T\nU B\n```\n\nTranspose the matrix:\n```\nJ U\nT B\n```\n\nReverse each row:\n```\nU J\nB T\n```\n\nSo, the rotated matrix is:\n```\nU J\nB T\n```\n\nIn the specified format, the result is: <<<U,J,B,T>>>."
