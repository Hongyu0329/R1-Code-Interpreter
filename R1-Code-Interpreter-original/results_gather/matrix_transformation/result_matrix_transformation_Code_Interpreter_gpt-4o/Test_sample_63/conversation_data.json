    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n3  X  S  N\n3  D  L  O\nB  6  C  3\n```\n\n### Step 1: Transpose the matrix\n```\n3  3  B\nX  D  6\nS  L  C\nN  O  3\n```\n\n### Step 2: Reverse each row\n```\nB  3  3\n6  D  X\nC  L  S\n3  O  N\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<B,3,3,6,D,X,C,L,S,3,O,N>>>."
