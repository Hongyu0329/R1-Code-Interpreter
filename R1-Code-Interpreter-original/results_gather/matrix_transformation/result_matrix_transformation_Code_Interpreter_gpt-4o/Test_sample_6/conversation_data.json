    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nF J\nU T\n```\n\n1. Transpose the matrix:\n   ```\n   F U\n   J T\n   ```\n\n2. Reverse each row:\n   ```\n   U F\n   T J\n   ```\n\nSo, the rotated matrix is:\n```\nU F\nT J\n```\n\nIn the required format, the result is: <<<U,F,T,J>>>."
