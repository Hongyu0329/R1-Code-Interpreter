    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n```\n7 1 1\n5 3 8\n```\n\nFirst, let's transpose the matrix:\n\n```\n7 5\n1 3\n1 8\n```\n\nNext, reverse each row of the transposed matrix:\n\n```\n5 7\n3 1\n8 1\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<5,7,3,1,8,1>>>."
