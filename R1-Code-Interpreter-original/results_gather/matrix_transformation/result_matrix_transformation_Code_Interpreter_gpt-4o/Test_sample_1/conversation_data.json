    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nV C\nY E\n```\n\nTranspose the matrix:\n```\nV Y\nC E\n```\n\nReverse each row:\n```\nY V\nE C\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<Y,E,V,C>>>."
