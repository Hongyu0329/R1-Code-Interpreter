    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to transform the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix. Let's perform this operation on the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n6 7 5\n9 2 4\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n9 6\n2 7\n4 5\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<9,6,2,7,4,5>>>."
