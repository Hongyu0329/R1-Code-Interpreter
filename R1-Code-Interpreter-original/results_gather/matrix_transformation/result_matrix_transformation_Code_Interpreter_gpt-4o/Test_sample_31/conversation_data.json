    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to transform the rows into columns in reverse order. Let's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n7 4 6\n6 9 4\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n```\n6 7\n9 4\n4 6\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<6,7,9,4,4,6>>>."
