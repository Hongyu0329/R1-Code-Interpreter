    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\nR G J\nZ U L\nK S V\n```\n\n### Step 1: Transpose the Matrix\n```\nR Z K\nG U S\nJ L V\n```\n\n### Step 2: Reverse Each Row\n```\nK Z R\nS U G\nV L J\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<K,Z,R,S,U,G,V,L,J>>>."
