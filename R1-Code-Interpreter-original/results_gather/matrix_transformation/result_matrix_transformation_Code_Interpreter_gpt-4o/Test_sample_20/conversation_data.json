    "\nassistant > To rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n```\n7 4 8\n7 5 4\n```\n\nFirst, let's transpose the matrix:\n\n```\n7 7\n4 5\n8 4\n```\n\nNext, reverse each row of the transposed matrix:\n\n```\n8 4\n4 5\n7 7\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested: <<<8,4,4,5,7,7>>>."
