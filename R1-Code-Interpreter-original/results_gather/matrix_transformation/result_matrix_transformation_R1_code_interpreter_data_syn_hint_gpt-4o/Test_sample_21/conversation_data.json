    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [2, 1, 3],\n  [3, 7, 7]\n]\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix, and so on.\n\nFor a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's apply this logic to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n[\n  [2, 1, 3],\n  [3, 7, 7]\n]\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n- The first row `[2, 1, 3]` becomes the last column `[3, 7]`.\n- The second row `[3, 7, 7]` becomes the second-to-last column `[1, 7]`.\n- The third row `[3, 7, 7]` becomes the first column `[2, 3]`.\n\nLet's implement this in code to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\n    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions n x m\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][m - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 1, 3],\n    [3, 7, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output matrix is:\n\n```\n[\n  [3, 2],\n  [7, 1],\n  [7, 3]\n]\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the original matrix. The first row of the original matrix `[2, 1, 3]` becomes the last column `[3, 7]`, and the second row `[3, 7, 7]` becomes the second-to-last column `[1, 7]`.\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested:\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n- First column: 3, 2\n- Second column: 7, 1\n- Third column: 7, 3\n\nTherefore, the formatted output is:\n\n<<<3,2,7,1,7,3>>>"
