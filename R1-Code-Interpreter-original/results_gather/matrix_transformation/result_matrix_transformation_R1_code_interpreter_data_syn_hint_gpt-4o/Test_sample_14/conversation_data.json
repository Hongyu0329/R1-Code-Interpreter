    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nR L\nK N\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n\n1. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n2. The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix.\n\nFor the given matrix:\n- The first row `['R', 'L']` will become the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row `['K', 'N']` will become the first column of the rotated matrix.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nK R\nN L\n```\n\nTo implement this transformation programmatically, we can use Python to manipulate the matrix. Let's write a Python script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the rotated matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [['R', 'L'], ['K', 'N']]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix in the required format\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result. Let's execute this code to see the output.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix:\n\n```\nR L\nK N\n```\n\nis successfully transformed into:\n\n```\nK R\nN L\n```\n\nThis transformation is achieved by transposing the matrix and then reversing each row of the transposed matrix. The code provided efficiently handles this operation for the given 2x2 matrix.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<K,R,N,L>>>"
