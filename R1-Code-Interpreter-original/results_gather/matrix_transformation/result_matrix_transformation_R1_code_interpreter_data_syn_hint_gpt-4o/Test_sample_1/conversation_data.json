    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nV C\nY E\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: This means converting rows into columns. The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nV C\nY E\n```\n\nTranspose the matrix:\n```\nV Y\nC E\n```\n\nReverse each row of the transposed matrix:\n```\nY V\nE C\n```\n\nThus, the matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation is:\n```\nY V\nE C\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as a list of values and symbols:\n\n<<<Y,E,V,C>>>"
