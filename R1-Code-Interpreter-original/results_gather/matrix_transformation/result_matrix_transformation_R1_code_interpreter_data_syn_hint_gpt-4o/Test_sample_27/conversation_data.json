    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n1 4 3\n6 8 7\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  [1, 4, 3],\n  [6, 8, 7]\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\n1. The element `1` at position `(0, 0)` moves to `(0, 1)`.\n2. The element `4` at position `(0, 1)` moves to `(1, 1)`.\n3. The element `3` at position `(0, 2)` moves to `(2, 1)`.\n4. The element `6` at position `(1, 0)` moves to `(0, 0)`.\n5. The element `8` at position `(1, 1)` moves to `(1, 0)`.\n6. The element `7` at position `(1, 2)` moves to `(2, 0)`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation and print the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 4, 3],\n    [6, 8, 7]\n]\n\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\nprint(rotated)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output matrix is:\n\n```\n[\n  [6, 1],\n  [8, 4],\n  [7, 3]\n]\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the original matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n1 4 3\n6 8 7\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n```\n6 1\n8 4\n7 3\n```\n\nThe transformation was correctly applied, and the output is as expected. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6,1,8,4,7,3>>>"
