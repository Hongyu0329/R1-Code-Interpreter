    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nZ P E\nZ T V\nG I V\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nHere's the step-by-step transformation:\n\n1. The first row `['Z', 'P', 'E']` becomes the last column:\n   - `E` goes to the first row, third column.\n   - `P` goes to the second row, third column.\n   - `Z` goes to the third row, third column.\n\n2. The second row `['Z', 'T', 'V']` becomes the second column:\n   - `V` goes to the first row, second column.\n   - `T` goes to the second row, second column.\n   - `Z` goes to the third row, second column.\n\n3. The third row `['G', 'I', 'V']` becomes the first column:\n   - `V` goes to the first row, first column.\n   - `I` goes to the second row, first column.\n   - `G` goes to the third row, first column.\n\nThe resulting matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation is:\n```\nG Z Z\nI T P\nV V E\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this transformation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the 90 degree rotated matrix\n    rotated = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed]\n    return rotated\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'P', 'E'],\n    ['Z', 'T', 'V'],\n    ['G', 'I', 'V']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_output = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result in the specified format.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for the 90-degree clockwise rotation of the given matrix. The matrix was successfully transformed from:\n\n```\nZ P E\nZ T V\nG I V\n```\n\nto:\n\n```\nG Z Z\nI T P\nV V E\n```\n\nThe output format `G,Z,Z,I,T,P,V,V,E` is consistent with the requirement to return the result as a list of values and symbols.\n\nSince the code has produced the correct result, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<G,Z,Z,I,T,P,V,V,E>>>"
