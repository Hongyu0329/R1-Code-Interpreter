    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nW T\nZ B\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, and the second row becomes the first column. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. The first column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the new matrix.\n2. The second column of the original matrix becomes the second row of the new matrix.\n\nSo, the transformation is as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) in the original matrix (W) moves to position (0,1) in the new matrix.\n- The element at position (0,1) in the original matrix (T) moves to position (0,0) in the new matrix.\n- The element at position (1,0) in the original matrix (Z) moves to position (1,1) in the new matrix.\n- The element at position (1,1) in the original matrix (B) moves to position (1,0) in the new matrix.\n\nThe resulting matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation will be:\n```\nZ W\nB T\n```\n\nNow, let's represent this transformation in code to verify our reasoning:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"W\", \"T\"],\n    [\"Z\", \"B\"]\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to match the required output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result matches our expectations, confirming that the matrix has been rotated correctly. The output `['Z', 'W', 'B', 'T']` represents the rotated matrix:\n\n```\nZ W\nB T\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the original matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Z,W,B,T>>>"
