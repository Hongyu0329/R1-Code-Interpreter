    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nD P M\nQ J F\nZ U V\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix, the second row of the new matrix will be the second-to-last column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. The first row of the rotated matrix will be the last column of the original matrix: `Z, Q, D`.\n2. The second row of the rotated matrix will be the second-to-last column of the original matrix: `U, J, P`.\n3. The third row of the rotated matrix will be the first column of the original matrix: `V, F, M`.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this transformation and verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['D', 'P', 'M'],\n    ['Q', 'J', 'F'],\n    ['Z', 'U', 'V']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected transformation of the matrix when rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output `Z,Q,D,U,J,P,V,F,M` represents the rotated matrix:\n\n```\nZ Q D\nU J P\nV F M\n```\n\nThis confirms that the transformation was performed correctly. The code used the `zip` function to transpose and reverse the rows of the matrix, which is an efficient way to achieve the desired rotation.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Z,Q,D,U,J,P,V,F,M>>>"
