    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nC T K\nY H F\nO N O\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row and first column (0,0) moves to the first row and last column (0,2).\n- The element at the first row and second column (0,1) moves to the second row and last column (1,2).\n- The element at the first row and third column (0,2) moves to the third row and last column (2,2).\n- Similarly, this pattern continues for all elements.\n\nThe general rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['C', 'T', 'K'],\n    ['Y', 'H', 'F'],\n    ['O', 'N', 'O']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Apply the rotation transformation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the output is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. The transformation was applied correctly, and the result matches the expected output for a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nC T K\nY H F\nO N O\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nO Y C\nN H T\nO F K\n```\n\nThis is represented as a flattened list: `['O', 'Y', 'C', 'N', 'H', 'T', 'O', 'F', 'K']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<O,Y,C,N,H,T,O,F,K>>>"
