    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n* # $ *\n% @ # @\n& * ^ %\n^ ! $ *\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row of the original matrix and making it the first column of the new matrix.\n2. Taking the second last row of the original matrix and making it the second column of the new matrix.\n3. Continuing this process for all rows.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n- The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nTo implement this, we can use Python to efficiently transform the matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['*', '#', '$', '*'],\n    ['%', '@', '#', '@'],\n    ['&', '*', '^', '%'],\n    ['^', '!', '$', '*']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output format\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the output format needs to be adjusted to match the required format. The task requires the output to be in the format of a list of values and symbols, separated by commas, and enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nLet's adjust the output format accordingly:\n\n1. The rotated matrix is already computed correctly.\n2. We need to format the output as a single string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nHere's the revised code to achieve the correct output format:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['*', '#', '$', '*'],\n    ['%', '@', '#', '@'],\n    ['&', '*', '^', '%'],\n    ['^', '!', '$', '*']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output format\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Format the result as a string in the required format\nformatted_output = f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_rotated_matrix)}>>>\"\n\n# Print the formatted result\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the correctly formatted result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix was rotated correctly and formatted as required. The output matches the expected format of a list of values and symbols, separated by commas, and enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Reversing the rows of the original matrix.\n2. Transposing the matrix to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n3. Flattening the rotated matrix into a single list.\n4. Formatting the list into a string with the specified format.\n\nSince the output is correct and matches the required format, we can conclude that the task has been successfully completed.\n\n<<<^,&,%,*,!,*,@,#,$,^,#,$,*,%,@,*>>>"
