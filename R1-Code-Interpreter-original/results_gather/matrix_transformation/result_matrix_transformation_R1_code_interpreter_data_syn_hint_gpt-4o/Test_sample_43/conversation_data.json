    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nZ D O\nK Q S\nR U P\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row, first column (0,0) will move to the first row, last column (0,2).\n- The element at the first row, second column (0,1) will move to the second row, last column (1,2).\n- The element at the first row, third column (0,2) will move to the third row, last column (2,2).\n- This pattern continues for all elements.\n\nThe general rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'D', 'O'],\n    ['K', 'Q', 'S'],\n    ['R', 'U', 'P']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Apply the rotation transformation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list for the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. The matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result was formatted as specified. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nZ D O\nK Q S\nR U P\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nR K Z\nU Q D\nP S O\n```\n\nThis matches the output from the code execution: `<<<R,K,Z,U,Q,D,P,S,O>>>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<R,K,Z,U,Q,D,P,S,O>>>"
