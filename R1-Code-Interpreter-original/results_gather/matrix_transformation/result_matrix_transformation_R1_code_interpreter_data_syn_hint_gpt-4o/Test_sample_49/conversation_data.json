    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nQ P K\nB Z I\nP H Y\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. The first row `Q P K` will become the last column:\n   - Q will be at the top of the last column.\n   - P will be in the middle of the last column.\n   - K will be at the bottom of the last column.\n\n2. The second row `B Z I` will become the second column:\n   - B will be at the top of the second column.\n   - Z will be in the middle of the second column.\n   - I will be at the bottom of the second column.\n\n3. The third row `P H Y` will become the first column:\n   - P will be at the top of the first column.\n   - H will be in the middle of the first column.\n   - Y will be at the bottom of the first column.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nP B Q\nH Z P\nY I K\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this rotation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the rotated matrix\n    rotated = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed]\n    return rotated\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'P', 'K'],\n    ['B', 'Z', 'I'],\n    ['P', 'H', 'Y']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_output = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_output}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for the 90-degree clockwise rotation of the given matrix. The matrix was successfully rotated, and the output was formatted as requested.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nQ P K\nB Z I\nP H Y\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nP B Q\nH Z P\nY I K\n```\n\nThis result is correctly represented in the output format as `<<<P,B,Q,H,Z,P,Y,I,K>>>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<P,B,Q,H,Z,P,Y,I,K>>>"
