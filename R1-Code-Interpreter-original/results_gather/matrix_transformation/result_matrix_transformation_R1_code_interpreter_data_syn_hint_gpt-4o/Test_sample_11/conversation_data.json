    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nZ Z\nR R\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['Z', 'Z'],\n  ['R', 'R']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nFor a 2x2 matrix, the transformation is as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to position (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to position (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to position (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to position (1,0).\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'Z'],\n    ['R', 'R']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, resulting in the list `['R', 'Z', 'R', 'Z']`. This matches the expected transformation of the original matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nZ Z\nR R\n```\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\nR Z\nR Z\n```\n\nThe flattened result of this rotated matrix is indeed `['R', 'Z', 'R', 'Z']`.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<R,Z,R,Z>>>"
