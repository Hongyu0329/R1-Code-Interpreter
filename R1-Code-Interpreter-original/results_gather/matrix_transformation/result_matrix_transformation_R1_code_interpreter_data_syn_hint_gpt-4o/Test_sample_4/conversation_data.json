    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nZ T\nO H\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as a 2D list:\n```\n[\n    ['Z', 'T'],\n    ['O', 'H']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nThe transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The first column `['Z', 'O']` becomes the first row `['O', 'Z']`.\n- The second column `['T', 'H']` becomes the second row `['H', 'T']`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['O', 'Z'],\n    ['H', 'T']\n]\n```\n\nTo implement this transformation programmatically, we can use Python to manipulate the 2D list. Let's write a Python script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n    return [list(reversed(col)) for col in zip(*matrix)]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'T'],\n    ['O', 'H']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result. Let's execute the code to verify the output.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it successfully rotated the given 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise. The output matches the expected transformation of the matrix.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nZ T\nO H\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nO Z\nH T\n```\n\nThis transformation is accurately represented by the output:\n```\n[['O', 'Z'], ['H', 'T']]\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<O,Z,H,T>>>"
