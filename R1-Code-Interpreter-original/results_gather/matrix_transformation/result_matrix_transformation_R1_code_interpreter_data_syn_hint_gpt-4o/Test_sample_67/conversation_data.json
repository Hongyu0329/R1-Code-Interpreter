    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [6, P, T, D],\n    [7, L, L, 4],\n    [P, C, O, S]\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['6', 'P', 'T', 'D'],\n    ['7', 'L', 'L', '4'],\n    ['P', 'C', 'O', 'S']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened form, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the output format needs to be adjusted to match the required format. The task requires the output to be in the format of a list of values and symbols, separated by commas, and enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nLet's format the output correctly:\n\n1. The rotated matrix is:\n   ```\n   [\n       ['P', '7', '6'],\n       ['C', 'L', 'P'],\n       ['O', 'L', 'T'],\n       ['S', '4', 'D']\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. We need to flatten this matrix into a single list and format it as a string with the required format.\n\nLet's proceed with the final answer:\n\n<<<P,7,6,C,L,P,O,L,T,S,4,D>>>"
