    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [B, S, N],\n  [S, O, B],\n  [I, P, I]\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['B', 'S', 'N'],\n    ['S', 'O', 'B'],\n    ['I', 'P', 'I']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty strings\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows the rotated matrix as a flattened list: `['I', 'S', 'B', 'P', 'O', 'S', 'I', 'B', 'N']`. This result is consistent with the expected transformation of the matrix when rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nTo verify, let's visualize the transformation:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nB S N\nS O B\nI P I\n```\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\nI S B\nP O S\nI B N\n```\n\nFlattened result: `['I', 'S', 'B', 'P', 'O', 'S', 'I', 'B', 'N']`\n\nThe code correctly implements the transformation and outputs the expected result. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<I,S,B,P,O,S,I,B,N>>>"
