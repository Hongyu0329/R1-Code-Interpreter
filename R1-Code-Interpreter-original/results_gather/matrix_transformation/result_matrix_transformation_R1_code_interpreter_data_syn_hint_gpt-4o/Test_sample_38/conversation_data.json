    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n4 1 3\n4 7 1\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row, first column (top-left) moves to the first row, last column (top-right).\n- The element at the first row, second column moves to the second row, last column.\n- The element at the first row, third column moves to the third row, last column.\n- The element at the second row, first column moves to the first row, second column.\n- The element at the second row, second column moves to the second row, second column.\n- The element at the second row, third column moves to the third row, second column.\n\nIn general, for a matrix element at position (i, j), after a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it will move to position (j, n-1-i), where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows in the original matrix\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Number of columns in the original matrix\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions m x n\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix with the appropriate elements\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['4', '1', '3'],\n    ['4', '7', '1']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as requested\noutput = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated])\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and format the output as requested.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the output is formatted correctly. The original matrix:\n\n```\n4 1 3\n4 7 1\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n\n```\n4 4\n7 1\n1 3\n```\n\nThis matches the output: `<<<4,4,7,1,1,3>>>`.\n\nThe code correctly implements the logic for rotating the matrix and formats the output as requested. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4,4,7,1,1,3>>>"
