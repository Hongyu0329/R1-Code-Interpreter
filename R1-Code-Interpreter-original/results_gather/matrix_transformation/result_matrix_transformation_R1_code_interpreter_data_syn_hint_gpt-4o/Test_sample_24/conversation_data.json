    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n7 1 2\n7 8 9\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row, first column (top-left corner) moves to the first row, last column (top-right corner).\n- The element at the first row, second column moves to the second row, last column.\n- The element at the first row, third column moves to the third row, last column.\n- The element at the second row, first column moves to the first row, second column.\n- The element at the second row, second column moves to the second row, second column.\n- The element at the second row, third column moves to the third row, second column.\n\nThis can be generalized as:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"7\", \"1\", \"2\"],\n    [\"7\", \"8\", \"9\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty strings\nrotated_matrix = [[\"\" for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of strings\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result seems to be correct, as it matches the expected output for a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the given matrix. Let's verify the transformation step-by-step:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n7 1 2\n7 8 9\n```\n\nAfter a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the matrix should look like:\n```\n7 7\n8 1\n9 2\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix row-wise gives us the sequence: `7, 7, 8, 1, 9, 2`.\n\nThe code correctly implements the transformation logic and outputs the result in the required format. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7,7,8,1,9,2>>>"
