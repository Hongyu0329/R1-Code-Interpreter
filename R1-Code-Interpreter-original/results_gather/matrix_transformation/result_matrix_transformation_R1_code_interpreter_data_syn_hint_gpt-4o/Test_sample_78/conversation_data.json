    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nL 1 9 M\nT J 9 G\nZ X U U\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n    ['L', '1', '9', 'M'],\n    ['T', 'J', '9', 'G'],\n    ['Z', 'X', 'U', 'U']\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', '1', '9', 'M'],\n    ['T', 'J', '9', 'G'],\n    ['Z', 'X', 'U', 'U']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Rotated matrix initialization\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated correctly, and the output matches the expected transformation of the matrix when rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The process involved iterating over the original matrix and placing each element in its new position in the rotated matrix.\n\nTo ensure clarity, let's break down the transformation:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nL 1 9 M\nT J 9 G\nZ X U U\n```\n\nRotated matrix (90 degrees clockwise):\n```\nZ T L\nX J 1\nU 9 9\nU G M\n```\n\nFlattened result:\n```\nZ, T, L, X, J, 1, U, 9, 9, U, G, M\n```\n\nThe code correctly implemented the transformation by iterating over each element and placing it in the new position according to the rule `(j, n-1-i)`. The final output was formatted as requested.\n\nSince the code execution was successful and the output is correct, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<Z,T,L,X,J,1,U,9,9,U,G,M>>>"
