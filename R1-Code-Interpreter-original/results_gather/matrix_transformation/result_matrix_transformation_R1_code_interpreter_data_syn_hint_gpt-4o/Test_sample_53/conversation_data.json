    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during the rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nN A V\nF S D\nR U X\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and the third row becomes the first column. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. The first row `N A V` will become the last column:\n   - N will be at the top of the last column.\n   - A will be in the middle of the last column.\n   - V will be at the bottom of the last column.\n\n2. The second row `F S D` will become the second column:\n   - F will be at the top of the second column.\n   - S will be in the middle of the second column.\n   - D will be at the bottom of the second column.\n\n3. The third row `R U X` will become the first column:\n   - R will be at the top of the first column.\n   - U will be in the middle of the first column.\n   - X will be at the bottom of the first column.\n\nThe resulting matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation will be:\n```\nR F N\nU S A\nX D V\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'A', 'V'],\n    ['F', 'S', 'D'],\n    ['R', 'U', 'X']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for the 90-degree clockwise rotation of the given matrix. The matrix transformation was implemented correctly, and the output format is as specified.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nR F N\nU S A\nX D V\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the output: `R,F,N,U,S,A,X,D,V`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<R,F,N,U,S,A,X,D,V>>>"
