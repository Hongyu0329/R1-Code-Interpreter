    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nM X\nB U\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as a 2D list:\n```\n[\n  ['M', 'X'],\n  ['B', 'U']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) in the original matrix moves to position (0,1) in the rotated matrix.\n- The element at position (0,1) in the original matrix moves to position (1,1) in the rotated matrix.\n- The element at position (1,0) in the original matrix moves to position (0,0) in the rotated matrix.\n- The element at position (1,1) in the original matrix moves to position (1,0) in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'X'],\n    ['B', 'U']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = [\n    [matrix[1][0], matrix[0][0]],\n    [matrix[1][1], matrix[0][1]]\n]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values and symbols\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the output format needs to be adjusted to match the required format of a list of values and symbols. The current output is a list of strings, but it should be formatted as a string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nLet's adjust the output format to meet the requirements.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'X'],\n    ['B', 'U']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = [\n    [matrix[1][0], matrix[0][0]],\n    [matrix[1][1], matrix[0][1]]\n]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values and symbols\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Format the result as a string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in angle brackets\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\"\n\n# Print the formatted result\nprint(formatted_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the correctly formatted output.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the output is formatted as required. The matrix has been successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result is presented in the specified format.\n\nTo ensure clarity, let's summarize the process:\n\n1. The original matrix is:\n   ```\n   M X\n   B U\n   ```\n\n2. When rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   B M\n   U X\n   ```\n\n3. The flattened and formatted result is: `<<<B,M,U,X>>>`\n\nSince the task is straightforward and the code has produced the correct output, there is no need for more complex symbolic computing or optimization in this context. The task has been completed successfully.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
