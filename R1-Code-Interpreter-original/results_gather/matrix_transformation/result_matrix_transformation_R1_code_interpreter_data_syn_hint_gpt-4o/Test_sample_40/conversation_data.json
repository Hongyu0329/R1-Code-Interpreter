    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nS Z M\nS D F\nV W X\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix, the second row of the new matrix will be the second-to-last column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. The last column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the new matrix: `V S S`\n2. The second-to-last column of the original matrix becomes the second row of the new matrix: `W D Z`\n3. The first column of the original matrix becomes the last row of the new matrix: `X F M`\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"S\", \"Z\", \"M\"],\n    [\"S\", \"D\", \"F\"],\n    [\"V\", \"W\", \"X\"]\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and format the output as required. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The output `V,S,S,W,D,Z,X,F,M` represents the rotated matrix in a flattened format.\n\nTo ensure clarity, let's break down the result:\n- The first row of the rotated matrix is `V, S, S`\n- The second row of the rotated matrix is `W, D, Z`\n- The third row of the rotated matrix is `X, F, M`\n\nThis matches the expected transformation when rotating the original matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<V,S,S,W,D,Z,X,F,M>>>"
