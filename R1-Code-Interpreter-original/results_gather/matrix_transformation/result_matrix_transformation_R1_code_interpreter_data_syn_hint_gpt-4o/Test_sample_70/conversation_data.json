    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [O, U, Y, 1],\n    [T, 9, Q, W],\n    [Y, 8, Z, D]\n]\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nFor a matrix of size `m x n`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['O', 'U', 'Y', '1'],\n    ['T', '9', 'Q', 'W'],\n    ['Y', '8', 'Z', 'D']\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nm = len(matrix)\nn = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions n x m\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][m-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened form, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result provides the rotated matrix in a flattened form. To present the result in the required format, we need to convert this list into a string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nThe output from the code execution is:\n```\n['Y', 'T', 'O', '8', '9', 'U', 'Z', 'Q', 'Y', 'D', 'W', '1']\n```\n\nThis represents the rotated matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['Y', 'T', 'O'],\n    ['8', '9', 'U'],\n    ['Z', 'Q', 'Y'],\n    ['D', 'W', '1']\n]\n```\n\nTo format this as requested, we need to convert it into a single string with elements separated by commas.\n\nLet's format the output correctly:\n\n```python\n# Code output from the previous execution\nrotated_matrix_flat = ['Y', 'T', 'O', '8', '9', 'U', 'Z', 'Q', 'Y', 'D', 'W', '1']\n\n# Convert the list to the required string format\nformatted_output = f\"<<<{','.join(rotated_matrix_flat)}>>>\"\n\n# Print the formatted output\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis will provide the final answer in the required format.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it provides the rotated matrix in the required format. The task was to rotate the given 2D array 90 degrees clockwise and return the result in a specific format. The output `<<<Y,T,O,8,9,U,Z,Q,Y,D,W,1>>>` correctly represents the rotated matrix.\n\nTo summarize the process:\n1. We took the original matrix and applied the transformation to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.\n2. We flattened the rotated matrix into a single list.\n3. We formatted the list into a string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is ready and correctly formatted. \n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
