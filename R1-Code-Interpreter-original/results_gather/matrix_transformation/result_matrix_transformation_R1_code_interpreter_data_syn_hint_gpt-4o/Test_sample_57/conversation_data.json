    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nL A D\nR P Z\nH D Y\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row, first column (0,0) will move to the first row, last column (0,2).\n- The element at the first row, second column (0,1) will move to the second row, last column (1,2).\n- The element at the first row, third column (0,2) will move to the third row, last column (2,2).\n- Similarly, this pattern continues for all elements.\n\nThe general rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\nL A D\nR P Z\nH D Y\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n- First column becomes the first row: H, R, L\n- Second column becomes the second row: D, P, A\n- Third column becomes the third row: Y, Z, D\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\nH R L\nD P A\nY Z D\n```\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested:\n\n<<<H,R,L,D,P,A,Y,Z,D>>>"
