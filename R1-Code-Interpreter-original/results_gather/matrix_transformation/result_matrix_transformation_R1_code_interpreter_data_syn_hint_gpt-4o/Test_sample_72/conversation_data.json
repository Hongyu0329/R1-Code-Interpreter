    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nR 7 I S\nS K C A\n1 1 S E\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row of the original matrix and making it the first column of the new matrix.\n2. Taking the second last row of the original matrix and making it the second column of the new matrix.\n3. Continuing this process for all rows.\n\nThe transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n- The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n- The third column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['R', '7', 'I', 'S'],\n    ['S', 'K', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['1', '1', 'S', 'E']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the output is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. However, the task requires the output to be in a specific format, which is a list of values and symbols representing the 2D array after rotation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem and ensure that the output format matches the requirement. The rotated matrix should be represented as a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the rotated matrix.\n\nGiven the original matrix:\n```\nR 7 I S\nS K C A\n1 1 S E\n```\n\nThe rotated matrix should be:\n```\n1 S R\n1 K 7\nS C I\nE A S\n```\n\nLet's adjust the code to output the result in the correct format.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['R', '7', 'I', 'S'],\n    ['S', 'K', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['1', '1', 'S', 'E']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Format the rotated matrix as a list of strings\nformatted_result = [','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(formatted_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in the required format. Let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the output is a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the rotated matrix. However, the task requires the output to be in a specific format, which is a list of values and symbols representing the 2D array after rotation.\n\nThe output format should be a single string with all elements separated by commas, representing the entire rotated matrix. Let's adjust the code to output the result in the correct format.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['R', '7', 'I', 'S'],\n    ['S', 'K', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['1', '1', 'S', 'E']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix and format as a single string\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\nformatted_result = ','.join(flattened_result)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(formatted_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in the required format as a single string. Let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct in terms of the transformation of the matrix, but the output format needs to be adjusted to match the required format. The task specifies that the output should be in the format of a list of values and symbols, which means it should be enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nGiven the rotated matrix:\n```\n1 S R\n1 K 7\nS C I\nE A S\n```\n\nThe correct output format should be:\n```\n<<<1,S,R,1,K,7,S,C,I,E,A,S>>>\n```\n\nLet's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<1,S,R,1,K,7,S,C,I,E,A,S>>>"
