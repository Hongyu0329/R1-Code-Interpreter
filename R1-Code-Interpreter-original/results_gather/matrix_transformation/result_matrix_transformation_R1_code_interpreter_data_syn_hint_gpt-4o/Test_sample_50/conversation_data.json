    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nM G K\nN H H\nE I Z\n```\n\nThis is a 3x3 matrix. When we rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and the third row becomes the first column. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'G', 'K'],\n    ['N', 'H', 'H'],\n    ['E', 'I', 'Z']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list for the output\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows the correct output for the rotated matrix, but it seems there was an error in the format of the final answer. The task requires the output to be in a specific format, which is a list of values and symbols separated by commas and enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's format the output correctly based on the result from the code execution.\n\nThe rotated matrix, when flattened, is:\n```\n['E', 'N', 'M', 'I', 'H', 'G', 'Z', 'H', 'K']\n```\n\nTo match the required format, we need to convert this list into a string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n<<<'E,N,M,I,H,G,Z,H,K'>>>"
