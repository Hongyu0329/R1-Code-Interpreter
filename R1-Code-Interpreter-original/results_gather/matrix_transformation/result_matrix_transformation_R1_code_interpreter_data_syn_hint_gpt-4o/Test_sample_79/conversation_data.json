    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [X, 5, X, H],\n    [1, 9, W, K],\n    [4, Q, K, L]\n]\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix, and so on.\n\nFor a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['X', '5', 'X', 'H'],\n    ['1', '9', 'W', 'K'],\n    ['4', 'Q', 'K', 'L']\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nm = len(matrix)\nn = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions n x m\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][m-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result provides the rotated matrix as a flattened list. To ensure clarity and correctness, let's verify the transformation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Matrix:**\n   ```\n   [\n       ['X', '5', 'X', 'H'],\n       ['1', '9', 'W', 'K'],\n       ['4', 'Q', 'K', 'L']\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotated Matrix (90 degrees clockwise):**\n   - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n   - The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n   - The third row of the original matrix becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n\n   The transformation is as follows:\n   - `['X', '5', 'X', 'H']` becomes `['4', '1', 'X']`\n   - `['1', '9', 'W', 'K']` becomes `['Q', '9', '5']`\n   - `['4', 'Q', 'K', 'L']` becomes `['K', 'W', 'X']`\n   - The last column is `['L', 'K', 'H']`\n\n   Therefore, the rotated matrix is:\n   ```\n   [\n       ['4', '1', 'X'],\n       ['Q', '9', '5'],\n       ['K', 'W', 'X'],\n       ['L', 'K', 'H']\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Flattened Result:**\n   - The flattened result of the rotated matrix is `['4', '1', 'X', 'Q', '9', '5', 'K', 'W', 'X', 'L', 'K', 'H']`.\n\nThe code correctly computes the rotated matrix and outputs it as a flattened list. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['4', '1', 'X', 'Q', '9', '5', 'K', 'W', 'X', 'L', 'K', 'H']>>>"
