    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given matrix element at position (i, j), after a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it will move to the position (j, n-1-i), where n is the number of columns in the original matrix. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: This means converting rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nG 6 B H\nK Q 3 7\n7 2 H 4\n```\n\nWe will apply the above steps to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', '6', 'B', 'H'],\n    ['K', 'Q', '3', '7'],\n    ['7', '2', 'H', '4']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result provides the rotated matrix, which is the desired output. The matrix has been successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nG 6 B H\nK Q 3 7\n7 2 H 4\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n7 K G\n2 Q 6\nH 3 B\n4 7 H\n```\n\nThis matches the output from the code execution. Now, I will format the result as requested:\n\nThe rotated matrix is represented as <<<7,K,G,2,Q,6,H,3,B,4,7,H>>>.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
