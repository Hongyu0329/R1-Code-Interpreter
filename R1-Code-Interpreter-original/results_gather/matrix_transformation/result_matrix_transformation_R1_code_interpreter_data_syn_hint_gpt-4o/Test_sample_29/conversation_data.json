    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n4 2 7\n7 8 6\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n4 2 7\n7 8 6\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n- The first row `[4, 2, 7]` becomes the last column `[7, 2, 4]`.\n- The second row `[7, 8, 6]` becomes the first column `[6, 8, 7]`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\n7 4\n8 2\n6 7\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this rotation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Number of columns\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    # Perform the rotation\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 2, 7],\n    [7, 8, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n7 4\n8 2\n6 7\n```\n\nThis result is consistent with the transformation rules for a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The code correctly implemented the logic to achieve this transformation.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<7,4,8,2,6,7>>>"
