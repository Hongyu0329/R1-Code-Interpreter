    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nR N\nC P\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n\n1. The first column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the new matrix, but in reverse order.\n2. The second column of the original matrix becomes the second row of the new matrix, also in reverse order.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first column of the original matrix is `R, C`. When rotated, it becomes the first row of the new matrix: `C, R`.\n- The second column of the original matrix is `N, P`. When rotated, it becomes the second row of the new matrix: `P, N`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\nC R\nP N\n```\n\nNow, let's format this result as a list of values and symbols as requested.\n\nThe rotated matrix can be represented as:\n```\nC, R\nP, N\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<C,R,P,N>>>"
