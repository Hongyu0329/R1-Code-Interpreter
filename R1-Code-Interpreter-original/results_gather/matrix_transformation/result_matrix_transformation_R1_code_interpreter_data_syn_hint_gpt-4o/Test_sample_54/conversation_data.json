    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nW V Z\nP P X\nO J V\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The third row of the original matrix becomes the first column of the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n2. The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n3. The third column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n\nTo implement this, we can use Python to perform the transformation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['W', 'V', 'Z'],\n    ['P', 'P', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'J', 'V']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The process involves transposing the matrix and then reversing each row, which is effectively what the code does.\n\nTo clarify the transformation:\n- The first row of the original matrix `['W', 'V', 'Z']` becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix `['P', 'P', 'X']` becomes the second column of the rotated matrix.\n- The third row of the original matrix `['O', 'J', 'V']` becomes the first column of the rotated matrix.\n\nThe resulting rotated matrix is:\n```\nO P W\nJ P V\nV X Z\n```\n\nThis is represented in the output as a single string with commas separating the elements: `O,P,W,J,P,V,V,X,Z`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<O,P,W,J,P,V,V,X,Z>>>"
