    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nR G J\nZ U L\nK S V\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the first column from the bottom to the top and making it the first row.\n2. Taking the second column from the bottom to the top and making it the second row.\n3. Taking the third column from the bottom to the top and making it the third row.\n\nThis can be achieved by:\n- Reversing the order of rows.\n- Transposing the matrix (i.e., converting rows to columns).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['R', 'G', 'J'],\n    ['Z', 'U', 'L'],\n    ['K', 'S', 'V']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Convert tuples to lists and format the output\nrotated_matrix = [list(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\nformatted_output = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\n\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the rotated matrix in the desired format.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The process involved reversing the rows and then transposing the matrix, which is a standard approach for this type of problem.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nR G J\nZ U L\nK S V\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nK Z R\nS U G\nV L J\n```\n\nThis is represented as `K,Z,R,S,U,G,V,L,J` in the output format.\n\nSince the code execution result is correct and there are no errors, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<K,Z,R,S,U,G,V,L,J>>>"
