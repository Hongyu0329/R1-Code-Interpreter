    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nT S I X\n5 5 3 E\nI S 7 H\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the first column from the bottom to the top and making it the first row.\n2. Taking the second column from the bottom to the top and making it the second row.\n3. Continuing this process for all columns.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The first column (from bottom to top) is `I, 5, T`, which becomes the first row.\n- The second column (from bottom to top) is `S, 5, S`, which becomes the second row.\n- The third column (from bottom to top) is `7, 3, I`, which becomes the third row.\n- The fourth column (from bottom to top) is `H, E, X`, which becomes the fourth row.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\nI 5 T\nS 5 S\n7 3 I\nH E X\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure the transformation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"T\", \"S\", \"I\", \"X\"],\n    [\"5\", \"5\", \"3\", \"E\"],\n    [\"I\", \"S\", \"7\", \"H\"]\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = [\",\".join(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \",\".join(result) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for the rotated matrix. The process of rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise was implemented correctly using Python's `zip` function and list slicing.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nT S I X\n5 5 3 E\nI S 7 H\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nI 5 T\nS 5 S\n7 3 I\nH E X\n```\n\nThe output format is also correct, as it is presented in the form of a single string with elements separated by commas, enclosed within `<<<` and `>>>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<I,5,T,S,5,S,7,3,I,H,E,X>>>"
