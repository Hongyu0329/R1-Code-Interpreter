    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n5 2 6\n8 6 8\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['5', '2', '6'],\n    ['8', '6', '8']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated correctly, and the output format is as expected. The original matrix:\n\n```\n5 2 6\n8 6 8\n```\n\nwas rotated 90 degrees clockwise to become:\n\n```\n8 5\n6 2\n8 6\n```\n\nFlattening this rotated matrix results in the sequence: `8,5,6,2,8,6`.\n\nThe output format is correct, and there are no errors in the code execution. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8,5,6,2,8,6>>>"
