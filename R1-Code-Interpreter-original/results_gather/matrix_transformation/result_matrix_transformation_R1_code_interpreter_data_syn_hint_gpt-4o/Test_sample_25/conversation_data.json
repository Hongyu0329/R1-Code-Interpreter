    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [6, 7, 5],\n  [9, 2, 4]\n]\n```\n\nThe rotation of this matrix 90 degrees clockwise will result in:\n- The first row of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first column of the original matrix.\n- The second row of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second column of the original matrix.\n- The third row of the new matrix will be the reverse of the third column of the original matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. The original matrix has dimensions 2x3 (2 rows and 3 columns).\n2. The rotated matrix will have dimensions 3x2 (3 rows and 2 columns).\n3. The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 7, 5],\n    [9, 2, 4]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * rows for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the rotated matrix is as expected. The matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n[\n  [6, 7, 5],\n  [9, 2, 4]\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n[\n  [9, 6],\n  [2, 7],\n  [4, 5]\n]\n```\n\nThis matches the output from the code execution. Now, I will format the answer as requested.\n\n<<<9,6,2,7,4,5>>>"
