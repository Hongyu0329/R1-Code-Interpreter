    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n3 X S N\n3 D L O\nB 6 C 3\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row of the original matrix and making it the first column of the new matrix.\n2. Taking the second last row of the original matrix and making it the second column of the new matrix.\n3. Continuing this process until the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n- The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n- The third column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n- The fourth column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['3', 'X', 'S', 'N'],\n    ['3', 'D', 'L', 'O'],\n    ['B', '6', 'C', '3']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the output as a flattened list of the rotated matrix. However, the task requires the output to be formatted as a list of values and symbols, representing the 2D array after rotation.\n\nLet's format the output correctly. The rotated matrix should be represented as a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the rotated matrix.\n\nGiven the output from the code execution:\n```\n['B', '3', '3', '6', 'D', 'X', 'C', 'L', 'S', '3', 'O', 'N']\n```\n\nWe can format it as:\n- First row: 'B', '3', '3'\n- Second row: '6', 'D', 'X'\n- Third row: 'C', 'L', 'S'\n- Fourth row: '3', 'O', 'N'\n\nThus, the final formatted output should be:\n<<<B,3,3,6,D,X,C,L,S,3,O,N>>>"
