    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n8 4 8\n4 5 4\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D list:\n```\n[\n    ['8', '4', '8'],\n    ['4', '5', '4']\n]\n```\n\nTo rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['8', '4', '8'],\n    ['4', '5', '4']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to match the required output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the output is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. The result `['4', '8', '5', '4', '4', '8']` corresponds to the rotated matrix:\n\n```\n4 8\n5 4\n4 8\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the original matrix:\n\nOriginal:\n```\n8 4 8\n4 5 4\n```\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\n4 8\n5 4\n4 8\n```\n\nThe output is correct, and the code has achieved the desired transformation. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4,8,5,4,4,8>>>"
