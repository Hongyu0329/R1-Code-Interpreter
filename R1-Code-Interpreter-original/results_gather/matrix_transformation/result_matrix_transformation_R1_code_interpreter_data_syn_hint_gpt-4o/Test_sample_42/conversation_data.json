    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nS L D\nR I S\nK F L\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row, first column (0,0) moves to the first row, last column (0,2).\n- The element at the first row, second column (0,1) moves to the second row, last column (1,2).\n- The element at the first row, third column (0,2) moves to the third row, last column (2,2).\n- This pattern continues for all elements.\n\nThe general rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'L', 'D'],\n    ['R', 'I', 'S'],\n    ['K', 'F', 'L']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Apply the rotation transformation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is the flattened list of the rotated matrix. The task was to rotate the given 2D array 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a specific format. The output list represents the rotated matrix in a row-major order.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nS L D\nR I S\nK F L\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nK R S\nF I L\nL S D\n```\n\nThe flattened list of this rotated matrix is `['K', 'R', 'S', 'F', 'I', 'L', 'L', 'S', 'D']`.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<K,R,S,F,I,L,L,S,D>>>"
