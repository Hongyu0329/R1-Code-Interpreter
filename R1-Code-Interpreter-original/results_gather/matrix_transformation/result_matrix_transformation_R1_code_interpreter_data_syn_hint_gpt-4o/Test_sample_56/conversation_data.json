    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nG Y Z\nA A A\nU B Y\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'Y', 'Z'],\n    ['A', 'A', 'A'],\n    ['U', 'B', 'Y']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. The matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result was flattened into a single list. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nG Y Z\nA A A\nU B Y\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nU A G\nB A Y\nY A Z\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix row by row results in the list:\n```\n['U', 'A', 'G', 'B', 'A', 'Y', 'Y', 'A', 'Z']\n```\n\nThis matches the output from the code execution. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<U,A,G,B,A,Y,Y,A,Z>>>"
