    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nA J X X\n9 S 4 7\nR X V T\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the first column from the bottom to the top and making it the first row.\n2. Taking the second column from the bottom to the top and making it the second row.\n3. Continuing this process for all columns.\n\nFor the given matrix, the transformation would be:\n- The first column (R, 9, A) becomes the first row (R, 9, A).\n- The second column (X, S, J) becomes the second row (X, S, J).\n- The third column (V, 4, X) becomes the third row (V, 4, X).\n- The fourth column (T, 7, X) becomes the fourth row (T, 7, X).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(matrix)\n    num_cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = []\n    \n    # Rotate the matrix\n    for col in range(num_cols):\n        new_row = []\n        for row in range(num_rows - 1, -1, -1):\n            new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n        rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['A', 'J', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['9', 'S', '4', '7'],\n    ['R', 'X', 'V', 'T']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected transformation of the matrix when rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The process involves taking each column from the original matrix and reversing it to form a new row in the rotated matrix.\n\nThe output of the code is:\n```\n[['R', '9', 'A'], ['X', 'S', 'J'], ['V', '4', 'X'], ['T', '7', 'X']]\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the rotated matrix:\n```\nR 9 A\nX S J\nV 4 X\nT 7 X\n```\n\nNow, I will format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<R,9,A,X,S,J,V,4,X,T,7,X>>>"
