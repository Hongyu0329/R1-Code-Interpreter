    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n1 8 4\n7 4 1\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['1', '8', '4'],\n  ['7', '4', '1']\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\n1. The element '1' at position (0, 0) will move to (0, 1).\n2. The element '8' at position (0, 1) will move to (1, 1).\n3. The element '4' at position (0, 2) will move to (2, 1).\n4. The element '7' at position (1, 0) will move to (0, 0).\n5. The element '4' at position (1, 1) will move to (1, 0).\n6. The element '1' at position (1, 2) will move to (2, 0).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this rotation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['1', '8', '4'],\n    ['7', '4', '1']\n]\n\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated])\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output format is incorrect. The expected output should represent a 2D array, but the result is a single list of values. Let's correct this by ensuring that the output format matches the expected 2D array structure.\n\nThe correct transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation should result in a matrix where the rows become columns in reverse order. Let's re-evaluate the transformation and adjust the code accordingly.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n1 8 4\n7 4 1\n```\n\nThe expected rotated matrix should be:\n```\n7 1\n4 8\n1 4\n```\n\nLet's update the code to ensure it outputs the result in the correct format:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['1', '8', '4'],\n    ['7', '4', '1']\n]\n\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated])\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly output the rotated matrix in the expected 2D array format. Let's execute it to verify the result.",
    "The issue with the previous code is that it does not format the output correctly to represent a 2D array. The output should reflect the structure of the rotated matrix, with each row clearly delineated. Let's address this by ensuring that the output format is correct.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n1 8 4\n7 4 1\n```\n\nThe expected rotated matrix should be:\n```\n7 1\n4 8\n1 4\n```\n\nTo achieve this, we need to ensure that each row of the rotated matrix is clearly separated in the output. Let's modify the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['1', '8', '4'],\n    ['7', '4', '1']\n]\n\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\nresult = ','.join([''.join(row) for row in rotated])\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly output the rotated matrix in the expected 2D array format. Let's execute it to verify the result.",
    "The issue with the previous code is that it concatenates the elements of each row without any separator, which results in a single string for each row. To correctly represent the rotated matrix as a 2D array, we need to ensure that each element within a row is separated by a comma, and each row is clearly delineated.\n\nLet's adjust the code to ensure that the output format is correct, with each element separated by a comma and each row clearly represented:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['1', '8', '4'],\n    ['7', '4', '1']\n]\n\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated])\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly output the rotated matrix in the expected 2D array format, with each element separated by a comma. Let's execute it to verify the result.",
    "The previous attempts have not correctly formatted the output to represent a 2D array. Let's take a step back and ensure that the output format is correct. The goal is to output the rotated matrix in a way that clearly shows each row and column.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n1 8 4\n7 4 1\n```\n\nThe expected rotated matrix should be:\n```\n7 1\n4 8\n1 4\n```\n\nTo achieve this, we need to ensure that each row of the rotated matrix is clearly separated in the output.

    "The code execution result is now correctly formatted to represent a 2D array, with each row clearly delineated. The output `<<<(7,1),(4,8),(1,4)>>>` accurately reflects the rotated matrix:\n\n```\n7 1\n4 8\n1 4\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the original matrix when rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output format is consistent with the requirement to represent the matrix as a list of values and symbols.\n\nSince the output is now correct, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<(7,1),(4,8),(1,4)>>>"
