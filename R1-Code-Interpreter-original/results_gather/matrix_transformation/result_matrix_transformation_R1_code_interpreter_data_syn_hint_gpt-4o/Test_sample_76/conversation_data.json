    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n8 W N K\nP U F 7\nR L 3 F\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row and making it the first column.\n2. Taking the second last row and making it the second column.\n3. Continuing this process until the first row becomes the last column.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n- The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n- The third column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['8', 'W', 'N', 'K'],\n    ['P', 'U', 'F', '7'],\n    ['R', 'L', '3', 'F']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = [','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and print the result in the desired format. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output is a list of strings, each representing a row of the rotated matrix. The result matches the expected transformation of the original matrix.\n\nTo ensure clarity, let's break down the transformation:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n8 W N K\nP U F 7\nR L 3 F\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n```\nR P 8\nL U W\n3 F N\nF 7 K\n```\n\nEach row of the rotated matrix corresponds to a column of the original matrix, read from bottom to top.\n\nThe code correctly implements this transformation using Python's `zip` function and list slicing. The `zip(*matrix[::-1])` operation effectively rotates the matrix by transposing and reversing the rows.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<R,P,8,L,U,W,3,F,N,F,7,K>>>"
