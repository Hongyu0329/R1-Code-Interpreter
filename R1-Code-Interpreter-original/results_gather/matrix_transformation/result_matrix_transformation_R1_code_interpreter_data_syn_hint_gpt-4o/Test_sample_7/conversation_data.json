    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nZ C\nR U\n```\n\nThe matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['Z', 'C'],\n  ['R', 'U']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to position (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to position (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to position (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to position (1,0).\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\n[\n  ['R', 'Z'],\n  ['U', 'C']\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'C'],\n    ['R', 'U']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the output matches the expected transformation of the matrix when rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output `['R', 'Z', 'U', 'C']` represents the rotated matrix:\n\n```\nR Z\nU C\n```\n\nThis output is consistent with the expected result of rotating the original matrix 90 degrees clockwise. \n\nNow, let's format the final answer according to the specified format:\n\n<<<R,Z,U,C>>>"
