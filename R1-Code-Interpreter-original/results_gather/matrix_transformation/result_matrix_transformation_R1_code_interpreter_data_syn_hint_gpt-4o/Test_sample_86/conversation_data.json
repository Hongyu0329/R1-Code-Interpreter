    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix, which means converting rows into columns.\n2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the given matrix:\n\n```\n[\n    ['&', '!', '$', '*'],\n    ['%', '%', '@', '#'],\n    ['$', '#', '!', '*'],\n    ['&', '&', '#', '&']\n]\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix:\n   - The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.\n\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['&', '!', '$', '*'],\n    ['%', '%', '@', '#'],\n    ['$', '#', '!', '*'],\n    ['&', '&', '#', '&']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result provides the rotated matrix, which is the desired output. The matrix has been successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Now, I will format the result as requested.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['&', '$', '%', '&'],\n    ['&', '#', '%', '!'],\n    ['#', '!', '@', '$'],\n    ['&', '*', '#', '*']\n]\n```\n\nTo format this as a list of values and symbols, we will convert each row into a string and then join them with commas.\n\nThe formatted result is:\n<<<&,$,%,&,&,#,%!,#,!,@,$,&,*,#,*>>>"
