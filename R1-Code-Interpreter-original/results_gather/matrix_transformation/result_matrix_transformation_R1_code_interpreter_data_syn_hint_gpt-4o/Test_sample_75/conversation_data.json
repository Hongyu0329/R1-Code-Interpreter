    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nN 8 C 3\nC L 2 L\nN B L W\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix, which means converting rows into columns.\n2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Transpose the matrix**: \n   - The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.\n\n   Transposed matrix:\n   ```\n   N C N\n   8 L B\n   C 2 L\n   3 L W\n   ```\n\n2. **Reverse each row of the transposed matrix**:\n   - Reverse the order of elements in each row.\n\n   Rotated matrix:\n   ```\n   N C N -> N N C\n   8 L B -> B L 8\n   C 2 L -> L 2 C\n   3 L W -> W L 3\n   ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', '8', 'C', '3'],\n    ['C', 'L', '2', 'L'],\n    ['N', 'B', 'L', 'W']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to match the required output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened format, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the output format does not match the required format. The task requires the output to be in a specific format, such as <<<A,B,C,D>>>. \n\nLet's adjust the code to ensure the output is formatted correctly. We need to convert the list of strings into a single string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', '8', 'C', '3'],\n    ['C', 'L', '2', 'L'],\n    ['N', 'B', 'L', 'W']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to match the required output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Format the result as a string with the required format\nformatted_result = \"<<<\" + \",\".join(flattened_result) + \">>>\"\n\n# Print the formatted result\nprint(formatted_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in the correct format. Let's execute it to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix was rotated correctly and formatted as requested. The output is in the form of a single string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nThe task was to rotate the given 2D array 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format. The code has achieved this, and the output matches the expected result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
