    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n2 J C 3\nE 9 Y A\nW E A V\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row of the original matrix and making it the first column of the new matrix.\n2. Taking the second last row of the original matrix and making it the second column of the new matrix.\n3. Continuing this process for all rows.\n\nThe original matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n    ['2', 'J', 'C', '3'],\n    ['E', '9', 'Y', 'A'],\n    ['W', 'E', 'A', 'V']\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the new matrix will be:\n```\n[\n    ['W', 'E', '2'],\n    ['E', '9', 'J'],\n    ['A', 'Y', 'C'],\n    ['V', 'A', '3']\n]\n```\n\nTo achieve this, we can use Python to manipulate the matrix. Let's write a script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['2', 'J', 'C', '3'],\n    ['E', '9', 'Y', 'A'],\n    ['W', 'E', 'A', 'V']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = [','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and print the result in the desired format. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the expected output. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result was formatted as a list of strings, each representing a row of the rotated matrix.\n\nThe output `['W,E,2', 'E,9,J', 'A,Y,C', 'V,A,3']` corresponds to the rotated matrix:\n```\nW E 2\nE 9 J\nA Y C\nV A 3\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the original matrix. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<W,E,2,E,9,J,A,Y,C,V,A,3>>>"
