    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [N, H, Y, 9],\n    [X, L, W, F],\n    [T, 1, 5, F]\n]\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row, first column (0,0) will move to the first column, last row.\n- The element at the first row, second column (0,1) will move to the second column, last row.\n- This pattern continues for all elements.\n\nThe new position of an element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will be (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'H', 'Y', '9'],\n    ['X', 'L', 'W', 'F'],\n    ['T', '1', '5', 'F']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the output is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. However, the task requires the output to be formatted as a list of values and symbols, representing the 2D array.\n\nLet's format the output correctly and provide the final answer.\n\nThe rotated matrix in 2D form is:\n```\n[\n    ['T', 'X', 'N'],\n    ['1', 'L', 'H'],\n    ['5', 'W', 'Y'],\n    ['F', 'F', '9']\n]\n```\n\nTo match the required output format, we need to represent this 2D array as a single list of values and symbols.\n\nThe correct output format is:\n<<<T,X,N,1,L,H,5,W,Y,F,F,9>>>"
