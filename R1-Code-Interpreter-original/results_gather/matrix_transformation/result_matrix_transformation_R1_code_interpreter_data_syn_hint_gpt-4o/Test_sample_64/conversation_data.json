    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [O, T, 4, E],\n    [O, 4, 2, K],\n    [D, Q, W, Z]\n]\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row and first column (0,0) will move to the first column and last row (0,2).\n- The element at the first row and second column (0,1) will move to the second column and last row (1,2).\n- This pattern continues for all elements.\n\nThe general rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['O', 'T', '4', 'E'],\n    ['O', '4', '2', 'K'],\n    ['D', 'Q', 'W', 'Z']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix using the transformation rule\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list for output\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened list format, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Now, let's format the output as requested, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['D', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['Q', '4', 'T'],\n    ['W', '2', '4'],\n    ['Z', 'K', 'E']\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix into a single list, we get:\n`['D', 'O', 'O', 'Q', '4', 'T', 'W', '2', '4', 'Z', 'K', 'E']`\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<D,O,O,Q,4,T,W,2,4,Z,K,E>>>"
