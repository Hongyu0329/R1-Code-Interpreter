    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n6 2 8\n2 9 7\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n6 2 8\n2 9 7\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n- The first row `6 2 8` becomes the last column:\n  - `6` moves to position (0, 1)\n  - `2` moves to position (1, 1)\n  - `8` moves to position (2, 1)\n\n- The second row `2 9 7` becomes the first column:\n  - `2` moves to position (0, 0)\n  - `9` moves to position (1, 0)\n  - `7` moves to position (2, 0)\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\n2 6\n9 2\n7 8\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this rotation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Number of columns\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    # Perform the rotation\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['6', '2', '8'],\n    ['2', '9', '7']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix in the desired format\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the output format does not match the required format. The task requires the output to be in the format of a list of values and symbols, such as <<<A,B,C,D>>>.\n\nTo address this, I will modify the code to format the output correctly. The rotated matrix should be flattened into a single list of values, separated by commas, and enclosed within <<< and >>>.\n\nLet's update the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Number of columns\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    # Perform the rotation\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['6', '2', '8'],\n    ['2', '9', '7']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix and format the output\nflattened_output = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\nformatted_output = f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_output)}>>>\"\n\n# Print the formatted output\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the correctly formatted output.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix was rotated correctly and formatted as required. The output is in the format of a list of values and symbols, enclosed within <<< and >>>.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n2 6\n9 2\n7 8\n```\n\nFlattened and formatted, it becomes:\n```\n<<<2,6,9,2,7,8>>>\n```\n\nThis matches the expected output format. Therefore, the task is complete, and the final answer is ready.\n\n<<<2,6,9,2,7,8>>>"
