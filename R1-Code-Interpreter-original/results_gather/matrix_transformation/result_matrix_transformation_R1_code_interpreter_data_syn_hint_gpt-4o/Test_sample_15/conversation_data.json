    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nE N\nY J\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. The first column `E, Y` becomes the first row `Y, E`.\n2. The second column `N, J` becomes the second row `J, N`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nY E\nJ N\n```\n\nNow, let's represent this in the required format. The matrix is now:\n```\nY, E\nJ, N\n```\n\nSo, the final answer in the specified format is:\n<<<Y,E,J,N>>>"
