    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [S, P, W],\n  [O, D, A],\n  [M, J, Y]\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'P', 'W'],\n    ['O', 'D', 'A'],\n    ['M', 'J', 'Y']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix using the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix has been successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. \n\nTo provide the final answer in the required format, we need to convert this list into a string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n  ['M', 'O', 'S'],\n  ['J', 'D', 'P'],\n  ['Y', 'A', 'W']\n]\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes: `['M', 'O', 'S', 'J', 'D', 'P', 'Y', 'A', 'W']`.\n\nNow, let's format this result as requested:\n\n<<<'M,O,S,J,D,P,Y,A,W'>>>"
