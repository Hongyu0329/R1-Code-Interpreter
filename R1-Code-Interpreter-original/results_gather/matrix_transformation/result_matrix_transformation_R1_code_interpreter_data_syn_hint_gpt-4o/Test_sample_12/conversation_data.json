    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nL U\nX K\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nHere's the step-by-step transformation:\n\n1. The first column `L, X` becomes the first row `X, L`.\n2. The second column `U, K` becomes the second row `K, U`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nX L\nK U\n```\n\nNow, let's represent this transformation in code to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"L\", \"U\"],\n    [\"X\", \"K\"]\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for the 90-degree clockwise rotation of the given matrix. The matrix transformation was accurately implemented, and the output format is consistent with the requirements.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nL U\nX K\n```\n\nAfter a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the matrix becomes:\n```\nX L\nK U\n```\n\nThe output format as a list of values and symbols is:\n```\nX,L,K,U\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<X,L,K,U>>>"
