    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nJ T\nU B\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nHere's the step-by-step transformation:\n\n1. The first column `J U` becomes the first row `U J`.\n2. The second column `T B` becomes the second row `B T`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nU J\nB T\n```\n\nNow, let's represent this transformation in code to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"J\", \"T\"],\n    [\"U\", \"B\"]\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output as a list of strings\nresult = [\",\".join(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for the rotated matrix. The matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result was formatted as a list of strings.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nJ T\nU B\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nU J\nB T\n```\n\nThe output `['U,J', 'B,T']` represents this rotated matrix, where each string in the list corresponds to a row in the rotated matrix.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<U,J,B,T>>>"
