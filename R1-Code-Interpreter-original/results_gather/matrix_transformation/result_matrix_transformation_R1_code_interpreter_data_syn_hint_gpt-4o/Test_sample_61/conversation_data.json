    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [G, P, 7, L],\n    [I, O, E, 1],\n    [9, 8, X, X]\n]\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row and first column (0,0) moves to the first column and last row (0,2).\n- The element at the first row and second column (0,1) moves to the second column and last row (1,2).\n- This pattern continues for all elements.\n\nThe general rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'P', '7', 'L'],\n    ['I', 'O', 'E', '1'],\n    ['9', '8', 'X', 'X']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result provides the rotated matrix in a flattened form. To present the result in the required format, we need to convert the flattened list into a 2D array format and then format it as a string with commas separating the elements.\n\nThe rotated matrix in 2D form is:\n```\n[\n    ['9', 'I', 'G'],\n    ['8', 'O', 'P'],\n    ['X', 'E', '7'],\n    ['X', '1', 'L']\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's format this 2D array into the required output format.\n\n```python\n# Rotated matrix in 2D form\nrotated_matrix_2d = [\n    ['9', 'I', 'G'],\n    ['8', 'O', 'P'],\n    ['X', 'E', '7'],\n    ['X', '1', 'L']\n]\n\n# Flatten the matrix and join elements with commas\nformatted_result = ','.join([item for sublist in rotated_matrix_2d for item in sublist])\n\n# Print the formatted result\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will format the rotated matrix into the required output format. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it provides the rotated matrix in the required format. The matrix has been successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the elements have been formatted as a single string with commas separating them.\n\nThe final answer, representing the rotated matrix, is:\n\n<<<9,I,G,8,O,P,X,E,7,X,1,L>>>"
