    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nQ R\nJ H\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 matrix. When we rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nFor the given matrix:\n- The first row `Q R` will become the last column of the new matrix.\n- The second row `J H` will become the first column of the new matrix.\n\nThus, the transformation will look like this:\n```\nOriginal:      Rotated:\nQ R            J Q\nJ H            H R\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"Q\", \"R\"],\n    [\"J\", \"H\"]\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the required output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the output is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. The output `['J', 'Q', 'H', 'R']` corresponds to the rotated matrix:\n\n```\nJ Q\nH R\n```\n\nThis matches our expected transformation from the original matrix:\n\n```\nQ R\nJ H\n```\n\nThus, the code has correctly implemented the rotation. The output format is a flattened list, which is consistent with the requirement to return the result as a list of values and symbols.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<J,Q,H,R>>>"
