    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during the rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['^', '&', '@', '%'],\n    ['*', '!', '!', '#'],\n    ['!', '#', '*', '%'],\n    ['*', '$', '^', '@']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['^', '&', '@', '%'],\n    ['*', '!', '!', '#'],\n    ['!', '#', '*', '%'],\n    ['*', '$', '^', '@']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated, but the output format is not as expected. The task requires the output to be in a specific format, which is a list of values and symbols, separated by commas, and enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nLet's correct the output format by joining the elements of the flattened list with commas and enclosing them in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['^', '&', '@', '%'],\n    ['*', '!', '!', '#'],\n    ['!', '#', '*', '%'],\n    ['*', '$', '^', '@']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Format the result as a string with the required format\nformatted_result = \"<<<\" + \",\".join(flattened_result) + \">>>\"\n\n# Print the formatted result\nprint(formatted_result)\n```\n\nThis code will produce the output in the required format. Let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the order of elements in the output does not match the expected result. Let's re-evaluate the rotation logic and ensure that the transformation is applied correctly.\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation should map the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix. Let's verify this logic and ensure the output is formatted correctly.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['^', '&', '@', '%'],\n    ['*', '!', '!', '#'],\n    ['!', '#', '*', '%'],\n    ['*', '$', '^', '@']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Format the result as a string with the required format\nformatted_result = \"<<<\" + \",\".join(flattened_result) + \">>>\"\n\n# Print the formatted result\nprint(formatted_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result. If the output is still incorrect, we may need to re-evaluate the logic or the way the output is being formatted.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the rotation logic is not being applied correctly, resulting in an incorrect order of elements. Let's re-evaluate the rotation process and ensure that the transformation is applied correctly.\n\nThe correct transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation should map the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix. However, the output seems to be incorrect, so let's re-evaluate the logic and ensure the output is formatted correctly.\n\nLet's manually verify the expected output by considering the transformation:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['^', '&', '@', '%'],\n    ['*', '!', '!', '#'],\n    ['!', '#', '*', '%'],\n    ['*', '$', '^', '@']\n]\n```\n\nRotated matrix (90 degrees clockwise):\n```\n[\n    ['*', '!', '^', '^'],\n    ['$', '#', '!', '&'],\n    ['^', '!', '*', '@'],\n    ['@', '%', '#', '%']\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's format this rotated matrix into the required output format: `<<<*,!,^,^,$,#,!,&,^,!,*,@,@,%,#,%>>>`.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's directly provide the final answer.\n\n<<<*,!,^,^,$,#,!,&,^,!,*,@,@,%,#,%>>>"
