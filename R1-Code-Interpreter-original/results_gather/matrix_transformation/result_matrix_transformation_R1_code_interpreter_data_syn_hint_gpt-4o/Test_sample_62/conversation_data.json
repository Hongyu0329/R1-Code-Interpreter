    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nM C K X\n8 7 N C\nQ M V 1\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row of the original matrix and making it the first column of the new matrix.\n2. Taking the second last row of the original matrix and making it the second column of the new matrix.\n3. Continuing this process for all rows.\n\nThe original matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n    ['M', 'C', 'K', 'X'],\n    ['8', '7', 'N', 'C'],\n    ['Q', 'M', 'V', '1']\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix should look like:\n```\n[\n    ['Q', '8', 'M'],\n    ['M', '7', 'C'],\n    ['V', 'N', 'K'],\n    ['1', 'C', 'X']\n]\n```\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'C', 'K', 'X'],\n    ['8', '7', 'N', 'C'],\n    ['Q', 'M', 'V', '1']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for the rotated matrix. The matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result was formatted as a single string with commas separating the elements.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['Q', '8', 'M'],\n    ['M', '7', 'C'],\n    ['V', 'N', 'K'],\n    ['1', 'C', 'X']\n]\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the output: `Q,8,M,M,7,C,V,N,K,1,C,X`.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Q,8,M,M,7,C,V,N,K,1,C,X>>>"
