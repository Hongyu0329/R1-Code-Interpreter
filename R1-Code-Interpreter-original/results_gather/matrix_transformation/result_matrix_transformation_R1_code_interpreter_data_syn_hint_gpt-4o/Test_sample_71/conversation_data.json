    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nL G J M\nB I F K\nF 7 R 3\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row of the original matrix and making it the first column of the new matrix.\n2. Taking the second last row of the original matrix and making it the second column of the new matrix.\n3. Continuing this process for all rows.\n\nThe transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the last row of the original matrix.\n- The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second last row of the original matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', 'G', 'J', 'M'],\n    ['B', 'I', 'F', 'K'],\n    ['F', '7', 'R', '3']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and format the output as required. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the output format was not as expected. The output should be formatted as a list of values and symbols, separated by commas, without any additional formatting.\n\nLet's revisit the problem and ensure that the output is formatted correctly. The task is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and return the result in the specified format.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nL G J M\nB I F K\nF 7 R 3\n```\n\nThe expected rotated matrix should be:\n```\nF B L\n7 I G\nR F J\n3 K M\n```\n\nThe output should be formatted as a single list of values and symbols, separated by commas.\n\nLet's correct the code to ensure the output is formatted correctly.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', 'G', 'J', 'M'],\n    ['B', 'I', 'F', 'K'],\n    ['F', '7', 'R', '3']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Flattening the rotated matrix and formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([element for row in rotated_matrix for element in row])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and format the output as a single list of values and symbols, separated by commas.
