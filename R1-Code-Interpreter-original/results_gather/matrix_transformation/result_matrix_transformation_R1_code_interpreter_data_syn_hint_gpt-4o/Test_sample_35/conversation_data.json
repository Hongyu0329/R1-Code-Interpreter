    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n4 3 3\n3 5 1\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nFor a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's apply this logic to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n4 3 3\n3 5 1\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n- The first row `[4, 3, 3]` becomes the last column:\n  - `4` goes to position `(0, 2)`\n  - `3` goes to position `(1, 2)`\n  - `3` goes to position `(2, 2)`\n\n- The second row `[3, 5, 1]` becomes the second-to-last column:\n  - `3` goes to position `(0, 1)`\n  - `5` goes to position `(1, 1)`\n  - `1` goes to position `(2, 1)`\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\n3 4\n5 3\n1 3\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this rotation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\n    m = len(matrix)\n    n = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][m - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 3, 3],\n    [3, 5, 1]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n3 4\n5 3\n1 3\n```\n\nThis result aligns with the transformation logic we discussed earlier. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix, and the second row becomes the second-to-last column.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<3,4,5,3,1,3>>>"
