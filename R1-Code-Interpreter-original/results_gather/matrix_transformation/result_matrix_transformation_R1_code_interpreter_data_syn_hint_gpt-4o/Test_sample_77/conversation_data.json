    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [X, 4, 2, N],\n  [H, 1, 7, 2],\n  [M, 8, K, I]\n]\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix.\n- And so on.\n\nFor a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['X', '4', '2', 'N'],\n    ['H', '1', '7', '2'],\n    ['M', '8', 'K', 'I']\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nm = len(matrix)\nn = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions n x m\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][m-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values and symbols\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format.",
    "The code execution result seems to have produced the correct output for the rotated matrix. Let's verify the steps and ensure the logic is sound:\n\n1. **Original Matrix:**\n   ```\n   [\n     [X, 4, 2, N],\n     [H, 1, 7, 2],\n     [M, 8, K, I]\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotation Logic:**\n   - The first row `[X, 4, 2, N]` becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n   - The second row `[H, 1, 7, 2]` becomes the second last column.\n   - The third row `[M, 8, K, I]` becomes the first column.\n\n3. **Rotated Matrix:**\n   ```\n   [\n     [M, H, X],\n     [8, 1, 4],\n     [K, 7, 2],\n     [I, 2, N]\n   ]\n   ```\n\n4. **Flattened Result:**\n   - The flattened result of the rotated matrix is `M, H, X, 8, 1, 4, K, 7, 2, I, 2, N`.\n\nThe code correctly implements the logic for rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and outputs the result in the specified format. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<M,H,X,8,1,4,K,7,2,I,2,N>>>"
