    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nS V\nU O\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n\n1. **Transpose the Matrix**: Convert rows into columns. The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.\n   - Transpose of the given matrix:\n     ```\n     S U\n     V O\n     ```\n\n2. **Reverse Each Row**: After transposing, reverse each row to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n   - Reversing each row of the transposed matrix:\n     ```\n     U S\n     O V\n     ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic using Python code to ensure the transformation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'V'],\n    ['U', 'O']\n]\n\n# Step 1: Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Step 2: Reverse each row in the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given 2D array 90 degrees clockwise. The process involved transposing the matrix and then reversing each row, which is a standard approach for this type of matrix transformation.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n```\nU S\nO V\n```\n\nThis can be represented in the required format as:\n<<<U,S,O,V>>>"
