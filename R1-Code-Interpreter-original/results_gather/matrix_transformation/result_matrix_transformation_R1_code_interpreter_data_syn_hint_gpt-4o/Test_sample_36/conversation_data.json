    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [8, 9, 1],\n  [3, 8, 3]\n]\n```\n\nThe rotation of this matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves the following steps:\n1. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n2. The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix, and so on.\n\nFor a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's apply this logic to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n[\n  [8, 9, 1],\n  [3, 8, 3]\n]\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n- The first row `[8, 9, 1]` becomes the last column `[3, 8]`.\n- The second row `[3, 8, 3]` becomes the second-to-last column `[8, 9]`.\n- The third row (if it existed) would become the first column.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\n[\n  [3, 8],\n  [8, 9],\n  [3, 1]\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this rotation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\n    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions n x m\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix with the appropriate elements\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][m - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 9, 1],\n    [3, 8, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix:\n\n```\n[\n  [8, 9, 1],\n  [3, 8, 3]\n]\n```\n\nwas successfully transformed into:\n\n```\n[\n  [3, 8],\n  [8, 9],\n  [3, 1]\n]\n```\n\nThis transformation aligns with the logic of rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, where each element `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nSince the code execution result is correct and there are no errors, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<3,8,8,9,3,1>>>"
