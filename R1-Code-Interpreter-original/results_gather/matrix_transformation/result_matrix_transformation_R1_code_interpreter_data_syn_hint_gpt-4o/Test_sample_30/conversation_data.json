    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [6, 1, 7],\n  [9, 5, 1]\n]\n```\n\nThe rotation of this matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves the following steps:\n1. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n2. The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix.\n\nFor a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 1, 7],\n    [9, 5, 1]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nm = len(matrix)\nn = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions n x m\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][m - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the matrix has been successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The original matrix:\n\n```\n[\n  [6, 1, 7],\n  [9, 5, 1]\n]\n```\n\nhas been transformed into:\n\n```\n[\n  [9, 6],\n  [5, 1],\n  [1, 7]\n]\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation. Now, I will format the result as requested.\n\nThe rotated matrix is represented as a list of values and symbols, where each row is separated by a comma. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9,6,5,1,1,7>>>"
