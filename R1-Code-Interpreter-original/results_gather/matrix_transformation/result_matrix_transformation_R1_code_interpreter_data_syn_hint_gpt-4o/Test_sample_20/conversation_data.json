    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n7 4 8\n7 5 4\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['7', '4', '8'],\n  ['7', '5', '4']\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\n1. The original matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.\n2. The rotated matrix will have 3 rows and 2 columns.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['7', '4', '8'],\n    ['7', '5', '4']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the output was flattened into a list. The result `['7', '7', '5', '4', '4', '8']` corresponds to the rotated matrix:\n\n```\n7 7\n5 4\n4 8\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the original matrix:\n\nOriginal:\n```\n7 4 8\n7 5 4\n```\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\n7 7\n5 4\n4 8\n```\n\nThe output is correct, and the task has been completed successfully. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7,7,5,4,4,8>>>"
