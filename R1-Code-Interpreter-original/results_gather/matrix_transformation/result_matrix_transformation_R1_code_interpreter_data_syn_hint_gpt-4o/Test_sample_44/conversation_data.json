    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [T, K, M],\n  [C, M, A],\n  [X, U, I]\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and the third row becomes the first column. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'K', 'M'],\n    ['C', 'M', 'A'],\n    ['X', 'U', 'I']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated version\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Apply the transformation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_rotated_matrix)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the output format was not as expected. The task requires the output to be a list of values and symbols, representing the rotated 2D array. The code correctly rotated the matrix, but the output format needs to be adjusted to match the required format.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the output format. The task specifies that the output should be a list of values and symbols, which implies that the result should be presented as a 2D array structure, not a flattened list.\n\nTo address this, we need to ensure that the output reflects the 2D structure of the rotated matrix. Let's adjust the code to print the rotated matrix in the correct format.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'K', 'M'],\n    ['C', 'M', 'A'],\n    ['X', 'U', 'I']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated version\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Apply the transformation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nformatted_output = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in the correct 2D array format.",
