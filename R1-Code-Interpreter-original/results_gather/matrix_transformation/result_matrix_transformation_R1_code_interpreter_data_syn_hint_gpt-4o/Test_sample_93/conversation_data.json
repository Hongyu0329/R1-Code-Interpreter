    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['%', '%', '^', '*'],\n    ['#', '&', '^', '&'],\n    ['@', '@', '@', '^'],\n    ['^', '!', '@', '$']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix, the second row of the new matrix will be the second last column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the following steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['%', '%', '^', '*'],\n    ['#', '&', '^', '&'],\n    ['@', '@', '@', '^'],\n    ['^', '!', '@', '$']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result provided the rotated matrix as expected. The process of transposing the matrix and then reversing each row of the transposed matrix effectively rotates the original matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested. The result from the code execution is:\n```\n[['^', '@', '#', '%'], ['!', '@', '&', '%'], ['@', '@', '^', '^'], ['$', '^', '&', '*']]\n```\n\nTo format this as a list of values and symbols, we will convert each row into a string and then join them with commas.\n\nHere's the formatted result:\n<<<^,@,#,%,!,@,&,%,@,@,^,^,$,^,&,*>>>"
