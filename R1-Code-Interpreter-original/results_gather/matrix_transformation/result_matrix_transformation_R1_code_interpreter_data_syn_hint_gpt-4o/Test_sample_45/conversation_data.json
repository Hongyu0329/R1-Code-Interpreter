    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nF K I\nF Q Y\nC I E\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix, the second row of the new matrix will be the second-to-last column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. The first row of the new matrix will be `C F F` (from the last column of the original matrix).\n2. The second row of the new matrix will be `I Q K` (from the second-to-last column of the original matrix).\n3. The third row of the new matrix will be `E Y I` (from the first column of the original matrix).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this transformation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n    return [''.join(row) for row in zip(*matrix[::-1])]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    \"FKI\",\n    \"FQY\",\n    \"CIE\"\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result shows that the matrix was rotated correctly, but the output format does not match the required format. The task requires the output to be in the format of a list of values and symbols, separated by commas, and enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nLet's adjust the output format to match the requirement. We need to convert the list of strings into a single string with each character separated by a comma.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n    return [''.join(row) for row in zip(*matrix[::-1])]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    \"FKI\",\n    \"FQY\",\n    \"CIE\"\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the result as required\nformatted_result = ','.join(','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix)\n\n# Print the formatted result\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_result}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the correctly formatted output.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the output is formatted as required. The matrix has been successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result is presented in the specified format.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n```\nC F F\nI Q K\nE Y I\n```\n\nAnd the formatted output is:\n<<<C,F,F,I,Q,K,E,Y,I>>>\n\nThis matches the expected result for the task. Therefore, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
