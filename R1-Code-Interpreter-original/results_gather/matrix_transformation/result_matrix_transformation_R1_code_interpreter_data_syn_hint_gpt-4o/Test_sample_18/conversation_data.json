    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nC Z\nI U\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as a 2D list:\n```\n[\n  ['C', 'Z'],\n  ['I', 'U']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to (1,0).\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\n[\n  ['I', 'C'],\n  ['U', 'Z']\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this transformation using Python code to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['C', 'Z'],\n    ['I', 'U']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output as a list of values and symbols\nresult = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for the rotated matrix. The matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, resulting in the list `['I', 'C', 'U', 'Z']`.\n\nThe transformation was achieved by reversing the rows of the original matrix and then transposing it using the `zip` function. This approach is efficient for small matrices like the one given.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<I,C,U,Z>>>"
