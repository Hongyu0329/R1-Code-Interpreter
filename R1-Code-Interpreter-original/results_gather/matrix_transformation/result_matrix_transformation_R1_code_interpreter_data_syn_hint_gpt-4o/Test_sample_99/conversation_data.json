    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n@ ^ * !\n# # ! @\n# # & $\n* ^ $ %\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix, which means converting rows into columns.\n2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Transpose the matrix**: \n   - The first row `[@, ^, *, !]` becomes the first column.\n   - The second row `[#, #, !, @]` becomes the second column.\n   - The third row `[#, #, &, $]` becomes the third column.\n   - The fourth row `[* ,^, $, %]` becomes the fourth column.\n\n2. **Reverse each row of the transposed matrix**:\n   - The first column `[@, #, #, *]` becomes the first row after reversing.\n   - The second column `[^, #, #, ^]` becomes the second row after reversing.\n   - The third column `[* ,!, &, $]` becomes the third row after reversing.\n   - The fourth column `[!, @, $, %]` becomes the fourth row after reversing.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['@', '^', '*', '!'],\n    ['#', '#', '!', '@'],\n    ['#', '#', '&', '$'],\n    ['*', '^', '$', '%']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code execution result provides the rotated matrix, which matches the expected transformation of the original matrix when rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The process involved transposing the matrix and then reversing each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nNow, let's format the result as requested, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>. The output from the code is:\n\n```\n[['*', '#', '#', '@'], ['^', '#', '#', '^'], ['$', '&', '!', '*'], ['%', '$', '@', '!']]\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the rotated matrix:\n\n```\n* # # @\n^ # # ^\n$ & ! *\n% $ @ !\n```\n\nFormatted as a list of values and symbols, the result is:\n\n<<<*,#, #,@,^,#,#,^,$,&,!,*,%, $, @, !>>>"
