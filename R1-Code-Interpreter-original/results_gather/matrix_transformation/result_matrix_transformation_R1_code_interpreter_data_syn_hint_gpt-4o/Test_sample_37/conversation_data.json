    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [6, 9, 6],\n  [4, 7, 2]\n]\n```\n\nThe matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns. When rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix will have 3 rows and 2 columns. The transformation rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is as follows:\n\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n[\n  [6, 9, 6],\n  [4, 7, 2]\n]\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n- The element at (0, 0) -> (0, 1) becomes 6\n- The element at (0, 1) -> (1, 1) becomes 9\n- The element at (0, 2) -> (2, 1) becomes 6\n- The element at (1, 0) -> (0, 0) becomes 4\n- The element at (1, 1) -> (1, 0) becomes 7\n- The element at (1, 2) -> (2, 0) becomes 2\n\nThe rotated matrix will be:\n```\n[\n  [4, 6],\n  [7, 9],\n  [2, 6]\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this transformation using Python code to verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 9, 6],\n    [4, 7, 2]\n]\n\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\nprint(rotated)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result matches our expected output, which means the code correctly rotates the matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The transformation logic applied in the code is consistent with the mathematical understanding of rotating a matrix.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n[\n  [6, 9, 6],\n  [4, 7, 2]\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix is:\n```\n[\n  [4, 6],\n  [7, 9],\n  [2, 6]\n]\n```\n\nThis confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4,6,7,9,2,6>>>"
