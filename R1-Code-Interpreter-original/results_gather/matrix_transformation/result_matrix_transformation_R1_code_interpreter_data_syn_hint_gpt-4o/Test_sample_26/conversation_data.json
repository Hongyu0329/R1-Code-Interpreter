    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n4 2 9\n9 4 7\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. The first row `[4, 2, 9]` becomes the last column:\n   - 4 goes to the position (0, 1)\n   - 2 goes to the position (1, 1)\n   - 9 goes to the position (2, 1)\n\n2. The second row `[9, 4, 7]` becomes the first column:\n   - 9 goes to the position (0, 0)\n   - 4 goes to the position (1, 0)\n   - 7 goes to the position (2, 0)\n\nThe resulting matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation will be:\n```\n9 4\n4 2\n7 9\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to confirm our understanding and get the final result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n    return [list(reversed(col)) for col in zip(*matrix)]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['4', '2', '9'],\n    ['9', '4', '7']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to match the output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the matrix was not rotated correctly. The issue arises from the incorrect placement of elements during the rotation process. Let's revisit the logic and correct the code.\n\nThe correct approach to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's correct the code and ensure it outputs the matrix in the correct format.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n    return [list(reversed(col)) for col in zip(*matrix)]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['4', '2', '9'],\n    ['9', '4', '7']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nformatted_result = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_result}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected code to get the final result.",
