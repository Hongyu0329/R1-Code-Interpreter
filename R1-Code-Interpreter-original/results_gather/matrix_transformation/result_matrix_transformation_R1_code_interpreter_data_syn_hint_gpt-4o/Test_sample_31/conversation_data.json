    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n7 4 6\n6 9 4\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['7', '4', '6'],\n  ['6', '9', '4']\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\n1. The element '7' at position (0, 0) will move to position (0, 1).\n2. The element '4' at position (0, 1) will move to position (1, 1).\n3. The element '6' at position (0, 2) will move to position (2, 1).\n4. The element '6' at position (1, 0) will move to position (0, 0).\n5. The element '9' at position (1, 1) will move to position (1, 0).\n6. The element '4' at position (1, 2) will move to position (2, 0).\n\nThe resulting matrix after rotation will be:\n```\n6 7\n9 4\n4 6\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this rotation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    # Perform the rotation\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['7', '4', '6'],\n    ['6', '9', '4']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix:\n\n```\n7 4 6\n6 9 4\n```\n\nwas successfully transformed into:\n\n```\n6 7\n9 4\n4 6\n```\n\nThis confirms that the logic applied in the code is correct. The transformation of indices was accurately implemented, and the resulting matrix is as expected.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<6,7,9,4,4,6>>>"
