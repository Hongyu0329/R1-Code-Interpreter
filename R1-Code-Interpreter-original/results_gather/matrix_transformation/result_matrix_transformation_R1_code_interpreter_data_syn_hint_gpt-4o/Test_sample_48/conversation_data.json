    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [F, M, R],\n    [M, Q, W],\n    [H, S, C]\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['F', 'M', 'R'],\n    ['M', 'Q', 'W'],\n    ['H', 'S', 'C']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty values\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list of values\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_rotated_matrix)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the rotated matrix and print it in the required format. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The transformation logic was applied correctly, and the output format is as specified.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n[\n    [F, M, R],\n    [M, Q, W],\n    [H, S, C]\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n[\n    [H, M, F],\n    [S, Q, M],\n    [C, W, R]\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix row by row gives us the sequence: H, M, F, S, Q, M, C, W, R.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<H,M,F,S,Q,M,C,W,R>>>"
