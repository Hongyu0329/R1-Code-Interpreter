    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The original matrix is:\n\n```\nK P E 3\nY 2 P S\nL J U 3\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows into columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is a 3x4 matrix.\n- After transposing, the matrix will become a 4x3 matrix.\n- Then, reversing each row of the transposed matrix will give us the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['K', 'P', 'E', '3'],\n    ['Y', '2', 'P', 'S'],\n    ['L', 'J', 'U', '3']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to match the required output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the output, which represents the rotated matrix. However, the output format needs to be adjusted to match the required format, which is a comma-separated list of values and symbols enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nThe rotated matrix, based on the output, is:\n\n```\nL Y K\nJ 2 P\nU P E\n3 S 3\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix into a single list gives us: `['L', 'Y', 'K', 'J', '2', 'P', 'U', 'P', 'E', '3', 'S', '3']`.\n\nNow, let's format this result correctly:\n\n<<<L,Y,K,J,2,P,U,P,E,3,S,3>>>"
