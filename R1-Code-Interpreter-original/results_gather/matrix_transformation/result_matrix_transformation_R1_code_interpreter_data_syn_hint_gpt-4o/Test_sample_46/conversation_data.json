    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nN U L\nM C A\nQ S T\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The third row of the original matrix becomes the first column of the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n2. The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n3. The third column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nQ M N\nS C U\nT A L\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this rotation and verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the rotated matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'U', 'L'],\n    ['M', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['Q', 'S', 'T']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_output = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and format the output as requested.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected output for rotating the given 2D array 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix transformation was performed accurately, and the output was formatted as requested.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nN U L\nM C A\nQ S T\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nQ M N\nS C U\nT A L\n```\n\nThe formatted output is:\n```\n<<<Q,M,N,S,C,U,T,A,L>>>\n```\n\nSince the code execution result is correct and there are no errors, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<Q,M,N,S,C,U,T,A,L>>>"
