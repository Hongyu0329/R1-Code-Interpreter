    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [5, 9, 4],\n  [8, 2, 1]\n]\n```\n\nThe matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns. When rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix will have 3 rows and 2 columns. The transformation rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is as follows:\n\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n\n1. The element at (0, 0) which is 5 will move to (0, 1).\n2. The element at (0, 1) which is 9 will move to (1, 1).\n3. The element at (0, 2) which is 4 will move to (2, 1).\n4. The element at (1, 0) which is 8 will move to (0, 0).\n5. The element at (1, 1) which is 2 will move to (1, 0).\n6. The element at (1, 2) which is 1 will move to (2, 0).\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['5', '9', '4'],\n    ['8', '2', '1']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Apply the transformation\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and output the result in the specified format. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the output matches the expected transformation of the matrix when rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix:\n\n```\n[\n  [5, 9, 4],\n  [8, 2, 1]\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotated 90 degrees clockwise, becomes:\n\n```\n[\n  [8, 5],\n  [2, 9],\n  [1, 4]\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix into a list of values gives us the sequence: 8, 5, 2, 9, 1, 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8,5,2,9,1,4>>>"
