    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nM J B\nT V R\nM B E\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix, the second row of the new matrix will be the second-to-last column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. The first row of the rotated matrix will be the last column of the original matrix: `M, T, M` becomes `M, T, M`.\n2. The second row of the rotated matrix will be the second-to-last column of the original matrix: `J, V, B` becomes `J, V, B`.\n3. The third row of the rotated matrix will be the first column of the original matrix: `B, R, E` becomes `B, R, E`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nM T M\nJ V B\nB R E\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"M\", \"J\", \"B\"],\n    [\"T\", \"V\", \"R\"],\n    [\"M\", \"B\", \"E\"]\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output is not as expected. The issue arises from the incorrect order of elements in the rotated matrix. Let's revisit the logic and correct the code.\n\nThe correct approach to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix.\n2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic correctly in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"M\", \"J\", \"B\"],\n    [\"T\", \"V\", \"R\"],\n    [\"M\", \"B\", \"E\"]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the correct rotated matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output is still incorrect. Let's carefully analyze the problem and correct the approach.\n\nThe task is to rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The correct steps are:\n1. Transpose the matrix: This means converting rows into columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's ensure the code reflects this logic accurately:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"M\", \"J\", \"B\"],\n    [\"T\", \"V\", \"R\"],\n    [\"M\", \"B\", \"E\"]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Formatting the output\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the correct rotated matrix.",
