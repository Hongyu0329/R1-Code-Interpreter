    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n9 H B X\nS X T 6\nU V N 6\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row and making it the first column.\n2. Taking the second last row and making it the second column.\n3. Continuing this process until the first row becomes the last column.\n\nThe original matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n    ['9', 'H', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['S', 'X', 'T', '6'],\n    ['U', 'V', 'N', '6']\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix should look like:\n```\n[\n    ['U', 'S', '9'],\n    ['V', 'X', 'H'],\n    ['N', 'T', 'B'],\n    ['6', '6', 'X']\n]\n```\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a simple algorithm:\n- Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row in the transposed matrix\n    rotated = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed]\n    return rotated\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['9', 'H', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['S', 'X', 'T', '6'],\n    ['U', 'V', 'N', '6']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as requested\nformatted_output = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and format the output as requested. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the matrix was successfully rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the output was formatted correctly. The result matches the expected transformation of the matrix.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['9', 'H', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['S', 'X', 'T', '6'],\n    ['U', 'V', 'N', '6']\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n[\n    ['U', 'S', '9'],\n    ['V', 'X', 'H'],\n    ['N', 'T', 'B'],\n    ['6', '6', 'X']\n]\n```\n\nThe formatted output is:\n```\n<<<U,S,9,V,X,H,N,T,B,6,6,X>>>\n```\n\nThis output is consistent with the expected result of the rotation. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n<<<'U,S,9,V,X,H,N,T,B,6,6,X'>>>"
