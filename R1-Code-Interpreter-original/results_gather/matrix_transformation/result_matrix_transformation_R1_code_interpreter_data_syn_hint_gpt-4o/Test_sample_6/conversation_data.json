    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nF J\nU T\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n\n1. **Transpose the Matrix**: Convert rows into columns. The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.\n   - Transpose of the given matrix:\n     ```\n     F U\n     J T\n     ```\n\n2. **Reverse Each Row**: After transposing, reverse each row to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n   - Reversing each row of the transposed matrix:\n     ```\n     U F\n     T J\n     ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['F', 'J'],\n    ['U', 'T']\n]\n\n# Step 1: Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Step 2: Reverse each row in the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Prepare the result in the required format\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. The process of rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise was implemented by transposing the matrix and then reversing each row. The result was formatted as a comma-separated string, which matches the required output format.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n```\nU F\nT J\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the output: `U,F,T,J`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<U,F,T,J>>>"
