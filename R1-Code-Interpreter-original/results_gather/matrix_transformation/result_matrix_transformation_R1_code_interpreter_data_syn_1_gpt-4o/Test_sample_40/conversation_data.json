    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [S, Z, M],\n    [S, D, F],\n    [V, W, X]\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'Z', 'M'],\n    ['S', 'D', 'F'],\n    ['V', 'W', 'X']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty strings\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list for the output\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the flattened version of the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result is presented as a single list of elements.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n[\n    [S, Z, M],\n    [S, D, F],\n    [V, W, X]\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n[\n    [V, S, S],\n    [W, D, Z],\n    [X, F, M]\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix results in the list: `['V', 'S', 'S', 'W', 'D', 'Z', 'X', 'F', 'M']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<V,S,S,W,D,Z,X,F,M>>>"
