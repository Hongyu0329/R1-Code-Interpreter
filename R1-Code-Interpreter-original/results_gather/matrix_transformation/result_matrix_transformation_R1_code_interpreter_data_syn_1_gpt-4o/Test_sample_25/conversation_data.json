    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given matrix element at position (i, j), after a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it will move to the position (j, n-1-i), where n is the number of rows in the matrix. This transformation effectively rotates the matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Determine the dimensions of the matrix.\n2. Create a new matrix to store the rotated result.\n3. Iterate over each element of the original matrix and place it in the new position in the rotated matrix.\n4. Print the rotated matrix in the specified format.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n6 7 5\n9 2 4\n```\n\nWe will apply the above steps to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"6\", \"7\", \"5\"],\n    [\"9\", \"2\", \"4\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[\"\" for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix and format the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output as requested.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n9 6\n2 7\n4 5\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix into a list, we get: `['9', '6', '2', '7', '4', '5']`.\n\nNow, let's format the output in the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\n<<<9,6,2,7,4,5>>>"
