    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, after a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it will be positioned at (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Determine the dimensions of the original matrix. In this case, it's a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n2. Create a new matrix with dimensions 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns) to accommodate the rotated elements.\n3. Iterate over each element in the original matrix and place it in the correct position in the new matrix using the transformation rule mentioned above.\n4. Output the new matrix in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', '1', '9', 'M'],\n    ['T', 'J', '9', 'G'],\n    ['Z', 'X', 'U', 'U']\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix and format the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. Now, let's interpret the result and format it according to the specified output format.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nL 1 9 M\nT J 9 G\nZ X U U\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nZ T L\nX J 1\nU 9 9\nU G M\n```\n\nThe flattened result of this rotated matrix is:\n```\n['Z', 'T', 'L', 'X', 'J', '1', 'U', '9', '9', 'U', 'G', 'M']\n```\n\nNow, let's format this result as requested:\n\n<<<Z,T,L,X,J,1,U,9,9,U,G,M>>>"
