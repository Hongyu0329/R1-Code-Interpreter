    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nX 4 2 N\nH 1 7 2\nM 8 K I\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nFor a 3x4 matrix, the rotated matrix will be 4x3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. The first row `['X', '4', '2', 'N']` becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n2. The second row `['H', '1', '7', '2']` becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n3. The third row `['M', '8', 'K', 'I']` becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['X', '4', '2', 'N'],\n    ['H', '1', '7', '2'],\n    ['M', '8', 'K', 'I']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[c][rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix as a flattened list. The output represents the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nX 4 2 N\nH 1 7 2\nM 8 K I\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nM H X\n8 1 4\nK 7 2\nI 2 N\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix row by row gives us the list: `['M', 'H', 'X', '8', '1', '4', 'K', '7', '2', 'I', '2', 'N']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<M,H,X,8,1,4,K,7,2,I,2,N>>>"
