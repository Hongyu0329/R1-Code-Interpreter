    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n2. Reversing the order of elements in each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the given matrix:\n\n```\n[\n    ['%', '!', '@', '!'],\n    ['$', '^', '%', '@'],\n    ['!', '@', '#', '#'],\n    ['@', '&', '!', '@']\n]\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix:\n   - The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.\n\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to achieve the 90-degree rotation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['%', '!', '@', '!'],\n    ['$', '^', '%', '@'],\n    ['!', '@', '#', '#'],\n    ['@', '&', '!', '@']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened form, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the flattened version of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result as requested.\n\nThe output list represents the 2D array after a 90-degree clockwise rotation. We need to format it as a list of values and symbols, separated by commas.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['@', '!', '$', '%'],\n    ['&', '@', '^', '!'],\n    ['!', '#', '%', '@'],\n    ['@', '#', '@', '!']\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix gives us the list: `['@', '!', '$', '%', '&', '@', '^', '!', '!', '#', '%', '@', '@', '#', '@', '!']`.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<@,!, $,%,&,@,^,!,!,#,%,@,@,#,@,!>>>"
