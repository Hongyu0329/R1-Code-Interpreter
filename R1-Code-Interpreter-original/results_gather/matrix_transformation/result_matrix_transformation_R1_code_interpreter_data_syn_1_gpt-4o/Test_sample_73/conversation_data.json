    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n2 J C 3\nE 9 Y A\nW E A V\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D list in Python:\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    ['2', 'J', 'C', '3'],\n    ['E', '9', 'Y', 'A'],\n    ['W', 'E', 'A', 'V']\n]\n```\n\nThe rotated matrix should look like:\n```\nW E 2\nE 9 J\nA Y C\nV A 3\n```\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the following approach:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['2', 'J', 'C', '3'],\n    ['E', '9', 'Y', 'A'],\n    ['W', 'E', 'A', 'V']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Let's execute it to see the result."
