    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nN 8 C 3\nC L 2 L\nN B L W\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the last row of the original matrix and making it the first column of the new matrix.\n2. Taking the second last row of the original matrix and making it the second column of the new matrix.\n3. Continuing this process until the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n- The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n- The third column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', '8', 'C', '3'],\n    ['C', 'L', '2', 'L'],\n    ['N', 'B', 'L', 'W']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(cols):\n    for j in range(rows):\n        rotated_matrix[i][j] = matrix[rows - j - 1][i]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a flattened list representing the rotated matrix. Now, let's interpret this result into the required format.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nN 8 C 3\nC L 2 L\nN B L W\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nN C N\nB L 8\nL 2 C\nW L 3\n```\n\nThe flattened list output from the code is `['N', 'C', 'N', 'B', 'L', '8', 'L', '2', 'C', 'W', 'L', '3']`, which corresponds to the rotated matrix.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<N,C,N,B,L,8,L,2,C,W,L,3>>>"
