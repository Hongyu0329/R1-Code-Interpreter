    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, after a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it will be positioned at (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, the matrix is 3x3.\n2. Create a new matrix to hold the rotated values. This new matrix will also be 3x3.\n3. Iterate over each element in the original matrix and place it in the correct position in the new matrix according to the transformation rule.\n4. Output the new matrix in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"F\", \"M\", \"R\"],\n    [\"M\", \"Q\", \"W\"],\n    [\"H\", \"S\", \"C\"]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix and format the output\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Now, let's format the output according to the specified format, which is a comma-separated list enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nH M F\nS Q M\nC W R\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes: `['H', 'M', 'F', 'S', 'Q', 'M', 'C', 'W', 'R']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<H,M,F,S,Q,M,C,W,R>>>"
