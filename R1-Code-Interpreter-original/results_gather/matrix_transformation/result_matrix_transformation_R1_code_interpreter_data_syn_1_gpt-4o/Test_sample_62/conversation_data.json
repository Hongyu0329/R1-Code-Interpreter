    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nM C K X\n8 7 N C\nQ M V 1\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n2. The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n3. This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nFor a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns), the rotated matrix will be a 4x3 matrix (4 rows and 3 columns).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The first column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n- The second column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n- The third column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n- The fourth column of the rotated matrix will be the reverse of the fourth row of the original matrix.\n\nTo implement this, we can use Python to perform the transformation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"M\", \"C\", \"K\", \"X\"],\n    [\"8\", \"7\", \"N\", \"C\"],\n    [\"Q\", \"M\", \"V\", \"1\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a flattened list representing the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result is presented as a single list of elements.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nM C K X\n8 7 N C\nQ M V 1\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nQ 8 M M\n7 C V N\nK 1 C X\n```\n\nFlattened, this matrix is represented as:\n```\n['Q', '8', 'M', 'M', '7', 'C', 'V', 'N', 'K', '1', 'C', 'X']\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<Q,8,M,M,7,C,V,N,K,1,C,X>>>"
