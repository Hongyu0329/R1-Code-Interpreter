    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['#', '^', '#', '#'],\n    ['%', '*', '%', '$'],\n    ['&', '!', '&', '*'],\n    ['%', '&', '%', '!']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix, the second row of the new matrix will be the second last column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the following steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['#', '^', '#', '#'],\n    ['%', '*', '%', '$'],\n    ['&', '!', '&', '*'],\n    ['%', '&', '%', '!']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened form, which we can then format as required.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix in a flattened form. Now, let's format this output according to the required format, which is a list of values and symbols separated by commas and enclosed within `<<< >>>`.\n\nThe output from the code is:\n```\n['%', '&', '%', '#', '&', '!', '*', '^', '%', '&', '%', '#', '!', '*', '$', '#']\n```\n\nWe need to convert this list into a string format as specified in the problem statement.\n\n<<<%,&,%,#,&,!,*,^,%,&,%,#,!,*,$,#>>>"
