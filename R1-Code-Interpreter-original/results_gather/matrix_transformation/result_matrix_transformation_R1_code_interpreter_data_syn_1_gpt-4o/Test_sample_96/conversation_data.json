    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise. Let's break down the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix. Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns in a specific order.\n\n2. **Rotation Logic**: \n   - The first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix.\n   - The second row of the new matrix will be the second last column of the original matrix.\n   - This pattern continues until the last row of the new matrix, which will be the first column of the original matrix.\n\n3. **Implementation**: We can implement this logic using Python. We will iterate over the columns of the original matrix from the last to the first and construct the new rows for the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['#', '&', '#', '%'],\n    ['&', '!', '#', '!'],\n    ['&', '$', '$', '*'],\n    ['^', '*', '%', '$']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a flattened list representing the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the final answer according to the specified format.\n\nThe output list `['^', '&', '&', '#', '*', '$', '!', '&', '%', '$', '#', '#', '$', '*', '!', '%']` represents the 2D array after rotating the original matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<^,&,&,#,*, $ ,!,&,%, $, # ,#, $, *,!,%>>>"
