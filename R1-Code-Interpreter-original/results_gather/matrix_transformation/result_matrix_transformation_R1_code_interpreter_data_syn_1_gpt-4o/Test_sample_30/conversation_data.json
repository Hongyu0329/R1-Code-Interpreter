    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n6 1 7\n9 5 1\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: This means converting all rows to columns and vice versa.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  [\n    [6, 1, 7],\n    [9, 5, 1]\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Transpose the matrix:\n  ```\n  [\n    [6, 9],\n    [1, 5],\n    [7, 1]\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix:\n  ```\n  [\n    [9, 6],\n    [5, 1],\n    [1, 7]\n  ]\n  ```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 1, 7],\n    [9, 5, 1]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix:\n\n```\n[[9, 6], [5, 1], [1, 7]]\n```\n\nThis matches our expected result after rotating the original matrix 90 degrees clockwise. \n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<9,6,5,1,1,7>>>"
