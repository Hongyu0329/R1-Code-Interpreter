    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n7 4 8\n7 5 4\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows into columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  7 4 8\n  7 5 4\n  ```\n\n- Transpose the matrix:\n  ```\n  7 7\n  4 5\n  8 4\n  ```\n\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix:\n  ```\n  8 4\n  4 5\n  7 7\n  ```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to ensure the correctness of the transformation.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"7\", \"4\", \"8\"],\n    [\"7\", \"5\", \"4\"]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, resulting in the following configuration:\n\n```\n7 7\n5 4\n4 8\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the flattened list: `['7', '7', '5', '4', '4', '8']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7,7,5,4,4,8>>>"
