    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix:\n```\na b c\nd e f\ng h i\n```\n\nThe 90-degree clockwise rotation results in:\n```\ng d a\nh e b\ni f c\n```\n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n5 9 4\n8 2 1\n```\n\nWe can apply the same transformation:\n- The first row `[5, 9, 4]` becomes the last column `[8, 5]`.\n- The second row `[8, 2, 1]` becomes the first column `[1, 9]`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation and output the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(matrix)\n    num_cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [[None] * num_rows for _ in range(num_cols)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for r in range(num_rows):\n        for c in range(num_cols):\n            rotated_matrix[c][num_rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"5\", \"9\", \"4\"],\n    [\"8\", \"2\", \"1\"]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a list of values and symbols\noutput = []\nfor row in rotated:\n    output.extend(row)\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result in the required format. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output `['8', '5', '2', '9', '1', '4']`. This output represents the rotated matrix in a flattened form, where each element is listed in order from top to bottom, left to right.\n\nTo format the output as requested, we need to present it as a list of values and symbols, separated by commas. Let's format the output accordingly.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n8 5\n2 9\n1 4\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix row by row gives us the list: `['8', '5', '2', '9', '1', '4']`.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<8,5,2,9,1,4>>>"
