    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['!', '^', '*', '@'],\n    ['#', '^', '!', '&'],\n    ['#', '^', '$', '#'],\n    ['@', '^', '!', '&']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['!', '^', '*', '@'],\n    ['#', '^', '!', '&'],\n    ['#', '^', '$', '#'],\n    ['@', '^', '!', '&']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty strings\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the rotated matrix and output it as a flattened list. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result according to the specified format.\n\nThe output list represents the 2D array after a 90-degree clockwise rotation. We need to return this list in the format specified by the user.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['@', '#', '#', '!'],\n    ['^', '^', '^', '^'],\n    ['!', '$', '!', '*'],\n    ['&', '#', '&', '@']\n]\n```\n\nFlattened, it becomes:\n```\n['@', '#', '#', '!', '^', '^', '^', '^', '!', '$', '!', '*', '&', '#', '&', '@']\n```\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<@,#,#,!,^,^,^,^,!,!,*,&,#,&,@>>>"
