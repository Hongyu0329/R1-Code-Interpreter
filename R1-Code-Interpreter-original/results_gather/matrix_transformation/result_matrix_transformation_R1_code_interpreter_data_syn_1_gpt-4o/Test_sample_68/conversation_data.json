    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nN H Y 9\nX L W F\nT 1 5 F\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the first column from the bottom to the top and making it the first row.\n2. Taking the second column from the bottom to the top and making it the second row.\n3. Continuing this process for all columns.\n\nFor the given matrix, the transformation would look like this:\n- The first column `N, X, T` becomes the first row `T, X, N`.\n- The second column `H, L, 1` becomes the second row `1, L, H`.\n- The third column `Y, W, 5` becomes the third row `5, W, Y`.\n- The fourth column `9, F, F` becomes the fourth row `F, F, 9`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure the transformation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'H', 'Y', '9'],\n    ['X', 'L', 'W', 'F'],\n    ['T', '1', '5', 'F']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows-1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix in a flattened form. Now, let's format the result according to the specified format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe output from the code is:\n```\n['T', 'X', 'N', '1', 'L', 'H', '5', 'W', 'Y', 'F', 'F', '9']\n```\n\nThis represents the rotated matrix:\n```\nT X N\n1 L H\n5 W Y\nF F 9\n```\n\nNow, let's format this as requested:\n\n<<<T,X,N,1,L,H,5,W,Y,F,F,9>>>"
