    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nW T\nZ B\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n2. The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the new matrix, and so on.\n\nFor the given matrix:\n```\nW T\nZ B\n```\n\nThe transformation would be:\n- The first row `W T` becomes the last column `T B`.\n- The second row `Z B` becomes the first column `W Z`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix should look like:\n```\nZ W\nB T\n```\n\nTo implement this transformation, we can use Python to manipulate the matrix. Let's write a script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"W\", \"T\"],\n    [\"Z\", \"B\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Now, let's format the output according to the specified format.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nZ W\nB T\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes `['Z', 'W', 'B', 'T']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<Z,W,B,T>>>"
