    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n7 1 1\n5 3 8\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as a 2D list in Python:\n\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    ['7', '1', '1'],\n    ['5', '3', '8']\n]\n```\n\nTo rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to transform the rows into columns. The first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['7', '1', '1'],\n    ['5', '3', '8']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Convert tuples to lists and join elements to form the final output\nresult = [','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the rotated matrix."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a 2D array of strings, which represents a letter matrix.
