    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [2, 1, 3],\n  [3, 7, 7]\n]\n```\n\nThe matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns. When we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix will have 3 rows and 2 columns. The transformation of indices can be described as follows:\n\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 1, 3],\n    [3, 7, 7]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * rows for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [str(item) for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output in the required format. The rotated matrix is represented as a flat list of values, which corresponds to the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n[\n  [2, 1, 3],\n  [3, 7, 7]\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotated 90 degrees clockwise, becomes:\n```\n[\n  [3, 2],\n  [7, 1],\n  [7, 3]\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix results in the list: `3, 2, 7, 1, 7, 3`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3,2,7,1,7,3>>>"
