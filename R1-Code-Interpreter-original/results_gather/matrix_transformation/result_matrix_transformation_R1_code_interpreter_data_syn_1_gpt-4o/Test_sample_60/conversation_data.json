    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nA J X X\n9 S 4 7\nR X V T\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n2. The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix, and so on.\n\nFor a 3x4 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The first row `[A, J, X, X]` becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n- The second row `[9, S, 4, 7]` becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n- The third row `[R, X, V, T]` becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"A\", \"J\", \"X\", \"X\"],\n    [\"9\", \"S\", \"4\", \"7\"],\n    [\"R\", \"X\", \"V\", \"T\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix in a flattened format. Now, let's interpret the result and present it in the required format.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nR 9 A\nX S J\nV 4 X\nT 7 X\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes: `['R', '9', 'A', 'X', 'S', 'J', 'V', '4', 'X', 'T', '7', 'X']`.\n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<R,9,A,X,S,J,V,4,X,T,7,X>>>"
