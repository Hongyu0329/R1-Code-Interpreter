    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nW V Z\nP P X\nO J V\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n    ['W', 'V', 'Z'],\n    ['P', 'P', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'J', 'V']\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to position `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['W', 'V', 'Z'],\n    ['P', 'P', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'J', 'V']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix in a flattened form. Now, let's format the output according to the specified format.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nO P W\nJ P V\nV X Z\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes: `['O', 'P', 'W', 'J', 'P', 'V', 'V', 'X', 'Z']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<O,P,W,J,P,V,V,X,Z>>>"
