    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list is a row of the matrix. \n\nThe original matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['%', '%', '^', '*'],\n    ['#', '&', '^', '&'],\n    ['@', '@', '@', '^'],\n    ['^', '!', '@', '$']\n]\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['%', '%', '^', '*'],\n    ['#', '&', '^', '&'],\n    ['@', '@', '@', '^'],\n    ['^', '!', '@', '$']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix as a flattened list. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the flattened list of the rotated matrix. Now, let's interpret this result into the required format.\n\nThe output list represents the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\n[\n    ['^', '@', '#', '%'],\n    ['!', '@', '&', '%'],\n    ['@', '@', '^', '^'],\n    ['$', '^', '&', '*']\n]\n```\n\nThe flattened list `['^', '@', '#', '%', '!', '@', '&', '%', '@', '@', '^', '^', '$', '^', '&', '*']` corresponds to this matrix when read row by row.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<^,@,#,%,!,@,&,%,@,@,^,^,$,^,&,*>>>"
