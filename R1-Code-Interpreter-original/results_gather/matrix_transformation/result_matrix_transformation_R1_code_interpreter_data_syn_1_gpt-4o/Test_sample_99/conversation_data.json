    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['@', '^', '*', '!'],\n    ['#', '#', '!', '@'],\n    ['#', '#', '&', '$'],\n    ['*', '^', '$', '%']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['@', '^', '*', '!'],\n    ['#', '#', '!', '@'],\n    ['#', '#', '&', '$'],\n    ['*', '^', '$', '%']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty strings\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list for output\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. Now, let's interpret this result in the required format.\n\nThe output list `['*', '#', '#', '@', '^', '#', '#', '^', '$', '&', '!', '*', '%', '$', '@', '!']` represents the rotated matrix. We need to format this as a 2D array in the answer.\n\nThe original matrix was 4x4, so the rotated matrix will also be 4x4. We can group the elements into rows of 4 to represent the 2D array:\n\n```\n[\n    ['*', '#', '#', '@'],\n    ['^', '#', '#', '^'],\n    ['$', '&', '!', '*'],\n    ['%', '$', '@', '!']\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['*', '#', '#', '@'], ['^', '#', '#', '^'], ['$', '&', '!', '*'], ['%', '$', '@', '!']>>>"
