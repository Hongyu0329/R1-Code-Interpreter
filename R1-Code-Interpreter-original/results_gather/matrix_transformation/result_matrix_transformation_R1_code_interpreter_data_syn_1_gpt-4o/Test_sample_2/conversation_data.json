    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nW U\nW F\n```\n\nThe matrix is represented as:\n```\n[\n    ['W', 'U'],\n    ['W', 'F']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to (1,0).\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\n[\n    ['W', 'W'],\n    ['F', 'U']\n]\n```\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['W', 'U'],\n    ['W', 'F']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[None] * rows for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[c][rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and output the result in a flattened format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output `['W', 'W', 'F', 'U']`, which represents the rotated matrix. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nW U\nW F\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, becomes:\n```\nW W\nF U\n```\n\nThe flattened version of this matrix is `['W', 'W', 'F', 'U']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<W,W,F,U>>>"
