    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [D, P, M],\n    [Q, J, F],\n    [Z, U, V]\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['D', 'P', 'M'],\n    ['Q', 'J', 'F'],\n    ['Z', 'U', 'V']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty strings\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix as a flattened list. Now, let's format the output according to the specified format, which is a comma-separated list enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['Z', 'Q', 'D'],\n    ['U', 'J', 'P'],\n    ['V', 'F', 'M']\n]\n```\n\nFlattened, it becomes: `['Z', 'Q', 'D', 'U', 'J', 'P', 'V', 'F', 'M']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Z,Q,D,U,J,P,V,F,M>>>"
