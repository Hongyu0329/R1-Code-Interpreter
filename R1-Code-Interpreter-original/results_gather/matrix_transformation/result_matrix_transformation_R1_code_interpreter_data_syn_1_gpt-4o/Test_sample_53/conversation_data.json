    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nN A V\nF S D\nR U X\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'A', 'V'],\n    ['F', 'S', 'D'],\n    ['R', 'U', 'X']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty strings\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. The result is a flattened list representing the matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nN A V\nF S D\nR U X\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nR F N\nU S A\nX D V\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix into a single list gives us the output: `['R', 'F', 'N', 'U', 'S', 'A', 'X', 'D', 'V']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<R,F,N,U,S,A,X,D,V>>>"
