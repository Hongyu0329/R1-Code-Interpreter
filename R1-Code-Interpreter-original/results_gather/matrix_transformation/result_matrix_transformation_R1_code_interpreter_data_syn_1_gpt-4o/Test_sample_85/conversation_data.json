    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n2. Reversing the order of elements in each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the given matrix:\n\n```\n@ * $ &\n^ $ & $\n! $ @ $\n^ * % ^\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as a list of lists in Python:\n\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    ['@', '*', '$', '&'],\n    ['^', '$', '&', '$'],\n    ['!', '$', '@', '$'],\n    ['^', '*', '%', '^']\n]\n```\n\nTo rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we will:\n1. Transpose the matrix.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['@', '*', '$', '&'],\n    ['^', '$', '&', '$'],\n    ['!', '$', '@', '$'],\n    ['^', '*', '%', '^']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix. Let's execute it to see the result."
