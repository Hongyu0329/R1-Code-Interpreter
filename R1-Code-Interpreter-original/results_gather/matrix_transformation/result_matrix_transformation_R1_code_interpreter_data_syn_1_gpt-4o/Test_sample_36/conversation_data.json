    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n8 9 1\n3 8 3\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D list:\n```\n[\n    ['8', '9', '1'],\n    ['3', '8', '3']\n]\n```\n\nTo rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['8', '9', '1'],\n    ['3', '8', '3']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened form, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix in a flattened form. Now, let's format the output as requested. The output list `['3', '8', '8', '9', '3', '1']` represents the rotated matrix:\n\n```\n3 8\n8 9\n3 1\n```\n\nIn the required format, this would be represented as <<<3,8,8,9,3,1>>>.\n\n<<<3,8,8,9,3,1>>>"
