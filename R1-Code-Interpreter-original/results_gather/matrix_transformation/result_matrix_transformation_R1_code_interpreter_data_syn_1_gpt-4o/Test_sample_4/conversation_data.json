    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nZ T\nO H\n```\n\nThe matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['Z', 'T'],\n  ['O', 'H']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nFor the given matrix:\n- The first column `['Z', 'O']` becomes the first row `['O', 'Z']` in the rotated matrix.\n- The second column `['T', 'H']` becomes the second row `['H', 'T']` in the rotated matrix.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix should look like:\n```\n[\n  ['O', 'Z'],\n  ['H', 'T']\n]\n```\n\nTo implement this transformation, we can use Python to manipulate the matrix. Let's write a script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n    return [list(reversed(col)) for col in zip(*matrix)]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'T'],\n    ['O', 'H']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a list of values and symbols\nformatted_output = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and format the output as a single string with values separated by commas. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `O,Z,H,T`, which represents the rotated matrix. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nZ T\nO H\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nO Z\nH T\n```\n\nThis matches the output `O,Z,H,T`, formatted as a single string with values separated by commas.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<O,Z,H,T>>>"
