    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nG 6 B H\nK Q 3 7\n7 2 H 4\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n2. The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n3. This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nFor a 3x4 matrix, the rotated matrix will be a 4x3 matrix. Let's write a Python script to perform this transformation.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', '6', 'B', 'H'],\n    ['K', 'Q', '3', '7'],\n    ['7', '2', 'H', '4']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with swapped dimensions\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[c][rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix as a flattened list. Now, let's format the result according to the specified format.\n\nThe output list `['7', 'K', 'G', '2', 'Q', '6', 'H', '3', 'B', '4', '7', 'H']` represents the rotated matrix:\n\n```\n7 K G\n2 Q 6\nH 3 B\n4 7 H\n```\n\nTo match the required format, we will represent this as a single string with elements separated by commas.\n\n<<<7,K,G,2,Q,6,H,3,B,4,7,H>>>"
