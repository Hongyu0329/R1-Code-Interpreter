    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n4 2 7\n7 8 6\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows into columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  4 2 7\n  7 8 6\n  ```\n\n- Transpose the matrix:\n  ```\n  4 7\n  2 8\n  7 6\n  ```\n\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix:\n  ```\n  7 4\n  8 2\n  6 7\n  ```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to ensure the correctness of the solution.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 2, 7],\n    [7, 8, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix. The matrix after rotating 90 degrees clockwise is:\n\n```\n7 4\n8 2\n6 7\n```\n\nThis matches our expected result. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7,4,8,2,6,7>>>"
