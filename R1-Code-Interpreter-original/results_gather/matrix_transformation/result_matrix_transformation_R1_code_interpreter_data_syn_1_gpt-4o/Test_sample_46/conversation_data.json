    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The original matrix is:\n\n```\nN U L\nM C A\nQ S T\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows into columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  [\n    ['N', 'U', 'L'],\n    ['M', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['Q', 'S', 'T']\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Transpose the matrix:\n  ```\n  [\n    ['N', 'M', 'Q'],\n    ['U', 'C', 'S'],\n    ['L', 'A', 'T']\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix:\n  ```\n  [\n    ['Q', 'M', 'N'],\n    ['S', 'C', 'U'],\n    ['T', 'A', 'L']\n  ]\n  ```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'U', 'L'],\n    ['M', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['Q', 'S', 'T']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix:\n\n```\n[['Q', 'M', 'N'], ['S', 'C', 'U'], ['T', 'A', 'L']]\n```\n\nThis represents the matrix after rotating 90 degrees clockwise. Now, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<Q,M,N,S,C,U,T,A,L>>>"
