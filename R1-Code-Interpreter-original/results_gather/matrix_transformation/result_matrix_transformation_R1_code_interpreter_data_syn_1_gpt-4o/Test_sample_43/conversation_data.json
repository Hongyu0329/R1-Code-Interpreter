    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nZ D O\nK Q S\nR U P\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row, first column (0,0) will move to the first row, last column (0,2).\n- The element at the first row, second column (0,1) will move to the second row, last column (1,2).\n- The element at the first row, third column (0,2) will move to the third row, last column (2,2).\n- Similarly, the element at the second row, first column (1,0) will move to the first row, second column (0,1), and so on.\n\nThe general rule for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise is:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'D', 'O'],\n    ['K', 'Q', 'S'],\n    ['R', 'U', 'P']\n]\n\n# Number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix)\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Apply the rotation transformation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result according to the specified format.\n\nThe output of the code is a flattened list of the rotated matrix: `['R', 'K', 'Z', 'U', 'Q', 'D', 'P', 'S', 'O']`.\n\nTo match the required format, we need to convert this list into a string with elements separated by commas and enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<R,K,Z,U,Q,D,P,S,O>>>"
