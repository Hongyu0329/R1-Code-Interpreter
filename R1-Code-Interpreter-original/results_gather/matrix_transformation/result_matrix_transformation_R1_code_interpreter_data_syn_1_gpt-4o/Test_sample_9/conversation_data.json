    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nS V\nU O\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the rotated matrix.\n- The second column of the original matrix becomes the second row of the rotated matrix.\n\nFor the given matrix:\n```\nOriginal:\nS V\nU O\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\nU S\nO V\n```\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the following steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\noriginal_matrix = [\n    [\"S\", \"V\"],\n    [\"U\", \"O\"]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*original_matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the expected output. The rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n[['U', 'S'], ['O', 'V']]\n```\n\nThis matches our manual calculation of the 90-degree clockwise rotation of the original matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<U,S,O,V>>>"
