    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise. The original matrix is:\n\n```\n[\n    ['&', '!', '$', '*'],\n    ['%', '%', '@', '#'],\n    ['$', '#', '!', '*'],\n    ['&', '&', '#', '&']\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nTo achieve this, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['&', '!', '$', '*'],\n    ['%', '%', '@', '#'],\n    ['$', '#', '!', '*'],\n    ['&', '&', '#', '&']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, resulting in the following:\n\n```\n[\n    ['&', '$', '%', '&'],\n    ['&', '#', '%', '!'],\n    ['#', '!', '@', '$'],\n    ['&', '*', '#', '*']\n]\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the original matrix. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<&,$,%,&,&,#,%!,#,!,@,$,&,*,#,*>>>"
