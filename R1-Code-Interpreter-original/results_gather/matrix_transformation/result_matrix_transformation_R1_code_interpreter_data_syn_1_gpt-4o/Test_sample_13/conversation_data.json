    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nH C\nR U\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the first column from the bottom to the top and making it the first row.\n2. Taking the second column from the bottom to the top and making it the second row.\n\nFor the given matrix:\n- The first column from bottom to top is `R, H`.\n- The second column from bottom to top is `U, C`.\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nR H\nU C\n```\n\nTo implement this transformation programmatically, we can use Python to manipulate the matrix. Let's write a Python script to perform this operation.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(matrix)\n    num_cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = []\n    \n    # Rotate the matrix\n    for col in range(num_cols):\n        new_row = []\n        for row in range(num_rows - 1, -1, -1):\n            new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n        rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"H\", \"C\"],\n    [\"R\", \"U\"]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a list of values and symbols\noutput = []\nfor row in rotated_matrix:\n    output.extend(row)\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix as a flat list. Now, let's format the output according to the specified format, which is a list of values and symbols separated by commas and enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nThe output from the code is `['R', 'H', 'U', 'C']`, which corresponds to the rotated matrix:\n```\nR H\nU C\n```\n\nTherefore, the final formatted answer is:\n\n<<<R,H,U,C>>>"
