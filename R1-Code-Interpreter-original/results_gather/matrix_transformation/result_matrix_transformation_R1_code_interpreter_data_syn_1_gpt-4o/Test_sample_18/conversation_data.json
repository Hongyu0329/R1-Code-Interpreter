    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nC Z\nI U\n```\n\nThe matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['C', 'Z'],\n  ['I', 'U']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to (1,0).\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['C', 'Z'],\n    ['I', 'U']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[c][rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of strings\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list of strings. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix as a flattened list: `['I', 'C', 'U', 'Z']`. This represents the matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nC Z\nI U\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nI C\nU Z\n```\n\nFlattened, this is represented as `['I', 'C', 'U', 'Z']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<I,C,U,Z>>>"
