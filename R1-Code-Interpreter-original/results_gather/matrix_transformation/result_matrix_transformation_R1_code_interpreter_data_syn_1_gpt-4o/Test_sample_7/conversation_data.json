    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nZ C\nR U\n```\n\nThe matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['Z', 'C'],\n  ['R', 'U']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nFor a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to (1,0).\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(matrix)\n    num_cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(num_rows)] for _ in range(num_cols)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        for j in range(num_cols):\n            rotated_matrix[j][num_rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'C'],\n    ['R', 'U']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix in the desired format\nresult = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result in the specified format. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is as expected. The matrix:\n\n```\nZ C\nR U\n```\n\nwhen rotated 90 degrees clockwise, becomes:\n\n```\nR Z\nU C\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the output format:\n\n<<<R,Z,U,C>>>\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<R,Z,U,C>>>"
