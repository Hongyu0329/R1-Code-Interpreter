    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n4 2 9\n9 4 7\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D list:\n```\n[\n    ['4', '2', '9'],\n    ['9', '4', '7']\n]\n```\n\nTo rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['4', '2', '9'],\n    ['9', '4', '7']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened form, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the flattened version of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output as requested.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n4 2 9\n9 4 7\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n9 4\n4 2\n7 9\n```\n\nThe flattened version of this matrix is `['9', '4', '4', '2', '7', '9']`.\n\nNow, let's format this output as a string with commas separating the elements.\n\n<<<9,4,4,2,7,9>>>"
