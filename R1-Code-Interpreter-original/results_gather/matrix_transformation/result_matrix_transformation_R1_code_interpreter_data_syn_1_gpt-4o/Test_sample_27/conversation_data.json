    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given matrix element at position (i, j), after a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it will move to the position (j, n-1-i), where n is the number of rows in the matrix. This transformation effectively rotates the matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Determine the dimensions of the matrix.\n2. Create a new matrix to store the rotated result.\n3. Iterate over each element of the original matrix and place it in the new position in the rotated matrix.\n4. Print the rotated matrix in the specified format.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n1 4 3\n6 8 7\n```\n\nWe will apply the above logic to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"1\", \"4\", \"3\"],\n    [\"6\", \"8\", \"7\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[\"\" for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix and format the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\nprint(f\"<<<{','.join(flattened_result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in the specified format.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix in the specified format. The original matrix:\n\n```\n1 4 3\n6 8 7\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, becomes:\n\n```\n6 1\n8 4\n7 3\n```\n\nFlattened, this results in the sequence: `6, 1, 8, 4, 7, 3`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6,1,8,4,7,3>>>"
