    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nR N\nC P\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the rotated matrix, but in reverse order.\n- The second column of the original matrix becomes the second row of the rotated matrix, also in reverse order.\n\nFor the given matrix:\n- The first column is `R, C`, which becomes the first row of the rotated matrix as `C, R`.\n- The second column is `N, P`, which becomes the second row of the rotated matrix as `P, N`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix should look like:\n```\nC R\nP N\n```\n\nTo implement this, we can write a Python script to perform the rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n    return [list(reversed(col)) for col in zip(*matrix)]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['R', 'N'],\n    ['C', 'P']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a list of values and symbols\noutput = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result in the required format. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `['C', 'R', 'P', 'N']`, which represents the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. \n\nNow, let's format the final answer according to the specified format:\n\n<<<C,R,P,N>>>"
