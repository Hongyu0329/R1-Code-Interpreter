    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [A, B, C],\n  [D, E, F],\n  [G, H, I]\n]\n```\n\nRotating it 90 degrees clockwise results in:\n```\n[\n  [G, D, A],\n  [H, E, B],\n  [I, F, C]\n]\n```\n\nThe transformation rule for a matrix element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix to its new position in the rotated matrix is:\n- The element at `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to `(j, n-1-i)` in the rotated matrix, where `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n```\n[\n  ['*', '&', '&', '@'],\n  ['&', '%', '*', '!'],\n  ['!', '*', '%', '^'],\n  ['^', '@', '%', '$']\n]\n```\n\nWe will write a Python script to perform this rotation and output the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['*', '&', '&', '@'],\n    ['&', '%', '*', '!'],\n    ['!', '*', '%', '^'],\n    ['^', '@', '%', '$']\n]\n\n# Get the number of rows (n) and columns (m)\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions m x n\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result as requested.\n\nThe output of the code is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. To match the required format, we need to present this list as a comma-separated string enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n  ['^', '!', '&', '*'],\n  ['@', '*', '%', '&'],\n  ['%', '%', '*', '&'],\n  ['$', '^', '!', '@']\n]\n```\n\nFlattened, it becomes:\n`['^', '!', '&', '*', '@', '*', '%', '&', '%', '%', '*', '&', '$', '^', '!', '@']`\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<^,!,&,*,@,*,%,&,%,%,*,&,$,^,!,@>>>"
