    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nL G J M\nB I F K\nF 7 R 3\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n- The third row of the original matrix becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n\nThe transformation can be achieved by:\n1. Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"L\", \"G\", \"J\", \"M\"],\n    [\"B\", \"I\", \"F\", \"K\"],\n    [\"F\", \"7\", \"R\", \"3\"]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the flattened version of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result as requested.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nF B L\n7 I G\nR F J\n3 K M\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix row by row gives us the list: `['F', 'B', 'L', '7', 'I', 'G', 'R', 'F', 'J', '3', 'K', 'M']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<F,B,L,7,I,G,R,F,J,3,K,M>>>"
