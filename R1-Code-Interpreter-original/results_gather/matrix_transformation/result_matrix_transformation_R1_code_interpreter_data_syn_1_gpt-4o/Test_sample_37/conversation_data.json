    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, after a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it will be positioned at (j, n-1-i) in the new matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n6 9 6\n4 7 2\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D array:\n```\n[\n    ['6', '9', '6'],\n    ['4', '7', '2']\n]\n```\n\nThe dimensions of this matrix are 2 rows by 3 columns. After rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix will have 3 rows and 2 columns.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['6', '9', '6'],\n    ['4', '7', '2']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the flattened list representation of the rotated matrix. The original matrix:\n\n```\n6 9 6\n4 7 2\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, becomes:\n\n```\n4 6\n7 9\n2 6\n```\n\nThis is represented as a flattened list: `['4', '6', '7', '9', '2', '6']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4,6,7,9,2,6>>>"
