    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    [\"6\", \"P\", \"T\", \"D\"],\n    [\"7\", \"L\", \"L\", \"4\"],\n    [\"P\", \"C\", \"O\", \"S\"]\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"6\", \"P\", \"T\", \"D\"],\n    [\"7\", \"L\", \"L\", \"4\"],\n    [\"P\", \"C\", \"O\", \"S\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor j in range(m):\n    new_row = []\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[i][j])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix as a flattened list. Now, let's interpret this result and format it according to the required output format.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    [\"P\", \"7\", \"6\"],\n    [\"C\", \"L\", \"P\"],\n    [\"O\", \"L\", \"T\"],\n    [\"S\", \"4\", \"D\"]\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix row by row gives us the list: `['P', '7', '6', 'C', 'L', 'P', 'O', 'L', 'T', 'S', '4', 'D']`.\n\nNow, let's format this result as requested:\n\n<<<P,7,6,C,L,P,O,L,T,S,4,D>>>"
