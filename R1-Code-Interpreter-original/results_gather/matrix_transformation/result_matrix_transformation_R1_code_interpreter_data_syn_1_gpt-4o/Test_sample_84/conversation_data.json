    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n2. Reversing the order of elements in each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- Given a matrix with dimensions `m x n`, the rotated matrix will have dimensions `n x m`.\n- The element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix will move to position `(j, m-1-i)` in the rotated matrix.\n\nLet's apply this logic to the given matrix:\n```\n^ % ^ #\n@ ! $ !\n^ ^ @ !\n% @ ^ $\n```\n\nWe will write a Python script to perform this rotation and output the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['^', '%', '^', '#'],\n    ['@', '!', '$', '!'],\n    ['^', '^', '@', '!'],\n    ['%', '@', '^', '$']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nm = len(matrix)\nn = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions n x m\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][m - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result according to the specified format.\n\nThe output from the code is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. To match the required format, we need to represent this list as a 2D array in a single line, separated by commas.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['%', '^', '@', '^'],\n    ['@', '^', '!', '%'],\n    ['^', '@', '$', '^'],\n    ['$', '!', '!', '#']\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix gives us the list: `['%', '^', '@', '^', '@', '^', '!', '%', '^', '@', '$', '^', '$', '!', '!', '#']`.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<%,^,@,^,@,^,!,%,^,@,$,^,$,!,!,#>>>"
