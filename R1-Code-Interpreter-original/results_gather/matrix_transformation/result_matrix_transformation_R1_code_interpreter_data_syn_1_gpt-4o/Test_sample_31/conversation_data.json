    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n7 4 6\n6 9 4\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: This means converting all rows to columns and vice versa.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  7 4 6\n  6 9 4\n  ```\n\n- Transpose the matrix:\n  ```\n  7 6\n  4 9\n  6 4\n  ```\n\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix:\n  ```\n  6 7\n  9 4\n  4 6\n  ```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to ensure the correctness of our approach.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"7\", \"4\", \"6\"],\n    [\"6\", \"9\", \"4\"]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix in a flattened form. The matrix after rotating 90 degrees clockwise is:\n\n```\n6 7\n9 4\n4 6\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix gives us the list: `['6', '7', '9', '4', '4', '6']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6,7,9,4,4,6>>>"
