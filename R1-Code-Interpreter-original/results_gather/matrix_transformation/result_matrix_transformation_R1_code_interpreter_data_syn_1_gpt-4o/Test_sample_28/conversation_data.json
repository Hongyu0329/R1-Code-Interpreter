    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n6 2 8\n2 9 7\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows into columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  [\n    [6, 2, 8],\n    [2, 9, 7]\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Transpose the matrix:\n  ```\n  [\n    [6, 2],\n    [2, 9],\n    [8, 7]\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix:\n  ```\n  [\n    [8, 2],\n    [7, 9],\n    [6, 2]\n  ]\n  ```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to ensure the steps are correctly followed and to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 2, 8],\n    [2, 9, 7]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, resulting in:\n\n```\n[\n  [2, 6],\n  [9, 2],\n  [7, 8]\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>. Each row of the matrix will be represented as a list of values separated by commas.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2,6,9,2,7,8>>>"
