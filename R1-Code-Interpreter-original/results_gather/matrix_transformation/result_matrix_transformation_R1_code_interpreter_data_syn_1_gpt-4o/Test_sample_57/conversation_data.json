    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nL A D\nR P Z\nH D Y\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"L\", \"A\", \"D\"],\n    [\"R\", \"P\", \"Z\"],\n    [\"H\", \"D\", \"Y\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows in the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with empty strings\nrotated_matrix = [[\"\" for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix according to the transformation rule\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_rotated_matrix = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened form, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix in a flattened form. Now, let's format the output as requested.\n\nThe output list `['H', 'R', 'L', 'D', 'P', 'A', 'Y', 'Z', 'D']` represents the rotated matrix:\n```\nH R L\nD P A\nY Z D\n```\n\nTo match the required format, we will represent this as a single string with elements separated by commas.\n\n<<<H,R,L,D,P,A,Y,Z,D>>>"
