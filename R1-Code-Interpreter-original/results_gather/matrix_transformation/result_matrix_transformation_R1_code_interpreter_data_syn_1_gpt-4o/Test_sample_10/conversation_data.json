    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nM X\nB U\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 matrix. When we rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nFor a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to position (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to position (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to position (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to position (1,0).\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"M\", \"X\"],\n    [\"B\", \"U\"]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[None] * rows for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[c][rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `['B', 'M', 'U', 'X']`. This represents the rotated matrix in a flattened form. \n\nTo interpret this result:\n- The first row of the rotated matrix is `['B', 'M']`.\n- The second row of the rotated matrix is `['U', 'X']`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\nB M\nU X\n```\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<B,M,U,X>>>"
