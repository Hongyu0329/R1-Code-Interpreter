    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n5 2 6\n8 6 8\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: This means converting all rows to columns and vice versa.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  [\n    [5, 2, 6],\n    [8, 6, 8]\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Transpose the matrix:\n  ```\n  [\n    [5, 8],\n    [2, 6],\n    [6, 8]\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the final rotated matrix:\n  ```\n  [\n    [8, 5],\n    [6, 2],\n    [8, 6]\n  ]\n  ```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 2, 6],\n    [8, 6, 8]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix as a flattened list. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result is:\n\n```\n[\n  [8, 5],\n  [6, 2],\n  [8, 6]\n]\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes: `[8, 5, 6, 2, 8, 6]`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8,5,6,2,8,6>>>"
