    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix:\n```\na b c\nd e f\ng h i\n```\n\nRotating it 90 degrees clockwise results in:\n```\ng d a\nh e b\ni f c\n```\n\nThe transformation can be described as follows:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n8 3 2\n6 3 1\n```\n\nWe can apply the same transformation:\n- The first row `[8, 3, 2]` becomes the last column `[2, 3, 8]`.\n- The second row `[6, 3, 1]` becomes the second-to-last column `[1, 3, 6]`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(matrix)\n    num_cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * num_rows for _ in range(num_cols)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for r in range(num_rows):\n        for c in range(num_cols):\n            rotated_matrix[c][num_rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 3, 2],\n    [6, 3, 1]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the rotated matrix. The result of rotating the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise is:\n\n```\n6 8\n3 3\n1 2\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation where:\n- The first row `[8, 3, 2]` becomes the last column `[2, 3, 8]`.\n- The second row `[6, 3, 1]` becomes the second-to-last column `[1, 3, 6]`.\n\nThus, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<6,8,3,3,1,2>>>"
