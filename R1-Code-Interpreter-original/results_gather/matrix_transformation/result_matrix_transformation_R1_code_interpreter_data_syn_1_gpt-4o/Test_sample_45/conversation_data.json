    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given matrix element at position (i, j), after a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it will move to the position (j, n-1-i), where n is the number of rows in the matrix. This transformation effectively swaps the rows and columns and reverses the order of the rows.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Determine the dimensions of the matrix.\n2. Create a new matrix to hold the rotated values.\n3. Iterate over each element in the original matrix and place it in the new position in the rotated matrix.\n4. Print the rotated matrix in the specified format.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nF K I\nF Q Y\nC I E\n```\n\nWe will apply the above steps to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['F', 'K', 'I'],\n    ['F', 'Q', 'Y'],\n    ['C', 'I', 'E']\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix and format the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the flattened version of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result according to the specified format.\n\nThe output list `['C', 'F', 'F', 'I', 'Q', 'K', 'E', 'Y', 'I']` represents the rotated matrix:\n```\nC F F\nI Q K\nE Y I\n```\n\nTo match the required format, we need to convert this list into a string with elements separated by commas.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<C,F,F,I,Q,K,E,Y,I>>>"
