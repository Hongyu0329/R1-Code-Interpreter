    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n4 1 3\n4 7 1\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise are:\n1. The first row `[4, 1, 3]` becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n2. The second row `[4, 7, 1]` becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the rotated matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"4\", \"1\", \"3\"],\n    [\"4\", \"7\", \"1\"]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a list of values and symbols\nformatted_output = \",\".join([\",\".join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and format the output as requested. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `4,4,7,1,1,3`. This represents the rotated matrix in a single line, where each element is separated by a comma.\n\nTo interpret this output as a 2D matrix:\n- The first column of the rotated matrix is `4, 4`.\n- The second column of the rotated matrix is `7, 1`.\n- The third column of the rotated matrix is `1, 3`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix is:\n```\n4 4\n7 1\n1 3\n```\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<4,4,7,1,1,3>>>"
