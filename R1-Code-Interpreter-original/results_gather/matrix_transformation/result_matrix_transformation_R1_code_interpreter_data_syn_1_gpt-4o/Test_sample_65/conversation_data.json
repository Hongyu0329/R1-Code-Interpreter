    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nK P E 3\nY 2 P S\nL J U 3\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D list in Python:\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    ['K', 'P', 'E', '3'],\n    ['Y', '2', 'P', 'S'],\n    ['L', 'J', 'U', '3']\n]\n```\n\nThe rotated matrix will have:\n- The first row `['K', 'P', 'E', '3']` become the last column `['L', 'Y', 'K']`.\n- The second row `['Y', '2', 'P', 'S']` become the second last column `['J', '2', 'P']`.\n- The third row `['L', 'J', 'U', '3']` become the first column `['3', 'S', '3']`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['K', 'P', 'E', '3'],\n    ['Y', '2', 'P', 'S'],\n    ['L', 'J', 'U', '3']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows-1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a 2D array of strings, which represents a letter matrix.
