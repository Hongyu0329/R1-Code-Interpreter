    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The original matrix is:\n\n```\nR 7 I S\nS K C A\n1 1 S E\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix: This means converting rows into columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The original matrix is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows and 4 columns).\n- After transposing, it will become a 4x3 matrix.\n- Then, reversing each row of the transposed matrix will give us the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['R', '7', 'I', 'S'],\n    ['S', 'K', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['1', '1', 'S', 'E']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Now, let's interpret this result to provide the final answer in the required format.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n1 S R\n1 K 7\nS C I\nE A S\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes: `['1', 'S', 'R', '1', 'K', '7', 'S', 'C', 'I', 'E', 'A', 'S']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1,S,R,1,K,7,S,C,I,E,A,S>>>"
