    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix is represented as a list of strings, where each string is a row in the matrix. \n\nThe original matrix is:\n```\n[\n    \"^ ^ @\",\n    \"@ % @ &\",\n    \"% * ^ %\",\n    \"! ! ! *\"\n]\n```\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix as a list of strings\nmatrix = [\n    \"^ ^ @\",\n    \"@ % @ &\",\n    \"% * ^ %\",\n    \"! ! ! *\"\n]\n\n# Split each string into a list of characters\nmatrix = [row.split() for row in matrix]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix into a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the flattened list of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the final answer according to the specified format.\n\nThe rotated matrix, when flattened, is:\n```\n['!', '%', '@', '^', '!', '*', '%', '^', '!', '^', '@', '@']\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<!,%,@,^,!,*,%,^,!,^,@,@>>>"
