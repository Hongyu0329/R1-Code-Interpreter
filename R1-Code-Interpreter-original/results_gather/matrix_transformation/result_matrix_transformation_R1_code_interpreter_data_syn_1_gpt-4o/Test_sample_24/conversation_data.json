    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n7 1 2\n7 8 9\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n    ['7', '1', '2'],\n    ['7', '8', '9']\n]\n```\n\nWhen rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix should be:\n```\n[\n    ['7', '7'],\n    ['8', '1'],\n    ['9', '2']\n]\n```\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a simple algorithm:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify the result:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['7', '1', '2'],\n    ['7', '8', '9']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a list of strings\nformatted_output = [','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result in the specified format. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the expected output. The rotated matrix is represented as a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a row in the rotated matrix. \n\nThe output `['7,7', '8,1', '9,2']` indicates that the matrix has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise correctly.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<7,7,8,1,9,2>>>"
