    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise. Let's break down the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix. Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows into columns.\n\n2. **Rotation Logic**: \n   - The first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix.\n   - The second row of the new matrix will be the second last column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\n3. **Implementation**: \n   - We can achieve this by iterating over the columns of the original matrix from the last to the first and collecting the elements in each column to form the rows of the new matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['#', '@', '!', '&'],\n    ['^', '@', '!', '#'],\n    ['^', '#', '*', '&'],\n    ['$', '*', '&', '%']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix as a flattened list. Now, let's interpret this result and format it according to the required output format.\n\nThe output list `['$', '^', '^', '#', '*', '#', '@', '@', '&', '*', '!', '!', '%', '&', '#', '&']` represents the rotated matrix. We need to format this into a 2D array representation.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n$\n^\n^\n#\n*\n#\n@\n@\n&\n*\n!\n!\n%\n&\n#\n&\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the following 2D array:\n```\n['$', '^', '^', '#'],\n['*', '#', '@', '@'],\n['&', '*', '!', '!'],\n['%', '&', '#', '&']\n```\n\nNow, let's format this into the required output format.\n\n<<<['$', '^', '^', '#'], ['*', '#', '@', '@'], ['&', '*', '!', '!'], ['%', '&', '#', '&']>>>"
