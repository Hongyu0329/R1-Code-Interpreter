    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nG Y Z\nA A A\nU B Y\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the first column from the bottom to the top and making it the first row.\n2. Taking the second column from the bottom to the top and making it the second row.\n3. Taking the third column from the bottom to the top and making it the third row.\n\nThe transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The first column `G, A, U` becomes the first row `U, A, G`.\n- The second column `Y, A, B` becomes the second row `B, A, Y`.\n- The third column `Z, A, Y` becomes the third row `Y, A, Z`.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nU A G\nB A Y\nY A Z\n```\n\nTo implement this, we can write a Python script to perform the rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n    return [list(reversed(col)) for col in zip(*matrix)]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'Y', 'Z'],\n    ['A', 'A', 'A'],\n    ['U', 'B', 'Y']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a single list of values\noutput = [item for row in rotated_matrix for item in row]\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result as a single list of values. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output as expected. The rotated matrix, when flattened into a single list, is `['U', 'A', 'G', 'B', 'A', 'Y', 'Y', 'A', 'Z']`.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer according to the specified format:\n\n<<<U,A,G,B,A,Y,Y,A,Z>>>"
