    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['&', '^', '!', '$'],\n    ['#', '&', '%', '!'],\n    ['#', '#', '&', '&'],\n    ['#', '%', '$', '!']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the new matrix will be the last column of the original matrix, the second row of the new matrix will be the second last column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\nTo achieve this, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['&', '^', '!', '$'],\n    ['#', '&', '%', '!'],\n    ['#', '#', '&', '&'],\n    ['#', '%', '$', '!']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list for the final output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output represents the 2D array rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output is a flattened list of the rotated matrix. \n\nTo provide the final answer in the required format, we need to convert this list into a string with elements separated by commas.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['#', '#', '#', '&'],\n    ['%', '#', '&', '^'],\n    ['$', '&', '%', '!'],\n    ['!', '&', '!', '$']\n]\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix gives us the list: `['#', '#', '#', '&', '%', '#', '&', '^', '$', '&', '%', '!', '!', '&', '!', '$']`.\n\nNow, let's format this list as a string with elements separated by commas.\n\n<<<#,#,#,&,%,#,&,^,$,&,%,!,!,&,!,$>>>"
