    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nWhen a matrix is rotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n^ & @ %\n* ! ! #\n! # * %\n* $ ^ @\n```\n\nWe can break down the steps to achieve the rotation:\n1. Determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, it's a 4x4 matrix.\n2. Create a new matrix with the dimensions swapped (i.e., the number of rows becomes the number of columns and vice versa).\n3. Populate the new matrix by taking elements from the original matrix in the order that achieves a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['^', '&', '@', '%'],\n    ['*', '!', '!', '#'],\n    ['!', '#', '*', '%'],\n    ['*', '$', '^', '@']\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Populate the rotated matrix\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[c][rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a flattened list representing the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result according to the specified format.\n\nThe output list `['*', '!', '*', '^', '$', '#', '!', '&', '^', '*', '!', '@', '@', '%', '#', '%']` represents the rotated matrix. We need to format it as a 2D array in the specified format.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n* ! * ^\n$ # ! &\n^ * ! @\n@ % # %\n```\n\nNow, let's format this as a list of values and symbols:\n\n<<<*,!,*,^,$,#,!,&,^,*,!,@,@,%,#,%,>>>"
