    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nE N\nY J\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, the second column becomes the second row in reverse order, and so on. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. The original matrix is:\n   ```\n   E N\n   Y J\n   ```\n\n2. After rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the first column `E Y` becomes the first row `Y E`, and the second column `N J` becomes the second row `J N`.\n\n3. The resulting matrix after the rotation is:\n   ```\n   Y E\n   J N\n   ```\n\nTo implement this transformation programmatically, we can use Python to manipulate the matrix. Let's write a Python script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"E\", \"N\"],\n    [\"Y\", \"J\"]\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of strings\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix as a flattened list. Now, let's format the final answer according to the specified format.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nY E\nJ N\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes `['Y', 'E', 'J', 'N']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Y,E,J,N>>>"
