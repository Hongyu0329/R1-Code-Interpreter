    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nT K M\nC M A\nX U I\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The third row of the original matrix becomes the first column of the rotated matrix.\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix, the transformation can be described as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,2).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,2).\n- The element at position (0,2) moves to (2,2).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to (0,1).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,2) moves to (2,1).\n- The element at position (2,0) moves to (0,0).\n- The element at position (2,1) moves to (1,0).\n- The element at position (2,2) moves to (2,0).\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'K', 'M'],\n    ['C', 'M', 'A'],\n    ['X', 'U', 'I']\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a flattened list representing the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output as requested.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nX C T\nU M K\nI A M\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix into a single list, we get: `['X', 'C', 'T', 'U', 'M', 'K', 'I', 'A', 'M']`.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<X,C,T,U,M,K,I,A,M>>>"
