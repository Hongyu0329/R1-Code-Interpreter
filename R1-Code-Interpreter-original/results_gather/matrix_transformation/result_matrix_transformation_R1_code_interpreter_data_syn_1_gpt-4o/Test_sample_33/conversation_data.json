    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n1 8 4\n7 4 1\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['1', '8', '4'],\n  ['7', '4', '1']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on. The transformation can be described as follows:\n\n- The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['1', '8', '4'],\n    ['7', '4', '1']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a flattened list representing the rotated matrix. The original matrix:\n\n```\n1 8 4\n7 4 1\n```\n\nWhen rotated 90 degrees clockwise, becomes:\n\n```\n7 1\n4 8\n1 4\n```\n\nFlattening this matrix results in the list: `['7', '1', '4', '8', '1', '4']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7,1,4,8,1,4>>>"
