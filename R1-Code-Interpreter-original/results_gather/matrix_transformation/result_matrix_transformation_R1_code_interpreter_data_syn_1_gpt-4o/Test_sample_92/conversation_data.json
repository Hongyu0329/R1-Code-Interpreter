    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list is a row of the matrix.\n\nThe original matrix is:\n```\n* # $ *\n% @ # @\n& * ^ %\n^ ! $ *\n```\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Convert rows to columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The first row `[* # $ *]` will become the last column.\n- The second row `[% @ # @]` will become the third column.\n- The third row `[& * ^ %]` will become the second column.\n- The fourth row `[^ ! $ *]` will become the first column.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['*', '#', '$', '*'],\n    ['%', '@', '#', '@'],\n    ['&', '*', '^', '%'],\n    ['^', '!', '$', '*']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(mat):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed = list(zip(*mat))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed]\n    return rotated\n\n# Get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result as requested.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n^ & % *\n! * @ #\n$ ^ # $\n* % @ *\n```\n\nTo represent this matrix in the required format, we will list the elements row by row, separated by commas.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<^,&,%,*,!,*,@,#,$,^,#,$,*,%,@,*>>>"
