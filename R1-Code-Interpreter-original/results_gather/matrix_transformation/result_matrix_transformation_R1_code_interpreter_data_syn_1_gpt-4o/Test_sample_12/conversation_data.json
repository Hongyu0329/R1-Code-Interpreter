    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nL U\nX K\n```\n\nThe matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['L', 'U'],\n  ['X', 'K']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. The transformation can be visualized as follows:\n\nOriginal:\n```\nL U\nX K\n```\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\nX L\nK U\n```\n\nThis means the new matrix will be:\n```\n[\n  ['X', 'L'],\n  ['K', 'U']\n]\n```\n\nTo achieve this programmatically, we can use the following approach:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed]\n    return rotated\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', 'U'],\n    ['X', 'K']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a list of values and symbols\nformatted_output = ','.join([','.join(row) for row in rotated_matrix])\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_output}>>>\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is as expected. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, resulting in the new arrangement of elements. \n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<X,L,K,U>>>"
