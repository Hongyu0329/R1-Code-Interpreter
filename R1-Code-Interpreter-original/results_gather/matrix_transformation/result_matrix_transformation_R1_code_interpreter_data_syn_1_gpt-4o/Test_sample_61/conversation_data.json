    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nG P 7 L\nI O E 1\n9 8 X X\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n2. The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n3. This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nFor a 3x4 matrix, the result of a 90-degree clockwise rotation will be a 4x3 matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The first column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the first row of the original matrix.\n- The second column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the second row of the original matrix.\n- The third column of the new matrix will be the reverse of the third row of the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'P', '7', 'L'],\n    ['I', 'O', 'E', '1'],\n    ['9', '8', 'X', 'X']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[c][rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for the output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. The output represents the 90-degree clockwise rotation of the original matrix.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nG P 7 L\nI O E 1\n9 8 X X\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n9 I G\n8 O P\nX E 7\nX 1 L\n```\n\nThe flattened list of this rotated matrix is:\n```\n['9', 'I', 'G', '8', 'O', 'P', 'X', 'E', '7', 'X', '1', 'L']\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<9,I,G,8,O,P,X,E,7,X,1,L>>>"
