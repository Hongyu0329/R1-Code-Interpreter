    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix.\n- This pattern continues for all rows.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n8 4 8\n4 5 4\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D list in Python:\n```\n[\n    ['8', '4', '8'],\n    ['4', '5', '4']\n]\n```\n\nTo rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['8', '4', '8'],\n    ['4', '5', '4']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list for the final output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix as a flattened list. Now, let's format the output according to the specified format, which is to return the result enclosed in `<<< >>>` with values separated by commas.\n\nThe output from the code is `['4', '8', '5', '4', '4', '8']`, which represents the rotated matrix. Therefore, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<4,8,5,4,4,8>>>"
