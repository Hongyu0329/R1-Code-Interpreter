    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nJ T\nU B\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on. \n\nFor a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to position (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to position (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to position (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to position (1,0).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['J', 'T'],\n    ['U', 'B']\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Fill the rotated matrix\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[c][rows - 1 - r] = matrix[r][c]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a list of values\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `['U', 'J', 'B', 'T']`. This represents the matrix after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\nJ T\nU B\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\nU J\nB T\n```\n\nThe flattened version of this rotated matrix is `['U', 'J', 'B', 'T']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<U,J,B,T>>>"
