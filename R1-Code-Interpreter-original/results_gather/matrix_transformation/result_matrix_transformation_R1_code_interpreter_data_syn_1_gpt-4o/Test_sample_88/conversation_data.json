    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nWhen a matrix is rotated 90 degrees clockwise:\n- The first row becomes the last column.\n- The second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n$ & ! &\n* @ % ^\n& * @ *\n^ * & !\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D list in Python:\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    [\"$\", \"&\", \"!\", \"&\"],\n    [\"*\", \"@\", \"%\", \"^\"],\n    [\"&\", \"*\", \"@\", \"*\"],\n    [\"^\", \"*\", \"&\", \"!\"]\n]\n```\n\nTo rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"$\", \"&\", \"!\", \"&\"],\n    [\"*\", \"@\", \"%\", \"^\"],\n    [\"&\", \"*\", \"@\", \"*\"],\n    [\"^\", \"*\", \"&\", \"!\"]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to get the rotated matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to match the required output format\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened format, which we can then format as requested."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a 2D array of strings, which represents a letter matrix.
