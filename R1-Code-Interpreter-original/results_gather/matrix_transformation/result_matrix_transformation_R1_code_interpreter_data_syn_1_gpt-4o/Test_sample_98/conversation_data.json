    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list is a row of the matrix. \n\nThe process of rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix: This means converting rows into columns.\n2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  [\n    ['^', '$', '$', '*'],\n    ['#', '^', '$', '@'],\n    ['%', '&', '@', '&'],\n    ['#', '&', '#', '@']\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Transpose the matrix:\n  - The first row of the transposed matrix will be the first column of the original matrix.\n  - The second row of the transposed matrix will be the second column of the original matrix, and so on.\n\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['^', '$', '$', '*'],\n    ['#', '^', '$', '@'],\n    ['%', '&', '@', '&'],\n    ['#', '&', '#', '@']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output as requested. The rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n[\n  ['#', '%', '#', '^'],\n  ['&', '&', '^', '$'],\n  ['#', '@', '$', '$'],\n  ['@', '&', '@', '*']\n]\n```\n\nTo format this as a single list of values and symbols, we will flatten the matrix and join the elements with commas. Here's the formatted output:\n\n<<<#,%,#,^,&,&,^,$,#,@,$,$,@,&,@,*>>>"
