    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during such a rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n1. Transposing the matrix, which means converting rows into columns.\n2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps for the given matrix:\n```\n[\n    ['*', '%', '%', '^'],\n    ['&', '%', '@', '@'],\n    ['^', '&', '!', '@'],\n    ['@', '$', '!', '!']\n]\n```\n\n1. **Transpose the matrix**: This involves swapping rows with columns.\n   - The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.\n\n2. **Reverse each row of the transposed matrix**: This will give us the final rotated matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['*', '%', '%', '^'],\n    ['&', '%', '@', '@'],\n    ['^', '&', '!', '@'],\n    ['@', '$', '!', '!']\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we can then format as requested.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output as requested, using the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[\n    ['@', '^', '&', '*'],\n    ['$', '&', '%', '%'],\n    ['!', '!', '@', '%'],\n    ['!', '@', '@', '^']\n]\n```\n\nTo format this as a single list of values and symbols, we will flatten the matrix and join the elements with commas.\n\n<<<@,^,&,*, $,&,%,%, !,!,@,%, !,@,@,^>>>"
