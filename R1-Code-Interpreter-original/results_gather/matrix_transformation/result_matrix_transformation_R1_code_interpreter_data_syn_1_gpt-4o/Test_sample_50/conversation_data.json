    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nM G K\nN H H\nE I Z\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the first column from the bottom to the top and making it the first row.\n2. Taking the second column from the bottom to the top and making it the second row.\n3. Taking the third column from the bottom to the top and making it the third row.\n\nThe transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The first column `E, N, M` becomes the first row.\n- The second column `I, H, G` becomes the second row.\n- The third column `Z, H, K` becomes the third row.\n\nThus, the rotated matrix will be:\n```\nE N M\nI H G\nZ H K\n```\n\nTo implement this transformation programmatically, we can use Python to manipulate the matrix. Let's write a script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [\"M\", \"G\", \"K\"],\n    [\"N\", \"H\", \"H\"],\n    [\"E\", \"I\", \"Z\"]\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = []\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nfor col in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for row in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n        new_row.append(matrix[row][col])\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix in a flattened list format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output as a flattened list of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output according to the specified format, which is a comma-separated list enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nThe rotated matrix in a 2D format is:\n```\nE N M\nI H G\nZ H K\n```\n\nFlattened, it becomes: `['E', 'N', 'M', 'I', 'H', 'G', 'Z', 'H', 'K']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<E,N,M,I,H,G,Z,H,K>>>"
