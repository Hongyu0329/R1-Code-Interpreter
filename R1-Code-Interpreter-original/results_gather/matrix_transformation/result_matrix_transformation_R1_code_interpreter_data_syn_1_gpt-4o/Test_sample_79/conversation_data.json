    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the elements in the matrix. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\n[\n  [X, 5, X, H],\n  [1, 9, W, K],\n  [4, Q, K, L]\n]\n```\n\nThe transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is as follows:\n- The element at the first row and first column (0,0) will move to the first column and last row (0,2).\n- The element at the first row and second column (0,1) will move to the second column and last row (1,2).\n- The element at the first row and third column (0,2) will move to the third column and last row (2,2).\n- The element at the first row and fourth column (0,3) will move to the fourth column and last row (3,2).\n\nIn general, for an element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the number of rows in the original matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['X', '5', 'X', 'H'],\n    ['1', '9', 'W', 'K'],\n    ['4', 'Q', 'K', 'L']\n]\n\n# Number of rows and columns in the original matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions cols x rows\nrotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        rotated_matrix[j][rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix for output\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and output the result as a flattened list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a flattened list representing the rotated matrix. Now, let's interpret this result into the required format.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n[\n  [X, 5, X, H],\n  [1, 9, W, K],\n  [4, Q, K, L]\n]\n```\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n[\n  [4, 1, X],\n  [Q, 9, 5],\n  [K, W, X],\n  [L, K, H]\n]\n```\n\nThe flattened list output from the code is:\n```\n['4', '1', 'X', 'Q', '9', '5', 'K', 'W', 'X', 'L', 'K', 'H']\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation. Now, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<4,1,X,Q,9,5,K,W,X,L,K,H>>>"
