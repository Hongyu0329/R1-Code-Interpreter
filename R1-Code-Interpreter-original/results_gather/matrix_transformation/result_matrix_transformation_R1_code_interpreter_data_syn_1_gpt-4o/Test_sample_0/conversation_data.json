    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nQ R\nJ H\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n```\n[\n  ['Q', 'R'],\n  ['J', 'H']\n]\n```\n\nWhen we rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first column becomes the first row in reverse order, and the second column becomes the second row in reverse order. The transformation can be described as follows:\n\n- The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,1).\n- The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,1).\n- The element at position (1,0) moves to (0,0).\n- The element at position (1,1) moves to (1,0).\n\nThe resulting matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation will be:\n```\n[\n  ['J', 'Q'],\n  ['H', 'R']\n]\n```\n\nTo implement this transformation, we can use Python code to perform the rotation. Let's write the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(matrix)\n    num_cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Create a new matrix for the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [['' for _ in range(num_rows)] for _ in range(num_cols)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        for j in range(num_cols):\n            rotated_matrix[j][num_rows - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'R'],\n    ['J', 'H']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the expected output. The rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n[['J', 'Q'], ['H', 'R']]\n```\n\nThis matches the expected result of rotating the original matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<J,Q,H,R>>>"
