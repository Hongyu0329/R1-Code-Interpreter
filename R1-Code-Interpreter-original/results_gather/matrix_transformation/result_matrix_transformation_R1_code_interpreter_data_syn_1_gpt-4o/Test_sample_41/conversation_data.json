    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nFor a given matrix, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second last column of the rotated matrix, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\nC T K\nY H F\nO N O\n```\n\nThe transformation will be:\n- The first row `C T K` becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n- The second row `Y H F` becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n- The third row `O N O` becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the rotated matrix\n    rotated = [list(reversed(row)) for row in transposed]\n    return rotated\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['C', 'T', 'K'],\n    ['Y', 'H', 'F'],\n    ['O', 'N', 'O']\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format the output as a single list of values\noutput = []\nfor row in rotated_matrix:\n    output.extend(row)\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise and print the result as a single list of values. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the result according to the specified format.\n\nThe output list `['O', 'Y', 'C', 'N', 'H', 'T', 'O', 'F', 'K']` represents the rotated matrix. We need to format it as a string with values separated by commas and enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nO Y C\nN H T\nO F K\n```\n\nSo, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<O,Y,C,N,H,T,O,F,K>>>"
