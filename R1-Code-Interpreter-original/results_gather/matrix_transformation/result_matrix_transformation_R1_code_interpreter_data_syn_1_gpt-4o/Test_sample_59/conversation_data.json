    "To solve the problem of rotating a 2D array of strings 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. \n\nGiven a matrix:\n```\nZ P E\nZ T V\nG I V\n```\n\nThe rotation process involves:\n1. Taking the first column from the bottom to the top and making it the first row.\n2. Taking the second column from the bottom to the top and making it the second row.\n3. Taking the third column from the bottom to the top and making it the third row.\n\nThe transformation can be visualized as follows:\n- The first column `['Z', 'Z', 'G']` becomes the first row `['G', 'Z', 'Z']`.\n- The second column `['P', 'T', 'I']` becomes the second row `['I', 'T', 'P']`.\n- The third column `['E', 'V', 'V']` becomes the third row `['V', 'V', 'E']`.\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'P', 'E'],\n    ['Z', 'T', 'V'],\n    ['G', 'I', 'V']\n]\n\n# Rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = []\nn = len(matrix)\nfor i in range(n):\n    new_row = [matrix[j][i] for j in range(n-1, -1, -1)]\n    rotated_matrix.append(new_row)\n\n# Flatten the rotated matrix to a single list\nflattened_result = [item for sublist in rotated_matrix for item in sublist]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(flattened_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the result is a flattened list of the rotated matrix.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\nG Z Z\nI T P\nV V E\n```\n\nFlattened, this becomes: `['G', 'Z', 'Z', 'I', 'T', 'P', 'V', 'V', 'E']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<G,Z,Z,I,T,P,V,V,E>>>"
