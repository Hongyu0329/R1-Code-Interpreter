    "\nassistant > To solve the Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears only once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's implement a backtracking algorithm to find the solution. \n\nFirst, let's represent the given Sudoku grid as a 9x9 matrix, where empty cells are denoted by zeros.
