    "To solve the Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. This is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that can be efficiently solved using backtracking.\n\nLet's represent the given Sudoku grid as a 2D list in Python, where empty cells are denoted by 0. We will then implement a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Define a function to check if placing a number in a given cell is valid.\n2. Implement the backtracking algorithm to try filling the grid.\n3. Print the completed grid once a solution is found.\n\nLet's write the code to solve the Sudoku puzzle.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if the number is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(9):\n        if board[row][i] == num or board[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check if the number is not in the current 3x3 subgrid\n    start_row, start_col = 3 * (row // 3), 3 * (col // 3)\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if board[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num:\n                return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_sudoku(board):\n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(9):\n            if board[row][col] == 0:  # Find an empty cell\n                for num in range(1, 10):  # Try numbers 1 to 9\n                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n                        board[row][col] = num  # Place the number\n                        if solve_sudoku(board):  # Recursively solve the rest\n                            return True\n                        board[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack if not solvable\n                return False  # No valid number found, trigger backtracking\n    return True  # Solved\n\n# Initial Sudoku grid with 0 representing empty cells\nsudoku_grid = [\n    [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 9],\n    [0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3],\n    [2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 0, 8, 1],\n    [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 7, 4, 0],\n    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n    [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_sudoku(sudoku_grid)\nprint(sudoku_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking and print the completed grid.
