    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pre-filled Cells:**\n   - The given grid has some numbers already filled in. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach to Solve the Puzzle:**\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try filling the empty cells.\n   - For each empty cell, try placing a number from 1 to 9.\n   - Check if placing the number violates any Sudoku rules (row, column, or subgrid).\n   - If it doesn't violate any rules, place the number and move to the next empty cell.\n   - If it does violate the rules, try the next number.\n   - If no number can be placed, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Grid:**\n   - Start from the top-left corner and move row by row, column by column.\n   - For each empty cell, apply the backtracking approach.\n\n5. **Check for Solution:**\n   - Continue the process until all cells are filled correctly.\n   - If the grid is completely filled without any rule violations, the puzzle is solved.\n\n6. **Output the Solution:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, present the solution in a 9x9 matrix format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Sudoku grid is:\n\n```\n8 5 3 6 2 4 9 7 1\n4 9 2 3 8 7 1 6 5\n6 7 1 5 9 5 4 2 3\n1 3 4 2 6 8 5 9 7\n2 8 9 4 5 1 7 6 1\n5 6 7 1 7 3 8 4 2\n7 4 5 9 3 6 2 1 8\n3 1 6 8 4 2 5 3 9\n9 2 8 7 1 1 3 5 6\n```\n\nThis is the completed Sudoku grid."
