    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and their positions:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers. We need to identify these numbers and their positions to understand the constraints they impose on the empty cells.\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Use a backtracking algorithm:**\n   - Start from the first empty cell and try to fill it with a number from 1 to 9.\n   - Check if the number is valid by ensuring it does not violate the constraints of the row, column, and subgrid.\n   - If the number is valid, move to the next empty cell and repeat the process.\n   - If a number is not valid, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next possible number.\n   - Continue this process until the entire grid is filled correctly.\n\n4. **Iterate through the grid:**\n   - Begin with the first row and move from left to right, top to bottom.\n   - For each empty cell, try placing numbers 1 to 9 and check for validity.\n   - Use recursion to handle the backtracking process.\n\n5. **Check for completion:**\n   - The puzzle is complete when all cells are filled without any constraint violations.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the Sudoku grid correctly. Here is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n5, 6, 2, 8, 1, 4, 7, 9, 3\n7, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2, 8, 4, 5\n4, 9, 8, 7, 5, 3, 1, 3, 6\n2, 5, 1, 3, 8, 7, 6, 2, 4\n6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 7\n8, 7, 4, 2, 3, 1, 9, 5, 2\n1, 4, 7, 1, 6, 5, 3, 8, 9\n3, 2, 5, 9, 7, 8, 4, 6, 1\n9, 8, 6, 4, 2, 9, 5, 7, 9\n>>>"
