    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pre-filled Cells:**\n   - The given grid has some numbers already filled in. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells.\n   - Start from the first empty cell and try placing numbers from 1 to 9.\n   - For each number, check if it violates any of the Sudoku constraints (row, column, subgrid).\n   - If a number is valid, place it and move to the next empty cell.\n   - If no number is valid, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.\n   - Continue this process until the entire grid is filled.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Begin with the first empty cell in the top-left corner and proceed row by row.\n   - For each empty cell, try placing numbers 1 to 9 and check for validity.\n   - Use the constraints to eliminate possibilities and reduce the number of trials.\n   - If stuck, backtrack to the previous decision point and try a different number.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling all cells while respecting the constraints, the grid should be complete.\n\nHere is the completed Sudoku grid:\n\n<<<\n1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7\n4, 6, 9, 2, 7, 8, 3, 1, 5\n7, 8, 3, 5, 1, 9, 7, 2, 4\n2, 9, 8, 7, 5, 6, 1, 4, 3\n5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 3, 4, 6, 1\n3, 4, 1, 8, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9\n6, 1, 5, 4, 9, 7, 2, 3, 8\n8, 3, 7, 6, 5, 2, 1, 9, 9\n9, 8, 4, 1, 3, 1, 5, 5, 6\n>>>"
