    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: Start by noting the numbers that are already filled in the grid. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Check each row, column, and subgrid**: For each empty cell, determine which numbers are possible candidates by checking the numbers already present in the same row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.\n\n3. **Use the process of elimination**: If a number is already present in a row, column, or subgrid, it cannot be placed in the empty cell. This helps narrow down the possible candidates for each cell.\n\n4. **Fill in the cells with a single candidate**: If an empty cell has only one possible candidate, fill it in with that number.\n\n5. **Iterate and update**: After filling in some cells, the constraints on other cells may change, allowing further cells to be filled. Repeat the process of checking and filling until the grid is complete.\n\n6. **Backtracking if necessary**: If you reach a point where no cells can be filled, you may need to backtrack and try different possibilities for previously filled cells.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Sudoku grid is:\n\n```\n8 1 6 9 2 3 4 7 5\n9 2 3 1 5 7 8 6 4\n7 5 4 8 6 2 9 3 1\n5 6 2 3 4 9 7 1 8\n3 7 9 5 8 6 1 2 4\n1 4 8 7 9 1 6 5 3\n4 5 7 6 1 8 3 9 2\n6 9 1 2 3 4 7 5 8\n2 3 5 4 7 5 2 1 6\n```\n\nThis is the completed Sudoku grid."
