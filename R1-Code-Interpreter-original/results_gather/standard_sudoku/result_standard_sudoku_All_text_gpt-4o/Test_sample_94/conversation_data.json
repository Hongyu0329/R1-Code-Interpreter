    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pre-filled Cells:**\n   - The given grid has some numbers already filled in. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells.\n   - Start from the first empty cell and try placing numbers from 1 to 9.\n   - For each number, check if it violates any of the Sudoku rules (row, column, subgrid).\n   - If a number is valid, place it and move to the next empty cell.\n   - If no number is valid, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.\n   - Continue this process until the entire grid is filled.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Begin with the first empty cell in the grid.\n   - Check each number from 1 to 9 for validity.\n   - Place the number if it doesn't violate any rules.\n   - Move to the next empty cell and repeat the process.\n   - If stuck, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling all cells correctly, the grid will be a valid Sudoku solution.\n\nHere is the completed Sudoku grid:\n\n<<<\n9,8,1,6,3,4,2,7,5\n2,3,6,1,5,7,4,9,8\n5,4,7,9,2,8,6,1,3\n7,2,9,4,8,3,1,5,6\n3,6,8,5,7,9,9,4,2\n4,5,1,2,6,1,3,8,7\n1,7,2,8,9,5,7,3,4\n6,9,5,3,1,6,8,2,9\n8,1,3,7,4,2,5,6,1\n>>>"
