    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pre-filled Cells:**\n   - The given grid has some numbers already filled in. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells.\n   - Start from the first empty cell and try placing numbers from 1 to 9.\n   - For each number, check if it is valid by ensuring it does not violate the Sudoku constraints.\n   - If a number is valid, place it in the cell and move to the next empty cell.\n   - If no valid number can be placed, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.\n   - Continue this process until the entire grid is filled.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Begin with the first row and move left to right, top to bottom.\n   - For each empty cell, try numbers 1 to 9.\n   - Check the row, column, and 3x3 subgrid for each number to ensure it is not already present.\n   - If a number fits, place it and proceed to the next cell.\n   - If stuck, backtrack and try the next possible number for the previous cell.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling all cells while respecting the constraints, the grid will be complete.\n\nHere is the completed Sudoku grid:\n\n<<<\n5,8,6,1,3,4,2,9,5\n7,1,5,2,6,9,3,8,4\n3,9,2,5,8,7,6,1,7\n4,3,1,7,2,5,9,6,8\n6,7,8,9,1,3,4,2,2\n8,2,9,6,4,8,1,5,3\n2,5,3,8,7,6,7,4,1\n9,4,1,6,5,2,7,8,6\n1,6,7,3,9,1,5,2,9\n>>>"
