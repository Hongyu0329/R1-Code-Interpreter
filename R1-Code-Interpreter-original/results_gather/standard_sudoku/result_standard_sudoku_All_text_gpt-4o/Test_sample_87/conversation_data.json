    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pre-filled Cells:**\n   - The given grid has some numbers already filled in. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells.\n   - Start from the first empty cell and try placing numbers from 1 to 9.\n   - For each number, check if it violates any of the Sudoku rules (row, column, subgrid).\n   - If a number is valid, place it and move to the next empty cell.\n   - If no number is valid, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.\n   - Continue this process until the entire grid is filled.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Begin with the first empty cell in the top-left corner and proceed row by row.\n   - For each empty cell, determine the possible numbers that can be placed without violating the Sudoku rules.\n   - Use logical deduction to fill in cells where only one number is possible.\n   - For cells with multiple possibilities, use trial and error with backtracking.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After applying the above steps, the completed Sudoku grid is:\n\n```\n5, 8, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 1, 9\n9, 1, 6, 8, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7\n7, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 8, 4, 1\n4, 5, 9, 3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7\n6, 3, 8, 4, 9, 5, 1, 9, 2\n2, 7, 1, 9, 7, 8, 4, 3, 5\n8, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 4\n3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2\n1, 4, 5, 1, 8, 3, 9, 7, 6\n```\n\n<<<\n5, 8, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 1, 9\n9, 1, 6, 8, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7\n7, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 8, 4, 1\n4, 5, 9, 3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7\n6, 3, 8, 4, 9, 5, 1, 9, 2\n2, 7, 1, 9, 7, 8, 4, 3, 5\n8, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 4\n3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2\n1, 4, 5, 1, 8, 3, 9, 7, 6\n>>>"
