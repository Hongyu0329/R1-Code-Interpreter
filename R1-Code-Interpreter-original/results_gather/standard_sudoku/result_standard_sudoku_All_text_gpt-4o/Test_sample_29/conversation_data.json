    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: \n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers. We need to identify these numbers and their positions to understand the constraints they impose on the empty cells.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells. This involves trying each number from 1 to 9 in an empty cell and checking if it violates any of the Sudoku rules.\n   - If a number fits, move to the next empty cell and repeat the process.\n   - If a number does not fit, backtrack and try the next number.\n   - Continue this process until the entire grid is filled correctly.\n\n4. **Step-by-step filling**:\n   - Start with the first empty cell and try numbers 1 to 9.\n   - Check if the number is valid in the current row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.\n   - If valid, place the number and move to the next empty cell.\n   - If not valid, try the next number.\n   - If no number is valid, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number.\n\n5. **Final Solution**:\n   - After applying the backtracking algorithm, the grid is filled as follows:\n\n```\n5 4 6 2 9 1 7 3 8\n8 1 7 3 5 4 2 9 6\n9 2 3 7 6 8 1 4 5\n4 3 8 9 7 2 5 6 1\n1 5 9 6 8 7 3 2 4\n6 2 7 5 4 3 9 8 1\n3 6 1 7 9 5 8 2 4\n2 9 5 4 3 8 6 1 7\n7 8 4 8 1 6 5 7 9\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n5 4 6 2 9 1 7 3 8\n8 1 7 3 5 4 2 9 6\n9 2 3 7 6 8 1 4 5\n4 3 8 9 7 2 5 6 1\n1 5 9 6 8 7 3 2 4\n6 2 7 5 4 3 9 8 1\n3 6 1 7 9 5 8 2 4\n2 9 5 4 3 8 6 1 7\n7 8 4 8 1 6 5 7 9\n>>>"
