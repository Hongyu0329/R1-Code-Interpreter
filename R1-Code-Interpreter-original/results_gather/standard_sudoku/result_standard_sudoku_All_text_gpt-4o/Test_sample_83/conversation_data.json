    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pre-filled Cells:**\n   - The given grid has some numbers already filled in. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach to Solve the Puzzle:**\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try filling the empty cells.\n   - For each empty cell, try placing a number from 1 to 9.\n   - Check if placing the number violates any Sudoku rules (row, column, or subgrid).\n   - If it doesn't violate any rules, move to the next empty cell.\n   - If it does violate a rule, try the next number.\n   - If no number can be placed in a cell, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Grid:**\n   - Start from the top-left corner and move row by row, column by column.\n   - For each empty cell, apply the backtracking approach.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Continue the process until all cells are filled correctly.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - After filling the grid, verify that all rows, columns, and subgrids contain unique numbers from 1 to 9.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the Sudoku grid. Here is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n3, 9, 1, 6, 2, 8, 5, 4, 7\n5, 2, 7, 3, 1, 9, 6, 8, 4\n6, 8, 4, 7, 5, 3, 9, 1, 2\n1, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 4, 9, 8\n7, 6, 2, 5, 8, 4, 1, 7, 3\n8, 4, 9, 3, 9, 1, 7, 6, 5\n4, 1, 8, 9, 7, 6, 2, 3, 5\n9, 7, 6, 8, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1\n2, 5, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6\n>>>"
