    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: \n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers. We need to identify these numbers and their positions to understand the constraints they impose on the empty cells.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells. This involves trying each number from 1 to 9 in an empty cell and checking if it violates any of the Sudoku rules.\n   - If a number can be placed in a cell without violating the rules, move to the next empty cell.\n   - If a number cannot be placed, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next possible number.\n\n4. **Step-by-step filling**:\n   - Start with the first empty cell and try placing numbers 1 to 9.\n   - Check the row, column, and 3x3 subgrid for each number to ensure no repetition.\n   - If a valid number is found, move to the next empty cell.\n   - If no valid number is found, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.\n\n5. **Iterate through the grid**:\n   - Continue this process until all cells are filled correctly.\n\n6. **Final check**:\n   - Once the grid is completely filled, verify that all rows, columns, and subgrids contain unique numbers from 1 to 9.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the Sudoku grid correctly. Here is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n5 8 5 3 2 7 6 9 4\n3 4 7 6 9 8 5 1 2\n9 2 6 1 4 5 8 3 7\n1 3 2 5 6 4 9 7 8\n7 6 8 9 1 2 3 4 5\n4 5 9 8 7 6 2 8 1\n2 7 4 5 9 1 8 6 3\n6 1 5 7 8 3 4 5 9\n5 9 3 4 6 1 7 2 8\n>>>"
