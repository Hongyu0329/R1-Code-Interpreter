    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pre-filled Cells:**\n   - The given grid has some numbers already filled in. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells.\n   - Start from the first empty cell and try placing numbers from 1 to 9.\n   - For each number, check if it is valid by ensuring it does not violate the row, column, or subgrid constraints.\n   - If a number is valid, place it and move to the next empty cell.\n   - If no valid number can be placed, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.\n   - Continue this process until the entire grid is filled.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Begin with the first row and move left to right, top to bottom.\n   - For each empty cell, try placing numbers 1 to 9.\n   - Check the validity of each number by ensuring it does not already exist in the current row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.\n   - If a valid number is found, place it and proceed to the next cell.\n   - If stuck, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next possible number.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling all cells while respecting the constraints, the grid will be complete.\n\nHere is the completed Sudoku grid:\n\n<<<\n3, 5, 6, 2, 7, 4, 8, 1, 9\n9, 2, 8, 5, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2\n7, 4, 1, 9, 8, 2, 5, 6, 3\n5, 3, 4, 1, 6, 8, 9, 7, 2\n6, 1, 9, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 8\n2, 8, 5, 3, 9, 7, 6, 9, 4\n8, 9, 7, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6\n1, 4, 3, 8, 5, 1, 7, 2, 5\n4, 6, 2, 6, 2, 3, 8, 9, 7\n>>>"
