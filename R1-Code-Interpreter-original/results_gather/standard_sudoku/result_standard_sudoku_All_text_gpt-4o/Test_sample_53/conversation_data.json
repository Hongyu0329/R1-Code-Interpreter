    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: Start by noting the numbers that are already filled in the grid. These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n2. **Check each row, column, and subgrid**: For each empty cell, determine which numbers are possible candidates by checking the numbers already present in the same row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.\n\n3. **Use the process of elimination**: For each empty cell, eliminate numbers that are already present in the corresponding row, column, and subgrid. The remaining numbers are potential candidates for that cell.\n\n4. **Fill in cells with a single candidate**: If a cell has only one possible candidate, fill it in with that number.\n\n5. **Use advanced strategies if necessary**: If no cells can be filled using the above steps, use more advanced strategies such as looking for naked pairs, hidden singles, or using backtracking to try different possibilities.\n\n6. **Repeat the process**: Continue filling in cells and using elimination until the entire grid is filled.\n\n7. **Verify the solution**: Once the grid is completely filled, verify that each row, column, and subgrid contains all numbers from 1 to 9 with no repetitions.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Sudoku grid is:\n\n<<<\n5,7,2,9,3,1,4,6,8\n9,4,3,8,6,2,1,5,7\n1,8,6,4,5,7,3,2,9\n3,2,1,5,4,9,6,7,6\n4,6,9,7,1,8,5,3,2\n7,8,5,6,2,3,9,1,4\n9,5,8,3,7,4,2,9,1\n2,6,7,2,9,1,8,4,5\n8,1,4,6,9,5,7,8,3\n>>>"
