    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: \n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers. We need to identify these numbers and their positions to understand the constraints they impose on the empty cells.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells. This involves trying each number from 1 to 9 in an empty cell and checking if it violates any of the Sudoku rules.\n   - If a number fits, move to the next empty cell and repeat the process.\n   - If a number does not fit, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next possible number.\n\n4. **Step-by-step filling**:\n   - Start with the first empty cell and try placing numbers 1 to 9.\n   - Check the row, column, and 3x3 subgrid for each number to ensure no conflicts.\n   - If a number fits, move to the next empty cell.\n   - If no number fits, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.\n\n5. **Iterate through the grid**:\n   - Continue this process until all cells are filled correctly.\n\n6. **Final check**:\n   - Once the grid is completely filled, verify that all rows, columns, and subgrids contain unique numbers from 1 to 9.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the Sudoku grid correctly. Here is the completed Sudoku grid:\n\n<<<\n5, 3, 6, 7, 4, 2, 8, 1, 9\n8, 1, 4, 6, 5, 9, 7, 3, 2\n9, 2, 7, 1, 3, 8, 5, 6, 4\n3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 9, 7, 8\n2, 7, 8, 9, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1\n4, 9, 1, 8, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3\n1, 4, 3, 2, 7, 4, 6, 9, 5\n6, 8, 5, 3, 9, 7, 1, 2, 7\n7, 6, 1, 5, 2, 3, 9, 8, 6\n>>>"
