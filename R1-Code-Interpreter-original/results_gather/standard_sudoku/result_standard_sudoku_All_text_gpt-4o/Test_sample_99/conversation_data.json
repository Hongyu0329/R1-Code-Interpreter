    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: \n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers. We need to identify these numbers and their positions to understand the constraints they impose on the empty cells.\n\n2. **Understand the constraints**:\n   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n   - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n3. **Use a systematic approach**:\n   - Start with the first empty cell and try to fill it with a number that doesn't violate the Sudoku rules.\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm: If a number doesn't fit, backtrack and try the next possible number.\n   - Continue this process for each empty cell until the entire grid is filled.\n\n4. **Check for conflicts**:\n   - After placing a number, check the row, column, and subgrid for any conflicts.\n   - If a conflict is found, remove the number and try the next possible number.\n\n5. **Repeat until the grid is complete**:\n   - Continue filling the grid using the above steps until all cells are filled correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the Sudoku grid. Here is the completed grid:\n\n```\n5,8,9,1,4,2,7,3,6\n3,6,7,5,1,8,2,4,9\n1,4,2,3,6,9,4,5,7\n6,7,3,2,5,1,9,8,4\n2,9,8,6,7,5,3,1,5\n7,5,4,8,3,6,1,9,2\n4,2,1,9,8,7,5,9,3\n9,3,5,4,2,3,6,7,8\n8,1,6,7,9,4,3,2,5\n```\n\nNote: The above solution is based on the assumption that the given puzzle is solvable and follows the standard Sudoku rules."
