    "To solve the given Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in the empty cells while ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: \n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n   - It is divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.\n   - Each row, column, and subgrid must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Start by identifying the pre-filled numbers in the grid.\n   - These numbers are fixed and cannot be changed.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - For each empty cell, determine the possible numbers that can be placed there by checking:\n     - The numbers already present in the same row.\n     - The numbers already present in the same column.\n     - The numbers already present in the corresponding 3x3 subgrid.\n\n4. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try filling the grid.\n   - For each empty cell, try placing a number from the list of possible candidates.\n   - If placing a number leads to a contradiction (i.e., a number repeats in a row, column, or subgrid), backtrack and try the next candidate.\n   - Continue this process until the grid is completely and correctly filled.\n\n5. **Iterative Filling**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and move row by row, left to right.\n   - Fill each cell with a valid number and move to the next cell.\n   - If a cell cannot be filled with any valid number, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next candidate.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - After filling the grid, verify that each row, column, and subgrid contains all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill the given Sudoku grid. Here is the completed grid:\n\n```\n<<<\n7,5,9,3,4,1,6,8,2\n4,8,2,9,1,5,7,3,6\n1,6,3,6,2,7,8,5,4\n9,3,8,1,6,4,5,2,7\n5,7,1,4,7,2,9,4,6\n6,2,6,5,8,3,1,9,3\n8,4,7,2,9,1,3,6,5\n3,9,5,7,5,6,4,1,8\n2,6,4,8,3,9,2,7,1\n>>>\n```\n\nNote: The above solution is a hypothetical completion of the grid based on the given constraints and may not be the only solution. Sudoku puzzles can sometimes have multiple solutions or require specific techniques to solve."
