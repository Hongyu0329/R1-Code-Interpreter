    "To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence of states that transition from the initial state to the goal state, adhering to the constraints provided. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State and Goal State:**\n   - Initial State: \n     - box1: C1,3\n     - box2: C2,4\n     - box3: C1,6\n     - box4: C2,2\n     - box5: C1,4\n   - Goal State:\n     - box1: C2,1\n     - box2: C1,2\n     - box3: C1,5\n     - box4: C2,2\n     - box5: C2,6\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each box can only move to an adjacent cell.\n   - Each cell can only have one box at a time.\n   - If a box is at its goal, it should remain there.\n\n3. **Plan Construction:**\n   - We need to move each box from its initial position to its goal position, ensuring that no two boxes occupy the same cell at the same time.\n   - We will move one box at a time, ensuring that each move is valid according to the adjacency list.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Plan:**\n   - Start with the initial state.\n   - Move box1 from C1,3 to C2,3, then to C2,2, and finally to C2,1.\n   - Move box2 from C2,4 to C2,3, then to C2,2, and finally to C1,2.\n   - Move box3 from C1,6 to C1,5.\n   - Box4 is already at its goal (C2,2), so it remains there.\n   - Move box5 from C1,4 to C1,5, then to C2,5, and finally to C2,6.\n\n5. **Final Plan:**\n   - We will list each state in the sequence, ensuring that each move is valid and that the final state matches the goal state.\n\nHere is the sequence of states:\n\n<<<[\n  {\"box1\": \"C1,3\", \"box2\": \"C2,4\", \"box3\": \"C1,6\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C1,4\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,3\", \"box2\": \"C2,4\", \"box3\": \"C1,6\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C1,4\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,2\", \"box2\": \"C2,4\", \"box3\": \"C1,6\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C1,4\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,1\", \"box2\": \"C2,4\", \"box3\": \"C1,6\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C1,4\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,1\", \"box2\": \"C2,3\", \"box3\": \"C1,6\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C1,4\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,1\", \"box2\": \"C2,2\", \"box3\": \"C1,6\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C1,4\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,1\", \"box2\": \"C1,2\", \"box3\": \"C1,6\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C1,4\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,1\", \"box2\": \"C1,2\", \"box3\": \"C1,5\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C1,4\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,1\", \"box2\": \"C1,2\", \"box3\": \"C1,5\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C2,5\"},\n  {\"box1\": \"C2,1\", \"box2\": \"C1,2\", \"box3\": \"C1,5\", \"box4\": \"C2,2\", \"box5\": \"C2,6\"}\n]>>>"
