    "To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence of states that move each box from its initial location to its goal location, adhering to the constraints provided. The constraints include moving boxes only to adjacent cells and ensuring that each cell can only have one box at a time.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n1. **Initial and Goal States**: We have the initial and goal states for each box. We need to ensure that the first state in our plan is the initial state and the last state is the goal state.\n\n2. **Movement Constraints**: Each box can only move to an adjacent cell. We need to ensure that no two boxes occupy the same cell at the same time.\n\n3. **Plan Construction**: We'll construct the plan step-by-step, ensuring that each move is valid according to the adjacency list and that no two boxes are in the same cell at the same time.\n\n4. **Algorithm**: We'll use a simple breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path for each box from its initial position to its goal position. We'll then combine these paths into a single plan, ensuring that the constraints are met.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the plan:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    \"box1\": \"C1,4\",\n    \"box2\": \"C2,8\",\n    \"box3\": \"C2,2\",\n    \"box4\": \"C2,1\"\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    \"box1\": \"C2,8\",\n    \"box2\": \"C2,2\",\n    \"box3\": \"C1,2\",\n    \"box4\": \"C2,5\"\n}\n\n# Adjacency list\nadjacency = {\n    \"C1,1\": [\"C1,2\", \"C2,1\"],\n    \"C1,2\": [\"C1,1\", \"C1,3\", \"C2,2\"],\n    \"C1,3\": [\"C1,2\", \"C1,4\", \"C2,3\"],\n    \"C1,4\": [\"C1,3\", \"C1,5\", \"C2,4\"],\n    \"C1,5\": [\"C1,4\", \"C1,6\", \"C2,5\"],\n    \"C1,6\": [\"C1,5\", \"C1,7\", \"C2,6\"],\n    \"C1,7\": [\"C1,6\", \"C1,8\", \"C2,7\"],\n    \"C1,8\": [\"C1,7\", \"C2,8\"],\n    \"C2,1\": [\"C2,2\", \"C1,1\"],\n    \"C2,2\": [\"C2,1\", \"C2,3\", \"C1,2\"],\n    \"C2,3\": [\"C2,2\", \"C2,4\", \"C1,3\"],\n    \"C2,4\": [\"C2,3\", \"C2,5\", \"C1,4\"],\n    \"C2,5\": [\"C2,4\", \"C2,6\", \"C1,5\"],\n    \"C2,6\": [\"C2,5\", \"C2,7\", \"C1,6\"],\n    \"C2,7\": [\"C2,6\", \"C2,8\", \"C1,7\"],\n    \"C2,8\": [\"C2,7\", \"C1,8\"]\n}\n\n# Function to find the shortest path for a single box\ndef find_path(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    while queue:\n        current, path = queue.popleft()\n        if current == goal:\n            return path\n        for neighbor in adjacency[current]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))\n    return []\n\n# Find paths for each box\npaths = {box: find_path(initial_state[box], goal_state[box]) for box in initial_state}\n\n# Generate the plan\nplan = []\ncurrent_state = initial_state.copy()\nplan.append(current_state.copy())\n\n# Iterate over the longest path length\nmax_length = max(len(path) for path in paths.values())\nfor i in range(1, max_length):\n    for box, path in paths.items():\n        if i < len(path):\n            current_state[box] = path[i]\n    plan.append(current_state.copy())\n\nprint(plan)\n```\n\nThis code will generate a plan that moves each box from its initial position to its goal position, ensuring that the constraints are met. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code successfully generated a sequence of states that move each box from its initial location to its goal location. However, we need to ensure that the final state matches the goal state exactly and that the plan adheres to all constraints, including not moving boxes that have already reached their goal.\n\nLet's review the output and ensure it meets the requirements:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The first state in the output matches the initial state, which is correct.\n\n2. **Goal State**: The final state should match the goal state exactly. Let's verify this:\n\n   - `box1` should be in `C2,8`.\n   - `box2` should be in `C2,2`.\n   - `box3` should be in `C1,2`.\n   - `box4` should be in `C2,5`.\n\n3. **Intermediate States**: Each move should be valid according to the adjacency list, and no two boxes should occupy the same cell at the same time.\n\nThe final state in the output is:\n- `box1`: `C2,8`\n- `box2`: `C2,2`\n- `box3`: `C1,2`\n- `box4`: `C2,5`\n\nThis matches the goal state, so the plan is correct. The intermediate states also respect the adjacency constraints and ensure no two boxes are in the same cell simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the plan is valid and meets all the requirements.\n\n<<<[{'box1': 'C1,4', 'box2': 'C2,8', 'box3': 'C2,2', 'box4': 'C2,1'}, {'box1': 'C1,5', 'box2': 'C2,7', 'box3': 'C1,2', 'box4': 'C2,2'}, {'box1': 'C1,6', 'box2': 'C2,6', 'box3': 'C1,2', 'box4': 'C2,3'}, {'box1': 'C1,7', 'box2': 'C2,5', 'box3': 'C1,2', 'box4': 'C2,4'}, {'box1': 'C1,8', 'box2': 'C2,4', 'box3': 'C1,2', 'box4': 'C2,5'}, {'box1': 'C2,8', 'box2': 'C2,3', 'box3': 'C1,2', 'box4': 'C2,5'}, {'box1': 'C2,8', 'box2': 'C2,2', 'box3': 'C1,2', 'box4': 'C2,5'}]>>>"
