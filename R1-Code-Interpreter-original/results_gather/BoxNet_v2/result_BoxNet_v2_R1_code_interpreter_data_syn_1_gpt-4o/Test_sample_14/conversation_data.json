    "To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence of states that transition from the initial state to the goal state, adhering to the constraints provided. The constraints include moving boxes only to adjacent cells and ensuring that each cell can only contain one box at a time.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with the given initial state of the boxes.\n2. **Goal State**: We need to reach the goal state where each box is in its designated goal location.\n3. **Movement Constraints**: \n   - A box can only move to an adjacent cell.\n   - Only one box can be in a cell at any time.\n   - If a box is already at its goal location, it should remain there.\n\n4. **Plan Generation**: We will generate a plan by simulating the movement of boxes from their initial positions to their goal positions, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a simple breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore possible movements of the boxes. However, given the simplicity of the grid and the constraints, a greedy approach that moves each box directly towards its goal might suffice.\n\nLet's implement a simple greedy algorithm to generate the plan:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    \"box1\": \"C1,3\",\n    \"box2\": \"C2,4\",\n    \"box3\": \"C1,6\",\n    \"box4\": \"C2,2\",\n    \"box5\": \"C1,4\"\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    \"box1\": \"C2,1\",\n    \"box2\": \"C1,2\",\n    \"box3\": \"C1,5\",\n    \"box4\": \"C2,2\",\n    \"box5\": \"C2,6\"\n}\n\n# Adjacency list\nadjacency = {\n    \"C1,1\": [\"C1,2\", \"C2,1\"],\n    \"C1,2\": [\"C1,1\", \"C1,3\", \"C2,2\"],\n    \"C1,3\": [\"C1,2\", \"C1,4\", \"C2,3\"],\n    \"C1,4\": [\"C1,3\", \"C1,5\", \"C2,4\"],\n    \"C1,5\": [\"C1,4\", \"C1,6\", \"C2,5\"],\n    \"C1,6\": [\"C1,5\", \"C2,6\"],\n    \"C2,1\": [\"C2,2\", \"C1,1\"],\n    \"C2,2\": [\"C2,1\", \"C2,3\", \"C1,2\"],\n    \"C2,3\": [\"C2,2\", \"C2,4\", \"C1,3\"],\n    \"C2,4\": [\"C2,3\", \"C2,5\", \"C1,4\"],\n    \"C2,5\": [\"C2,4\", \"C2,6\", \"C1,5\"],\n    \"C2,6\": [\"C2,5\", \"C1,6\"]\n}\n\n# Function to generate the plan\ndef generate_plan(initial_state, goal_state, adjacency):\n    plan = [initial_state.copy()]\n    current_state = initial_state.copy()\n\n    while current_state != goal_state:\n        for box, current_pos in current_state.items():\n            if current_pos != goal_state[box]:\n                # Move the box towards its goal\n                for neighbor in adjacency[current_pos]:\n                    if neighbor == goal_state[box]:\n                        current_state[box] = neighbor\n                        break\n                    # Ensure no other box is in the target cell\n                    if neighbor not in current_state.values():\n                        current_state[box] = neighbor\n                        break\n        plan.append(current_state.copy())\n\n    return plan\n\n# Generate the plan\nplan = generate_plan(initial_state, goal_state, adjacency)\n\n# Print the plan in JSON format\nprint(json.dumps(plan, indent=2))\n```\n\nThis code will generate a sequence of states that transition from the initial state to the goal state, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.

    "The timeout error suggests that the code took too long to execute, likely due to an inefficient approach or an infinite loop.

Between successive states, a box may either remain in its current cell or move to an adjacent cell (as defined in the adjacency list).\n  4. Each cell contains only one arm. Hence, in each cell at most one box can be moved at a time to the adjacent cell.\n  5. If a box is at its goal cell, no further action needed for this box. Just keeping it at the goal cell.\n  6. Represent each cell state as its current cell location.\n\nIn the end of your answer return a list of states and surround it with <<<>>>, such as\n<<<[{\"box1\": \"C1,2\", \"box2\": \"C2,3\"}, {\"box1\": \"C1,3\", \"box2\": \"C2,3\"}, ...]>>>.\n\nYour answer:\n",
