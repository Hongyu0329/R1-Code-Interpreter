    "To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence of states that transition from the initial state to the goal state, adhering to the constraints provided. The constraints include moving boxes only to adjacent cells and ensuring that each cell can only have one box at a time.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Start with the initial state of the boxes.\n2. **Goal State**: Define the goal state for the boxes.\n3. **Adjacency Constraints**: Use the adjacency list to determine valid moves for each box.\n4. **Plan Generation**: Generate a sequence of states where each state is a valid configuration of boxes, transitioning from the initial state to the goal state.\n5. **Constraints**: Ensure that no two boxes occupy the same cell at any time, and a box can only move to an adjacent cell.\n\nWe'll use a simple approach to move each box towards its goal, one step at a time, ensuring that no two boxes occupy the same cell.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are given the following planning problem:\n\nGrid dimensions: 2 x 6\nCells: ['C1,1', 'C1,2', 'C1,3', 'C1,4', 'C1,5', 'C1,6', 'C2,1', 'C2,2', 'C2,3', 'C2,4', 'C2,5', 'C2,6']\nAdjacency: {\n  \"C1,1\": [\n    \"C1,2\",\n    \"C2,1\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,2\": [\n    \"C1,1\",\n    \"C1,3\",\n    \"C2,2\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,3\": [\n    \"C1,2\",\n    \"C1,4\",\n    \"C2,3\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,4\": [\n    \"C1,3\",\n    \"C1,5\",\n    \"C2,4\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,5\": [\n    \"C1,4\",\n    \"C1,6\",\n    \"C2,5\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,6\": [\n    \"C1,5\",\n    \"C2,6\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,1\": [\n    \"C2,2\",\n    \"C1,1\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,2\": [\n    \"C2,1\",\n    \"C2,3\",\n    \"C1,2\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,3\": [\n    \"C2,2\",\n    \"C2,4\",\n    \"C1,3\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,4\": [\n    \"C2,3\",\n    \"C2,5\",\n    \"C1,4\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,5\": [\n    \"C2,4\",\n    \"C2,6\",\n    \"C1,5\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,6\": [\n    \"C2,5\",\n    \"C1,6\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThere is one robot arm in each cell: ['C1,1', 'C1,2', 'C1,3', 'C1,4', 'C1,5', 'C1,6', 'C2,1', 'C2,2', 'C2,3', 'C2,4', 'C2,5', 'C2,6']\n\nBoxes: ['box1', 'box2', 'box3', 'box4', 'box5']\nInitial state: {\n  \"box1\": \"C1,3\",\n  \"box2\": \"C2,4\",\n  \"box3\": \"C1,6\",\n  \"box4\": \"C2,2\",\n  \"box5\": \"C1,4\"\n}\nGoal locations: {\n  \"box1\": \"C2,1\",\n  \"box2\": \"C1,2\",\n  \"box3\": \"C1,5\",\n  \"box4\": \"C2,2\",\n  \"box5\": \"C2,6\"\n}\n\nTask: Generate a plan as a JSON-formatted list representing the states at successive time steps.\nEach state is a dictionary mapping each box to its current cell location.\nThe plan must satisfy the following:\n  1. The first state equals the initial state.\n  2. The final state equals the goal state (i.e. each box is located in the same cell as its goal).\n  3. Between successive states, a box may either remain in its current cell or move to an adjacent cell (as defined in the adjacency list).\n  4. Each cell contains only one arm. Hence, in each cell at most one box can be moved at a time to the adjacent cell.\n  5. If a box is at its goal cell, no further action needed for this box. Just keeping it at the goal cell.\n  6. Represent each cell state as its current cell location.\n\nIn the end of your answer return a list of states and surround it with <<<>>>, such as\n<<<[{\"box1\": \"C1,2\", \"box2\": \"C2,3\"}, {\"box1\": \"C1,3\", \"box2\": \"C2,3\"}, ...]>>>.\n\nYour answer:\n",
