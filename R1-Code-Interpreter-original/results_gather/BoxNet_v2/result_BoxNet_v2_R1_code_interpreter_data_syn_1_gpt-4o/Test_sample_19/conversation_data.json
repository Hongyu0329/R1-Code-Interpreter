    "To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence of states that move each box from its initial location to its goal location, adhering to the constraints provided. The constraints include moving boxes only to adjacent cells and ensuring that each cell can only have one box at a time.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n1. **Initial and Goal States**: We have the initial and goal states for each box. We need to ensure that the first state in our plan matches the initial state and the last state matches the goal state.\n\n2. **Movement Constraints**: Each box can only move to an adjacent cell. We need to ensure that no two boxes occupy the same cell at the same time.\n\n3. **Plan Construction**: We'll construct the plan step-by-step, ensuring that each move is valid according to the adjacency list and that no two boxes are in the same cell at the same time.\n\n4. **Algorithm**: We'll use a simple breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore possible moves for each box, ensuring that we reach the goal state for each box.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the plan:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    \"box1\": \"C1,4\",\n    \"box2\": \"C2,8\",\n    \"box3\": \"C2,2\",\n    \"box4\": \"C2,1\"\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    \"box1\": \"C2,8\",\n    \"box2\": \"C2,2\",\n    \"box3\": \"C1,2\",\n    \"box4\": \"C2,5\"\n}\n\n# Adjacency list\nadjacency = {\n    \"C1,1\": [\"C1,2\", \"C2,1\"],\n    \"C1,2\": [\"C1,1\", \"C1,3\", \"C2,2\"],\n    \"C1,3\": [\"C1,2\", \"C1,4\", \"C2,3\"],\n    \"C1,4\": [\"C1,3\", \"C1,5\", \"C2,4\"],\n    \"C1,5\": [\"C1,4\", \"C1,6\", \"C2,5\"],\n    \"C1,6\": [\"C1,5\", \"C1,7\", \"C2,6\"],\n    \"C1,7\": [\"C1,6\", \"C1,8\", \"C2,7\"],\n    \"C1,8\": [\"C1,7\", \"C2,8\"],\n    \"C2,1\": [\"C2,2\", \"C1,1\"],\n    \"C2,2\": [\"C2,1\", \"C2,3\", \"C1,2\"],\n    \"C2,3\": [\"C2,2\", \"C2,4\", \"C1,3\"],\n    \"C2,4\": [\"C2,3\", \"C2,5\", \"C1,4\"],\n    \"C2,5\": [\"C2,4\", \"C2,6\", \"C1,5\"],\n    \"C2,6\": [\"C2,5\", \"C2,7\", \"C1,6\"],\n    \"C2,7\": [\"C2,6\", \"C2,8\", \"C1,7\"],\n    \"C2,8\": [\"C2,7\", \"C1,8\"]\n}\n\n# Function to generate the plan\ndef generate_plan(initial_state, goal_state, adjacency):\n    plan = [initial_state.copy()]\n    current_state = initial_state.copy()\n    \n    # While the current state is not the goal state\n    while current_state != goal_state:\n        for box, current_location in current_state.items():\n            if current_location != goal_state[box]:\n                # Find a valid move for the box\n                for neighbor in adjacency[current_location]:\n                    # Check if the neighbor is not occupied by another box\n                    if neighbor not in current_state.values():\n                        # Move the box to the neighbor\n                        current_state[box] = neighbor\n                        plan.append(current_state.copy())\n                        break\n                break\n    \n    return plan\n\n# Generate the plan\nplan = generate_plan(initial_state, goal_state, adjacency)\nprint(plan)\n```\n\nThis code will generate a sequence of states that move each box from its initial location to its goal location, adhering to the constraints provided.

    "The timeout error suggests that the code took too long to execute, likely due to an inefficient approach or an infinite loop.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are given the following planning problem:\n\nGrid dimensions: 2 x 8\nCells: ['C1,1', 'C1,2', 'C1,3', 'C1,4', 'C1,5', 'C1,6', 'C1,7', 'C1,8', 'C2,1', 'C2,2', 'C2,3', 'C2,4', 'C2,5', 'C2,6', 'C2,7', 'C2,8']\nAdjacency: {\n  \"C1,1\": [\n    \"C1,2\",\n    \"C2,1\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,2\": [\n    \"C1,1\",\n    \"C1,3\",\n    \"C2,2\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,3\": [\n    \"C1,2\",\n    \"C1,4\",\n    \"C2,3\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,4\": [\n    \"C1,3\",\n    \"C1,5\",\n    \"C2,4\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,5\": [\n    \"C1,4\",\n    \"C1,6\",\n    \"C2,5\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,6\": [\n    \"C1,5\",\n    \"C1,7\",\n    \"C2,6\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,7\": [\n    \"C1,6\",\n    \"C1,8\",\n    \"C2,7\"\n  ],\n  \"C1,8\": [\n    \"C1,7\",\n    \"C2,8\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,1\": [\n    \"C2,2\",\n    \"C1,1\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,2\": [\n    \"C2,1\",\n    \"C2,3\",\n    \"C1,2\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,3\": [\n    \"C2,2\",\n    \"C2,4\",\n    \"C1,3\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,4\": [\n    \"C2,3\",\n    \"C2,5\",\n    \"C1,4\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,5\": [\n    \"C2,4\",\n    \"C2,6\",\n    \"C1,5\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,6\": [\n    \"C2,5\",\n    \"C2,7\",\n    \"C1,6\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,7\": [\n    \"C2,6\",\n    \"C2,8\",\n    \"C1,7\"\n  ],\n  \"C2,8\": [\n    \"C2,7\",\n    \"C1,8\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThere is one robot arm in each cell: ['C1,1', 'C1,2', 'C1,3', 'C1,4', 'C1,5', 'C1,6', 'C1,7', 'C1,8', 'C2,1', 'C2,2', 'C2,3', 'C2,4', 'C2,5', 'C2,6', 'C2,7', 'C2,8']\n\nBoxes: ['box1', 'box2', 'box3', 'box4']\nInitial state: {\n  \"box1\": \"C1,4\",\n  \"box2\": \"C2,8\",\n  \"box3\": \"C2,2\",\n  \"box4\": \"C2,1\"\n}\nGoal locations: {\n  \"box1\": \"C2,8\",\n  \"box2\": \"C2,2\",\n  \"box3\": \"C1,2\",\n  \"box4\": \"C2,5\"\n}\n\nTask: Generate a plan as a JSON-formatted list representing the states at successive time steps.\nEach state is a dictionary mapping each box to its current cell location.\nThe plan must satisfy the following:\n  1. The first state equals the initial state.\n  2. The final state equals the goal state (i.e. each box is located in the same cell as its goal).\n  3. Between successive states, a box may either remain in its current cell or move to an adjacent cell (as defined in the adjacency list).\n  4. Each cell contains only one arm. Hence, in each cell at most one box can be moved at a time to the adjacent cell.\n  5. If a box is at its goal cell, no further action needed for this box. Just keeping it at the goal cell.\n  6. Represent each cell state as its current cell location.\n\nIn the end of your answer return a list of states and surround it with <<<>>>, such as\n<<<[{\"box1\": \"C1,2\", \"box2\": \"C2,3\"}, {\"box1\": \"C1,3\", \"box2\": \"C2,3\"}, ...]>>>.\n\nYour answer:\n",
