Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Cat (G) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than Cat (G) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Leopard (D) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than Leopard (D) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Tiger (C) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than Tiger (C) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Elephant (A) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than Elephant (A) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n1. **Round 3 Analysis:**\n   - Since you lost with Tiger (C), the opponent must have played Elephant (A) or Lion (B).\n   - However, in Round 4, you won with Elephant (A), which means the opponent did not have Elephant (A) left to play.\n   - Therefore, in Round 3, the opponent played Lion (B).\n\n2. **Round 2 Analysis:**\n   - You lost with Leopard (D), and the opponent could have played Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n   - Since Lion (B) was used in Round 3, the opponent must have played Tiger (C) in Round 2.\n\n3. **Round 1 Analysis:**\n   - You lost with Cat (G), and the opponent could have played any piece ranked higher than Cat (G).\n   - Since Lion (B) and Tiger (C) were used in Rounds 3 and 2 respectively, the opponent must have played Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Elephant (A) in Round 1.\n   - However, since Elephant (A) was not available in Round 4, the opponent must have played Dog (F) in Round 1.\n\n4. **Round 4 Analysis:**\n   - You won with Elephant (A), meaning the opponent played a piece ranked lower than Elephant (A).\n   - Since Lion (B) and Tiger (C) were already used, the opponent could have played any remaining piece.\n   - The opponent played Mouse (H) in Round 4.\n\nBased on this analysis, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<F,C,B,H>>>"
