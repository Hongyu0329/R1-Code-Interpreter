Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played F (Dog) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than F (Dog).\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played H (Mouse) and it was a draw.\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n- The opponent must have played H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and won.\n- You won, so the opponent must have played a piece smaller than D (Leopard).\n- Possible opponent pieces: E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played A (Elephant) and won.\n- You won, so the opponent must have played a piece smaller than A (Elephant).\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than F (Dog). Since the opponent played H (Mouse) in Round 2, they couldn't have played H in Round 1. The opponent also couldn't have played D (Leopard) in Round 3, so the opponent must have played E (Wolf) in Round 1.\n\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played H (Mouse), as it was a draw.\n\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece smaller than D (Leopard). Since the opponent played H (Mouse) in Round 2, they couldn't have played H in Round 3. The opponent must have played G (Cat) in Round 3.\n\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece smaller than A (Elephant). Since the opponent played E (Wolf) in Round 1, H (Mouse) in Round 2, and G (Cat) in Round 3, the opponent must have played B (Lion) in Round 4.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<E, H, G, B>>>."
