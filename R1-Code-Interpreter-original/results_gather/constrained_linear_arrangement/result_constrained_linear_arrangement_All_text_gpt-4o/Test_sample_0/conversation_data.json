Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules provided.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Metal (D).\n- The result was a draw.\n\nFor a draw to occur, both players must have played the same card. Therefore, the opponent also played Metal (D).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Earth (C).\n- You won the round.\n\nFor you to win, your card must overcome the opponent's card. According to the overcoming rules, Earth (C) overcomes Water (E). Therefore, the opponent played Water (E).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Water (E).\n- You won the round.\n\nFor you to win, your card must overcome the opponent's card. According to the overcoming rules, Water (E) overcomes Fire (B). Therefore, the opponent played Fire (B).\n\nBased on the analysis, the opponent played the following cards in each round:\n\n<<<D, E, B>>>"
