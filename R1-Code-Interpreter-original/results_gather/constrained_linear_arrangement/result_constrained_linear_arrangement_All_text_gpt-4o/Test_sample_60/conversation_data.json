    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Leopard (D) and lost.\n- According to the rules, you lose if the opponent's piece is larger than yours or if the opponent's Mouse (H) captures your Leopard (D).\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Lion (B) and won.\n- You win if your piece is larger than the opponent's piece or if the opponent's Elephant (A) is captured by your Mouse (H), but since you played B, the opponent's piece must be smaller.\n- Possible opponent pieces: C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Tiger (C) and won.\n- You win if your piece is larger than the opponent's piece.\n- Possible opponent pieces: D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- You lose if the opponent's piece is larger than your Mouse (H), which means any piece except the Elephant (A) since the Mouse can capture the Elephant.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent's piece must be larger than D or H. Since you lost, it could be A, B, C, E, F, G, or H. However, since you won in Round 2 with B, the opponent's piece in Round 1 cannot be B. Also, since you won in Round 3 with C, the opponent's piece in Round 1 cannot be C. Therefore, the opponent's piece in Round 1 is A (Elephant).\n\n- **Round 2:** You won with B, so the opponent's piece must be smaller than B. Possible pieces are C, D, E, F, G, or H. Since you won in Round 3 with C, the opponent's piece in Round 2 cannot be C. Therefore, the opponent's piece in Round 2 is D (Leopard).\n\n- **Round 3:** You won with C, so the opponent's piece must be smaller than C. Possible pieces are D, E, F, G, or H. Since D was used in Round 2, the opponent's piece in Round 3 is E (Wolf).\n\n- **Round 4:** You lost with H, so the opponent's piece must be larger than H. Possible pieces are B, C, D, E, F, or G. Since A was used in Round 1, D in Round 2, and E in Round 3, the opponent's piece in Round 4 is B (Lion).\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<A, D, E, B>>>."
