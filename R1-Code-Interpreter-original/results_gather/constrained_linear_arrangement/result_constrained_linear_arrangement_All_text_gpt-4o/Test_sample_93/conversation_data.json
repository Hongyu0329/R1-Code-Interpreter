  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played B (Lion) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than B (Lion) for you to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played E (Wolf) and it was a draw.\n- The opponent must have played the same piece, E (Wolf), for it to be a draw.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played H (Mouse) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece that can capture H (Mouse).\n- Possible opponent pieces: G (Cat), F (Dog).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than D (Leopard).\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played C (Tiger) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than C (Tiger).\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than B (Lion). Since E (Wolf) was used in Round 2, the opponent could have played C (Tiger), D (Leopard), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played E (Wolf).\n\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece that can capture H (Mouse). Since G (Cat) and F (Dog) are the only pieces that can capture H (Mouse), and F (Dog) was not used in Round 1, the opponent played F (Dog).\n\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece larger than D (Leopard). Since B (Lion) was not used in Round 1, the opponent played B (Lion).\n\n5. **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece larger than C (Tiger). Since A (Elephant) was not used in previous rounds, the opponent played A (Elephant).\n\nBased on the analysis, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<C, E, F, B, A>>>"
