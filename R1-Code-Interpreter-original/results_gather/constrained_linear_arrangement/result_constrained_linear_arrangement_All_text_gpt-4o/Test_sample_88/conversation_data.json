Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played B (Lion) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than B (Lion) for you to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played G (Cat) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than G (Cat) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played H (Mouse) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than H (Mouse) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played F (Dog) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than F (Dog) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played C (Tiger) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than C (Tiger) for you to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than B (Lion). Since you won, the opponent could have played C, D, E, F, G, or H. However, since you lost in Round 2 with G, the opponent must have played a piece larger than G in Round 2. Therefore, the opponent could not have played G in Round 1. The opponent could have played C, D, E, F, or H.\n\n- **Round 2:** You lost with G (Cat), so the opponent played a piece larger than G. Possible pieces are A, B, C, D, E, or F. Since you lost in Round 3 with H, the opponent must have played a piece larger than H in Round 3. Therefore, the opponent could not have played H in Round 2. The opponent could have played A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n\n- **Round 3:** You lost with H (Mouse), so the opponent played a piece larger than H. Possible pieces are B, C, D, E, or F. Since you lost in Round 4 with F, the opponent must have played a piece larger than F in Round 4. Therefore, the opponent could not have played F in Round 3. The opponent could have played B, C, D, or E.\n\n- **Round 4:** You lost with F (Dog), so the opponent played a piece larger than F. Possible pieces are A, B, C, D, or E. Since you won in Round 5 with C, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than C in Round 5. Therefore, the opponent could not have played C in Round 4. The opponent could have played A, B, D, or E.\n\n- **Round 5:** You won with C (Tiger), so the opponent played a piece smaller than C. Possible pieces are D, E, F, G, or H. Since the opponent could not have played F in Round 3, the opponent could have played D, E, G, or H.\n\nBy process of elimination and considering the outcomes of each round, we can deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played E (Wolf).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played A (Elephant).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played B (Lion).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played D (Leopard).\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played G (Cat).\n\nTherefore, the list of the opponent's pieces is: <<<E, A, B, D, G>>>."
