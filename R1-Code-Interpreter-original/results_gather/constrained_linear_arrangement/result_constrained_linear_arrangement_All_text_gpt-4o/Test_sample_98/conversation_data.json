  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played F (Dog) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than F (Dog) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played E (Wolf) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than E (Wolf) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than D (Leopard) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played C (Tiger) and it was a draw.\n- The opponent must have played the same piece, C (Tiger).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played A (Elephant) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than A (Elephant) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than F (Dog) and smaller than E (Wolf) since they lost in Round 3. Possible pieces: D (Leopard).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece larger than E (Wolf) and smaller than D (Leopard) since they lost in Round 3. Possible pieces: C (Tiger).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece smaller than D (Leopard). Possible pieces: E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played C (Tiger) since it was a draw.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece smaller than A (Elephant). Possible pieces: B (Lion), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\nConsidering the above deductions and the fact that each piece can only be used once, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n- **Round 1:** D (Leopard)\n- **Round 2:** B (Lion)\n- **Round 3:** E (Wolf)\n- **Round 4:** C (Tiger)\n- **Round 5:** H (Mouse)\n\nTherefore, the list of opponent's pieces is: <<<D, B, E, C, H>>>."
