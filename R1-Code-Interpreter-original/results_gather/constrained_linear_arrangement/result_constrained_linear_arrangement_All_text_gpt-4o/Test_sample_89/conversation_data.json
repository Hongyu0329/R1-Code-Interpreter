  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1: A, draw.**\n   - You played Elephant (A).\n   - The result was a draw, which means the opponent also played an Elephant (A).\n\n2. **Round 2: F, loss.**\n   - You played Dog (F).\n   - You lost, which means the opponent played a piece ranked higher than Dog (F). The possible pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n3. **Round 3: D, loss.**\n   - You played Leopard (D).\n   - You lost, which means the opponent played a piece ranked higher than Leopard (D). The possible pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n\n4. **Round 4: C, win.**\n   - You played Tiger (C).\n   - You won, which means the opponent played a piece ranked lower than Tiger (C). The possible pieces are Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n5. **Round 5: H, loss.**\n   - You played Mouse (H).\n   - You lost, which means the opponent played a piece ranked higher than Mouse (H). The possible pieces are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G). However, since Mouse can capture Elephant, the opponent did not play Elephant (A).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- From Round 1, we know the opponent played A.\n- From Round 2, the opponent played a piece higher than F. Since A is already used, the opponent could have played B, C, D, or E.\n- From Round 3, the opponent played a piece higher than D. Since A is already used, the opponent could have played B or C.\n- From Round 4, the opponent played a piece lower than C. The possible pieces are D, E, F, G, or H.\n- From Round 5, the opponent played a piece higher than H. The possible pieces are B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce:\n\n- Round 1: A\n- Round 2: E (since E is higher than F and not used in other rounds)\n- Round 3: B (since B is higher than D and not used in other rounds)\n- Round 4: G (since G is lower than C and not used in other rounds)\n- Round 5: C (since C is higher than H and not used in other rounds)\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<A, E, B, G, C>>>."
