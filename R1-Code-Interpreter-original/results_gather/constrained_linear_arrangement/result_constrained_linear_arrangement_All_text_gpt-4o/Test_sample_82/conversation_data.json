  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, win.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: A, loss.\nRound 4: B, win.\nRound 5: E, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze each round based on the rules of generation and overcoming.\n\n**Round 1: You played D (Metal), and you won.**\n- Metal D overcomes Wood A. Therefore, the opponent must have played A (Wood).\n\n**Round 2: You played C (Earth), and it was a draw.**\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played C (Earth).\n\n**Round 3: You played A (Wood), and you lost.**\n- You lose when your card generates the opponent's card. Wood A generates Fire B. Therefore, the opponent must have played B (Fire).\n\n**Round 4: You played B (Fire), and you won.**\n- Fire B overcomes Metal D. Therefore, the opponent must have played D (Metal).\n\n**Round 5: You played E (Water), and it was a draw.**\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played E (Water).\n\nBased on the analysis, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n<<<A, C, B, D, E>>>"
