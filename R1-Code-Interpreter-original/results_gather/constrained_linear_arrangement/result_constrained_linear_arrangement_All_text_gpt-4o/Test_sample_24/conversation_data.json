  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, win.\nRound 2: B, win.\nRound 3: C, win.\nRound 4: A, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Worm), and you won.**\n   - Worm beats Stick (A).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Stick (A).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played B (Tiger), and you won.**\n   - Tiger beats Chicken (C).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played C (Chicken), and you won.**\n   - Chicken beats Worm (D).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Worm (D).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played A (Stick), and you won.**\n   - Stick beats Tiger (B).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n\nBased on the analysis of each round, the opponent played the following cards:\n\n<<<A, C, D, B>>>"
