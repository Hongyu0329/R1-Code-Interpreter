  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: H, loss.\nRound 2: F, loss.\nRound 3: E, loss.\nRound 4: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- According to the rules, the Mouse can only lose to the Cat (G) or Dog (F) or any larger piece, except the Elephant (A) which it can capture.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played either G, F, E, D, C, B, or A.\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Dog (F) and lost.\n- The Dog can lose to any piece ranked higher than it: E, D, C, B, or A.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played either E, D, C, B, or A.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Wolf (E) and lost.\n- The Wolf can lose to any piece ranked higher than it: D, C, B, or A.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played either D, C, B, or A.\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Tiger (C) and lost.\n- The Tiger can lose to any piece ranked higher than it: B or A.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played either B or A.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces by considering the possible options for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played G, F, E, D, C, B, or A.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent could have played E, D, C, B, or A.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played D, C, B, or A.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent could have played B or A.\n\nSince each piece can only be used once, we need to find a combination that fits all rounds:\n\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played B (Lion) or A (Elephant). Let's assume B (Lion) for now.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played D (Leopard) or A (Elephant). Since B (Lion) is used in Round 4, let's assume D (Leopard) for Round 3.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent could have played E (Wolf), C (Tiger), or A (Elephant). Since D (Leopard) is used in Round 3, let's assume E (Wolf) for Round 2.\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played G (Cat), F (Dog), or A (Elephant). Since E (Wolf) is used in Round 2, let's assume A (Elephant) for Round 1.\n\nThis combination satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Round 1: You played H, opponent played A (Elephant).\n- Round 2: You played F, opponent played E (Wolf).\n- Round 3: You played E, opponent played D (Leopard).\n- Round 4: You played C, opponent played B (Lion).\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<A, E, D, B>>>."
