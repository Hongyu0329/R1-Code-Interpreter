  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, draw.\nRound 2: B, draw.\nRound 3: C, loss.\nRound 4: D, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results provided.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: A (Stick)\n- Result: Draw\n\nFor a draw to occur, the opponent must have played the same card as you or a card that is one step apart in the cycle. The cards that can result in a draw with Stick (A) are:\n- Stick (A)\n- Worm (D) (since Worm beats Stick, but in a draw scenario, it is considered one step apart)\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: B (Tiger)\n- Result: Draw\n\nFor a draw to occur, the opponent must have played the same card as you or a card that is one step apart in the cycle. The cards that can result in a draw with Tiger (B) are:\n- Tiger (B)\n- Stick (A) (since Stick beats Tiger, but in a draw scenario, it is considered one step apart)\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: C (Chicken)\n- Result: Loss\n\nFor you to lose, the opponent must have played a card that beats Chicken. The card that beats Chicken (C) is:\n- Tiger (B)\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: D (Worm)\n- Result: Win\n\nFor you to win, the opponent must have played a card that is beaten by Worm. The card that is beaten by Worm (D) is:\n- Stick (A)\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards based on the above analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent could have played A or D. Since you won in Round 4 with D against A, the opponent must have played D in Round 1.\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent could have played A or B. Since the opponent played D in Round 1, they couldn't have played A in Round 2 (as each card can only be used once). Therefore, the opponent must have played B in Round 2.\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played B, as it beats C.\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played A, as you won with D against A.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n<<<D, A, B, A>>>"
