  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: D, draw.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played C (Chicken), and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n   - The cycle is: Stick (A) -> Tiger (B) -> Chicken (C) -> Worm (D) -> Stick (A).\n   - Since you played C, the opponent must have played C as well for it to be a draw.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played A (Stick), and it was a draw.**\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played A as well.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played D (Worm), and it was a draw.**\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played D as well.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played B (Tiger), and it was a draw.**\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played B as well.\n\nSince all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent played the same card as you in each round.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards for each round were: <<<C, A, D, B>>>."
