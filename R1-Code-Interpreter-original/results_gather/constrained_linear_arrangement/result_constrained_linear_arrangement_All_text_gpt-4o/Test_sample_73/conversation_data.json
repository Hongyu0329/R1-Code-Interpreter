  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: A, loss.\nRound 3: E, draw.\nRound 4: C, win.\nRound 5: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules of generation and overcoming. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played B (Fire), result is a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card or when no card generates or overcomes the other.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played B (Fire).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played A (Wood), result is a loss.**\n   - You lose when your card generates the opponent's card.\n   - Wood A generates Fire B.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played B (Fire).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played E (Water), result is a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card or when no card generates or overcomes the other.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played E (Water).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played C (Earth), result is a win.**\n   - You win when your card overcomes the opponent's card.\n   - Earth C overcomes Water E.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played E (Water).\n\n5. **Round 5: You played D (Metal), result is a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card or when no card generates or overcomes the other.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played D (Metal).\n\nNow, let's list the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: B\n- Round 3: E\n- Round 4: E\n- Round 5: D\n\nThe opponent's cards for each round are: <<<B, B, E, E, D>>>."
