  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: E, loss.\nRound 2: D, draw.\nRound 3: A, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules of generation and overcoming.\n\n**Round 1: You played Earth (E) and lost.**\n- According to the rules, you lose if your card generates the opponent's card. Earth (E) generates Metal (D). Therefore, the opponent must have played Metal (D).\n\n**Round 2: You played Metal (D) and it was a draw.**\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same card or when no card generates or overcomes the other. Since you played Metal (D) and it was a draw, the opponent must have also played Metal (D).\n\n**Round 3: You played Wood (A) and it was a draw.**\n- Similar to Round 2, a draw means both players played the same card or no card generates or overcomes the other. Since you played Wood (A) and it was a draw, the opponent must have also played Wood (A).\n\nBased on this analysis, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n<<<D, D, A>>>"
