  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: B, draw.\nRound 3: A, draw.\nRound 4: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the rules and the results of each round step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Rules:**\n   - Stick (A) beats Tiger (B)\n   - Tiger (B) beats Chicken (C)\n   - Chicken (C) beats Worm (D)\n   - Worm (D) beats Stick (A)\n   - If both players play the same card, it's a draw.\n   - If cards are one step apart in the cycle, it's a draw.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Round:**\n\n   - **Round 1: You played C, and it was a draw.**\n     - A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart.\n     - Possible cards for the opponent: C (same card) or D (one step apart from C).\n\n   - **Round 2: You played B, and it was a draw.**\n     - Possible cards for the opponent: B (same card) or A (one step apart from B).\n\n   - **Round 3: You played A, and it was a draw.**\n     - Possible cards for the opponent: A (same card) or D (one step apart from A).\n\n   - **Round 4: You played D, and it was a draw.**\n     - Possible cards for the opponent: D (same card) or C (one step apart from D).\n\n3. **Deducing the Opponent's Cards:**\n   - We need to ensure that each card is used exactly once by the opponent, just like you.\n   - From the analysis:\n     - Round 1: Opponent could have played C or D.\n     - Round 2: Opponent could have played B or A.\n     - Round 3: Opponent could have played A or D.\n     - Round 4: Opponent could have played D or C.\n\n   - By process of elimination and ensuring each card is used once:\n     - Round 1: Opponent played C.\n     - Round 2: Opponent played B.\n     - Round 3: Opponent played A.\n     - Round 4: Opponent played D.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are: <<<C, B, A, D>>>."
