  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, draw.\nRound 2: B, draw.\nRound 3: C, draw.\nRound 4: D, draw.\nRound 5: E, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the cards played by the opponent in each round based on the cards we played and the results. We know that each round resulted in a draw, which means both players played the same card or the cards neither generated nor overcame each other.\n\nLet's analyze each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1: A, draw.**\n   - We played Wood (A).\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played Wood (A) as well.\n\n2. **Round 2: B, draw.**\n   - We played Fire (B).\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played Fire (B) as well.\n\n3. **Round 3: C, draw.**\n   - We played Earth (C).\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played Earth (C) as well.\n\n4. **Round 4: D, draw.**\n   - We played Metal (D).\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played Metal (D) as well.\n\n5. **Round 5: E, draw.**\n   - We played Water (E).\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played Water (E) as well.\n\nSince all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent played the same cards as we did in each round.\n\nTherefore, the cards played by the opponent in each round are: <<<A, B, C, D, E>>>."
