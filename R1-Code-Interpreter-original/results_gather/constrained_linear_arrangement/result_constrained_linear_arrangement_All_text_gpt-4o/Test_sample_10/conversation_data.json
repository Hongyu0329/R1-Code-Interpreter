    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round step by step according to the rules of the game.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Cat (G)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- Since you lost with a Cat (G), the opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than a Cat. The possible pieces that could have defeated your Cat are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Dog (F).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Lion (B)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- Since you lost with a Lion (B), the opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than a Lion. The possible pieces that could have defeated your Lion are Elephant (A).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Wolf (E)\n- Result: Win\n\nAnalysis:\n- Since you won with a Wolf (E), the opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than a Wolf. The possible pieces that could have been defeated by your Wolf are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Combining the Analysis:**\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - Opponent's possible pieces: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - Opponent's possible piece: A\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - Opponent's possible pieces: F, G, H\n\nFrom Round 2, we know the opponent played an Elephant (A) because it is the only piece that can defeat a Lion (B). \n\nFrom Round 3, since you won with a Wolf (E), the opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than a Wolf, which are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nSince the opponent played an Elephant (A) in Round 2, they could not have played it in Round 1. Therefore, in Round 1, the opponent must have played a piece that is higher than a Cat (G) but not an Elephant (A). The possible pieces are B, C, D, E, or F.\n\nConsidering the opponent's piece in Round 3 was lower than a Wolf (E), and they have already used an Elephant (A) in Round 2, the only consistent piece for Round 1 that is higher than a Cat (G) and not an Elephant (A) is Dog (F).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n- Round 1: F\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: G or H\n\nSince the opponent's piece in Round 3 must be lower than a Wolf (E), and they have already used Dog (F) in Round 1, the only remaining piece is Mouse (H).\n\nFinal Answer: <<<F, A, H>>>"
