The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes provided.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- According to the rules, the Mouse can only lose to the Cat (G) or Dog (F) because it can capture the Elephant (A) and draws with another Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played either Cat (G) or Dog (F).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Dog (F) and it was a draw.\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Dog (F).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Tiger (C) and won.\n- The Tiger can win against Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- The opponent cannot have played Elephant (A), Lion (B), or another Tiger (C) because those would result in a loss or draw.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Elephant (A) and won.\n- The Elephant can win against Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), and Cat (G).\n- The opponent cannot have played another Elephant (A) or Mouse (H) because those would result in a draw or loss.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played Wolf (E) and won.\n- The Wolf can win against Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- The opponent cannot have played Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or another Wolf (E) because those would result in a loss or draw.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played Cat (G) or Dog (F). Since Dog (F) was used in Round 2, the opponent must have played Cat (G) in Round 1.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Dog (F).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Cat (G), or Mouse (H). Since Cat (G) was used in Round 1, the opponent must have played Leopard (D) or Mouse (H). However, since Mouse (H) would lose to Tiger (C), the opponent must have played Leopard (D).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G). Since Leopard (D) was used in Round 3, Dog (F) in Round 2, and Cat (G) in Round 1, the opponent must have played Lion (B).\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H). Since Dog (F) was used in Round 2 and Cat (G) in Round 1, the opponent must have played Mouse (H).\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<G, F, D, B, H>>>."
