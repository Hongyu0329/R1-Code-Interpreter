  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, win.\nRound 2: C, win.\nRound 3: D, loss.\nRound 4: G, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step, considering the rules of the game.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Elephant (A)\n- Result: Win\n\nSince you won with the Elephant, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Elephant. The only piece that can defeat the Elephant is the Mouse (H), but since you won, the opponent did not play the Mouse. Therefore, the opponent played one of the pieces B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Tiger (C)\n- Result: Win\n\nSince you won with the Tiger, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Tiger. The Tiger can defeat pieces D, E, F, G, and H. Therefore, the opponent played one of the pieces D, E, F, G, or H.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Leopard (D)\n- Result: Loss\n\nSince you lost with the Leopard, the opponent must have played a piece larger than the Leopard. The Leopard can be defeated by pieces A, B, or C. Therefore, the opponent played one of the pieces A, B, or C.\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Cat (G)\n- Result: Loss\n\nSince you lost with the Cat, the opponent must have played a piece larger than the Cat. The Cat can be defeated by pieces A, B, C, D, E, or F. Therefore, the opponent played one of the pieces A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than A, which could be B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece smaller than C, which could be D, E, F, G, or H.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece larger than D, which could be A, B, or C.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece larger than G, which could be A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n\nConsidering the constraints from all rounds:\n- In Round 1, the opponent could not have played H (since you won with A), and in Round 2, the opponent could not have played A, B, or C (since you won with C). Therefore, the opponent played D, E, F, or G in Round 1.\n- In Round 2, the opponent could not have played A, B, or C (since you won with C), and in Round 3, the opponent played A, B, or C. Therefore, the opponent played D, E, F, or G in Round 2.\n- In Round 3, the opponent played A, B, or C.\n- In Round 4, the opponent played a piece larger than G, which could be A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n\nBy elimination and considering the rules:\n- The opponent played G in Round 1 (since G is smaller than A and could be played in Round 1).\n- The opponent played H in Round 2 (since H is smaller than C and could be played in Round 2).\n- The opponent played B in Round 3 (since B is larger than D and could be played in Round 3).\n- The opponent played F in Round 4 (since F is larger than G and could be played in Round 4).\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<G, H, B, F>>>."
