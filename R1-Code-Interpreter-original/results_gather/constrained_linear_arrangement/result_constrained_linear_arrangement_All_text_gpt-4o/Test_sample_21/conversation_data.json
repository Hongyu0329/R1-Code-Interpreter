  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: D, loss.\nRound 4: C, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze each round based on the rules provided and the outcomes.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played card B (Tiger).\n- The result was a draw.\n- A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n- Since you played B, the opponent could have played B (same card) or C (one step apart in the cycle: Tiger eats Chicken).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played card A (Stick).\n- The result was a draw.\n- A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n- Since you played A, the opponent could have played A (same card) or D (one step apart in the cycle: Worm beats Stick).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played card D (Worm).\n- The result was a loss.\n- You lose if the opponent's card beats yours.\n- Since you played D, the opponent must have played C (Chicken eats Worm).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played card C (Chicken).\n- The result was a win.\n- You win if your card beats the opponent's card.\n- Since you played C, the opponent must have played D (Chicken eats Worm).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- In Round 3, the opponent played C.\n- In Round 4, the opponent played D.\n\nSince each card can only be used once, we can use this information to deduce the remaining cards for Rounds 1 and 2:\n\n- In Round 1, the opponent could have played B or C. Since C was used in Round 3, the opponent must have played B.\n- In Round 2, the opponent could have played A or D. Since D was used in Round 4, the opponent must have played A.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n<<<B, A, C, D>>>"
