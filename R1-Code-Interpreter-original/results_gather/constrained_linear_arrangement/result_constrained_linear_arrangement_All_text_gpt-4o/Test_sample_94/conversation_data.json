    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played G (Cat), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than G (Cat) to win.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played F (Dog), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than F (Dog) to win.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played B (Lion), and you won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than B (Lion) to lose.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played D (Leopard), and it was a draw.**\n   - The opponent must have played the same piece, D (Leopard), for the result to be a draw.\n\n5. **Round 5: You played H (Mouse), and it was a draw.**\n   - The opponent must have played the same piece, H (Mouse), for the result to be a draw.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- From Round 4, we know the opponent played D (Leopard).\n- From Round 5, we know the opponent played H (Mouse).\n- In Round 3, since you won with B (Lion), the opponent must have played a piece lower than B (Lion) and not D (Leopard) or H (Mouse). Possible pieces are C (Tiger), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n- In Round 1, the opponent played a piece higher than G (Cat) and not D (Leopard) or H (Mouse). Possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), E (Wolf).\n- In Round 2, the opponent played a piece higher than F (Dog) and not D (Leopard) or H (Mouse). Possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger).\n\nConsidering the constraints and the need to use each piece only once, we can deduce:\n\n- Round 1: The opponent played E (Wolf) to win against G (Cat).\n- Round 2: The opponent played A (Elephant) to win against F (Dog).\n- Round 3: The opponent played C (Tiger) and lost to B (Lion).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<E, A, C, D, H>>>."
