  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, loss.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: D, draw.\nRound 4: B, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Stick (A)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAccording to the rules, Stick (A) loses to Worm (D). Therefore, the opponent must have played Worm (D).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Chicken (C)\n- Result: Draw\n\nA draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Worm (D)\n- Result: Draw\n\nAgain, a draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played Worm (D).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Tiger (B)\n- Result: Win\n\nTiger (B) wins against Chicken (C). Therefore, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: D\n- Round 4: C\n\nHowever, we notice that the opponent cannot play the same card twice in different rounds. Let's re-evaluate the rounds with this constraint:\n\n**Re-evaluation:**\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Stick (A)\n- Result: Loss\n- Opponent played: Worm (D)\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Chicken (C)\n- Result: Draw\n- Opponent played: Chicken (C)\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Worm (D)\n- Result: Draw\n- Opponent played: Worm (D)\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Tiger (B)\n- Result: Win\n- Opponent played: Stick (A)\n\nThe opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n<<<D, C, A, C>>>"
