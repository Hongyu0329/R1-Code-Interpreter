  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: A, win.\nRound 3: D, loss.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules of the game and the cards played by you.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Chicken (C)\n- Result: Draw\n\nFor a draw to occur, the opponent must have played the same card as you or a card that is one step apart in the cycle. The cards that can result in a draw with Chicken (C) are Chicken (C) itself or Worm (D) (since Chicken eats Worm, and Worm beats Stick, which is one step apart from Chicken).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Stick (A)\n- Result: Win\n\nFor you to win, your opponent must have played a card that Stick beats. According to the rules, Stick beats Tiger (B). Therefore, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Worm (D)\n- Result: Loss\n\nFor you to lose, your opponent must have played a card that beats Worm. According to the rules, Chicken (C) eats Worm. Therefore, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Tiger (B)\n- Result: Draw\n\nFor a draw to occur, the opponent must have played the same card as you or a card that is one step apart in the cycle. The cards that can result in a draw with Tiger (B) are Tiger (B) itself or Stick (A) (since Stick beats Tiger, and Tiger eats Chicken, which is one step apart from Tiger).\n\nNow, let's summarize the possible cards the opponent played in each round:\n\n- Round 1: C or D\n- Round 2: B\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: B or A\n\nConsidering the cards used and the results, we can deduce the following:\n\n- In Round 1, the opponent played D (since C is used in Round 3).\n- In Round 4, the opponent played A (since B is used in Round 2).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n<<<D, B, C, A>>>"
