  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: A, loss.\nRound 3: C, draw.\nRound 4: D, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played B (Tiger).\n- Result: Draw.\n- Possible opponent cards: B (Tiger).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played A (Stick).\n- Result: Loss.\n- Stick loses to Worm (D).\n- Opponent card: D (Worm).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played C (Chicken).\n- Result: Draw.\n- Possible opponent cards: C (Chicken).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played D (Worm).\n- Result: Loss.\n- Worm loses to Chicken (C).\n- Opponent card: C (Chicken).\n\nNow, let's verify the opponent's card choices:\n\n1. Round 1: Opponent played B (Tiger) - Draw with your B.\n2. Round 2: Opponent played D (Worm) - You lost with A.\n3. Round 3: Opponent played C (Chicken) - Draw with your C.\n4. Round 4: Opponent played C (Chicken) - You lost with D.\n\nThe opponent's cards for each round are:\n<<<B, D, C, C>>>"
