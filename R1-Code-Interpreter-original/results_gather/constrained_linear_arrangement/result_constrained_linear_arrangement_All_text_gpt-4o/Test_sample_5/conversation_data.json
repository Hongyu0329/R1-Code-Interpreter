The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules provided and the cards you played.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: A (Elephant)\n- Result: Win\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Elephant (A) is the largest piece, and it can only be captured by a Mouse (H) due to the special rule.\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Elephant, but not a Mouse, because a Mouse would have captured your Elephant.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: G (Cat)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Cat (G) is a smaller piece, and it can be captured by any piece larger than it.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than a Cat.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: F (Dog)\n- Result: Draw\n\nAnalysis:\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same type of piece.\n- Since the result was a draw, the opponent must have also played a Dog (F).\n\nBased on the analysis, we can deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat)\n- Round 2: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), or F (Dog)\n- Round 3: F (Dog)\n\nTo narrow down the possibilities, consider the following:\n- In Round 1, the opponent could not have played F (Dog) because they played it in Round 3.\n- In Round 2, the opponent could not have played F (Dog) because they played it in Round 3.\n\nThus, the most likely sequence of opponent's pieces is:\n- Round 1: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), or G (Cat)\n- Round 2: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), or E (Wolf)\n- Round 3: F (Dog)\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to use each piece only once, a plausible sequence is:\n- Round 1: E (Wolf)\n- Round 2: A (Elephant)\n- Round 3: F (Dog)\n\nFinal answer: <<<E, A, F>>>"
