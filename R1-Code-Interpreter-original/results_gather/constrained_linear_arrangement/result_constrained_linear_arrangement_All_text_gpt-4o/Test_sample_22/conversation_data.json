  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, loss.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, draw.\nRound 4: D, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results provided.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Chicken (C)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAccording to the rules:\n- Chicken (C) loses to Tiger (B) because Tiger eats Chicken.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Stick (A)\n- Result: Draw\n\nAccording to the rules:\n- A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n- Stick (A) draws with Stick (A) or Worm (D) because Worm beats Stick.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Stick (A) or Worm (D).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Tiger (B)\n- Result: Draw\n\nAccording to the rules:\n- A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n- Tiger (B) draws with Tiger (B) or Chicken (C) because Tiger eats Chicken.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Tiger (B) or Chicken (C).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Worm (D)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAccording to the rules:\n- Worm (D) loses to Chicken (C) because Chicken eats Worm.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards based on the constraints:\n- From Round 1, the opponent played Tiger (B).\n- From Round 4, the opponent played Chicken (C).\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played Stick (A) or Worm (D).\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played Tiger (B) or Chicken (C).\n\nSince the opponent has only one of each card, we can deduce:\n- In Round 2, the opponent must have played Stick (A) because they played Chicken (C) in Round 4.\n- In Round 3, the opponent must have played Tiger (B) because they played Chicken (C) in Round 4.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: C\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B, A, B, C>>>"
