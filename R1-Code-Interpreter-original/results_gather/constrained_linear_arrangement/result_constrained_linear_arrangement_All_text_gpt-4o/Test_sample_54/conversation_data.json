Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Leopard (D) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than Leopard (D).\n- Possible opponent pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- According to the rules, the Mouse can only be captured by Cat (G) or another Mouse (H) since it can capture the Elephant (A).\n- Possible opponent pieces: Cat (G), Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Elephant (A) and lost.\n- The only piece that can capture the Elephant (A) is the Mouse (H).\n- Opponent piece: Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Wolf (E) and the result was a draw.\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n- Opponent piece: Wolf (E).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played either Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Cat (G) or Mouse (H).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Mouse (H).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Wolf (E).\n\nSince the opponent played Mouse (H) in Round 3, they could not have played Mouse (H) in Round 2. Therefore, in Round 2, the opponent must have played Cat (G).\n\nFor Round 1, since the opponent has already used Mouse (H) and Cat (G), the remaining higher-ranked pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), and Tiger (C). Since the opponent played Wolf (E) in Round 4, they could not have played it in Round 1. Therefore, the opponent must have played either Lion (B) or Tiger (C) in Round 1.\n\nConsidering the rules and the pieces used, the most logical deduction is:\n\n- **Round 1:** Tiger (C)\n- **Round 2:** Cat (G)\n- **Round 3:** Mouse (H)\n- **Round 4:** Wolf (E)\n\nThus, the list of opponent's pieces is: <<<C,G,H,E>>>."
