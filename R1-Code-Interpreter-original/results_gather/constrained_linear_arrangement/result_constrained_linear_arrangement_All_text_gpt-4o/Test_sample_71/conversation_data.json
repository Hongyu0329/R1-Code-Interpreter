  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: B, draw.\nRound 4: A, draw.\nRound 5: E, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent, we need to analyze each round based on the rules provided and the results of each round.\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played Metal (D).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Since it's a draw, the opponent must have also played Metal (D).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played Earth (C).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Since it's a draw, the opponent must have also played Earth (C).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played Fire (B).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Since it's a draw, the opponent must have also played Fire (B).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played Wood (A).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Since it's a draw, the opponent must have also played Wood (A).\n\n5. **Round 5:**\n   - You played Water (E).\n   - Result: Loss.\n   - According to the rules, you lose if your card is generated by the opponent's card. Water (E) is generated by Metal (D).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Metal (D).\n\nBased on the analysis, the opponent played the following cards in each round:\n\n<<<D, C, B, A, D>>>"
