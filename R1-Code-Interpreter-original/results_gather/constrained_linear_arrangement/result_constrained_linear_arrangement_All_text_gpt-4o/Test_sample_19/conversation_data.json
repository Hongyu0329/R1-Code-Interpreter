  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, draw.\nRound 2: D, draw.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules of the game and the cards played by you.\n\n### Round Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards for a draw: Stick (A) or Worm (D) (since Worm beats Stick, but in a draw, it means the opponent also played Stick or a card that results in a draw with Stick).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards for a draw: Worm (D) or Chicken (C) (since Chicken eats Worm, but in a draw, it means the opponent also played Worm or a card that results in a draw with Worm).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards for a loss: Stick (A) (since Stick beats Tiger).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards for a loss: Tiger (B) (since Tiger eats Chicken).\n\n### Deduction:\n\n- From Round 3, we know the opponent played Stick (A) because you lost with Tiger (B).\n- From Round 4, we know the opponent played Tiger (B) because you lost with Chicken (C).\n- In Round 1, the opponent could have played Stick (A) or Worm (D) for a draw. Since Stick (A) was used in Round 3, the opponent must have played Worm (D) in Round 1.\n- In Round 2, the opponent could have played Worm (D) or Chicken (C) for a draw. Since Worm (D) was used in Round 1, the opponent must have played Chicken (C) in Round 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe opponent played the following cards in each round:\n- Round 1: Worm (D)\n- Round 2: Chicken (C)\n- Round 3: Stick (A)\n- Round 4: Tiger (B)\n\nFinal answer: <<<D,C,A,B>>>"
