    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1: E, win.**\n   - You played Wolf (E) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Wolf (E), which are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2: C, draw.**\n   - You played Tiger (C) and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played Tiger (C).\n\n3. **Round 3: D, win.**\n   - You played Leopard (D) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), which are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: B, win.**\n   - You played Lion (B) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Lion (B), which are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n5. **Round 5: H, loss.**\n   - You played Mouse (H) and lost. According to the rules, the only piece that can capture Mouse (H) is Cat (G), since Mouse (H) can capture Elephant (A) and draw with another Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- From Round 5, we know the opponent played Cat (G).\n- From Round 2, the opponent played Tiger (C).\n- In Round 1, the opponent played a piece smaller than Wolf (E), and since Cat (G) is already used in Round 5, the opponent could have played Dog (F) or Mouse (H).\n- In Round 3, the opponent played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), and since Cat (G) is already used in Round 5, the opponent could have played Dog (F) or Mouse (H).\n- In Round 4, the opponent played a piece smaller than Lion (B), and since Cat (G) is already used in Round 5, the opponent could have played Dog (F) or Mouse (H).\n\nConsidering the available pieces and the results, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n- Round 1: F (Dog)\n- Round 2: C (Tiger)\n- Round 3: E (Wolf)\n- Round 4: D (Leopard)\n- Round 5: G (Cat)\n\nTherefore, the list of the opponent's pieces is: <<<F,C,E,D,G>>>."
