    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round step by step, considering the rules of the game.\n\n**Round 1: F, win.**\n- You played Dog (F) and won. \n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Dog (F), which are Cat (G) or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 2: A, win.**\n- You played Elephant (A) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A), which are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H). However, since Mouse (H) can capture Elephant (A), the opponent did not play Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 3: C, draw.**\n- You played Tiger (C) and the result was a draw.\n- The opponent must have played Tiger (C) as well, since mutual capture occurs when pieces of the same type encounter each other.\n\n**Round 4: H, loss.**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than Mouse (H), which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played Cat (G) or Mouse (H). Since Mouse (H) was played in Round 4, the opponent played Cat (G) in Round 1.\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G). Since Cat (G) was used in Round 1 and Tiger (C) was used in Round 3, the opponent played Lion (B), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Dog (F). However, since the opponent lost, they must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A) but larger than Mouse (H), which are Lion (B), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Dog (F).\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played Tiger (C).\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece larger than Mouse (H), which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G). Since Cat (G) was used in Round 1 and Tiger (C) was used in Round 3, the opponent played Elephant (A), Lion (B), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Dog (F).\n\nConsidering the possible pieces for each round and the fact that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** G\n- **Round 2:** B\n- **Round 3:** C\n- **Round 4:** A\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<G, B, C, A>>>."
