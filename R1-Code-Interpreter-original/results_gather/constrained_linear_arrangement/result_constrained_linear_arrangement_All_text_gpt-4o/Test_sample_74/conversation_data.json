  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: E, draw.\nRound 3: A, draw.\nRound 4: B, draw.\nRound 5: C, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the cards played by the opponent in each round based on the cards we played and the results. Since all rounds ended in a draw, the opponent must have played the same card as us in each round. Let's analyze each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played card D (Metal).\n   - The result was a draw.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played card D (Metal).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played card E (Water).\n   - The result was a draw.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played card E (Water).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played card A (Wood).\n   - The result was a draw.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played card A (Wood).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played card B (Fire).\n   - The result was a draw.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played card B (Fire).\n\n5. **Round 5:**\n   - We played card C (Earth).\n   - The result was a draw.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played card C (Earth).\n\nSince all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent played the same card as us in each round. Therefore, the list of cards played by the opponent is:\n\n<<<D, E, A, B, C>>>"
