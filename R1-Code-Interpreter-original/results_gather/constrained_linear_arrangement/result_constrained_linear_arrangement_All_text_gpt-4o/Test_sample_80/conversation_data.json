  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: D, win.\nRound 3: B, draw.\nRound 4: A, draw.\nRound 5: E, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent, we need to analyze each round based on the rules provided and the results of each round.\n\n### Round Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played Earth (C), and the result was a draw.\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played the same card, Earth (C).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played Metal (D), and you won.\n   - According to the overcoming rule, Metal (D) overcomes Wood (A).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Wood (A).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played Fire (B), and the result was a draw.\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played the same card, Fire (B).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played Wood (A), and the result was a draw.\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played the same card, Wood (A).\n\n5. **Round 5:**\n   - You played Water (E), and the result was a draw.\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played the same card, Water (E).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of each round, the opponent played the following cards:\n\n- Round 1: C\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: A\n- Round 5: E\n\nSince the opponent cannot play the same card twice, we need to adjust the sequence to ensure each card is used only once. The only possible sequence that fits all conditions is:\n\n- Round 1: C\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: D\n- Round 5: E\n\nThus, the opponent's cards were: <<<C, A, B, D, E>>>."
