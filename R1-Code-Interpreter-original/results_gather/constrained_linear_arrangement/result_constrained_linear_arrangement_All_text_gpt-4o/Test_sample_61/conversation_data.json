  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: F, loss.\nRound 2: D, win.\nRound 3: H, loss.\nRound 4: A, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules and the cards played by you.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played F (Dog) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than F (Dog) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than D (Leopard) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played H (Mouse) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than H (Mouse) to win, except for A (Elephant) because the Mouse can capture the Elephant.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played A (Elephant) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than A (Elephant) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the specific pieces played by the opponent in each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You lost with F (Dog), so the opponent played a piece higher than F.\n   - Possible pieces: A, B, C, D, E.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You won with D (Leopard), so the opponent played a piece lower than D.\n   - Possible pieces: E, F, G, H.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You lost with H (Mouse), so the opponent played a piece higher than H, but not A.\n   - Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You won with A (Elephant), so the opponent played a piece lower than A.\n   - Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\nBy process of elimination and considering the unique pieces that fit all rounds:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played E (Wolf) because it is higher than F (Dog) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent could have played F (Dog) because it is lower than D (Leopard) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played C (Tiger) because it is higher than H (Mouse) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent could have played B (Lion) because it is lower than A (Elephant) and not used in other rounds.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<E, F, C, B>>>"
