    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Dog (F) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than Dog (F).\n- Possible opponent pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Lion (B) and won.\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than Lion (B).\n- Possible opponent pieces: Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Elephant (A) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played Mouse (H) because the Mouse is the only piece that can capture the Elephant.\n- Opponent piece: Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than Mouse (H).\n- Possible opponent pieces: Cat (G), Dog (F), Wolf (E), Leopard (D), Tiger (C), Lion (B), Elephant (A).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece higher than Dog (F). Since Mouse (H) was used in Round 3, and the opponent won, the piece must be one of the higher-ranked pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece lower than Lion (B). Since Mouse (H) was used in Round 3, the piece must be one of the lower-ranked pieces: Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece higher than Mouse (H). Since Mouse (H) was used in Round 3, the piece must be one of the higher-ranked pieces: Cat (G), Dog (F), Wolf (E), Leopard (D), Tiger (C), Lion (B), or Elephant (A).\n\nConsidering the constraints and the results, we can deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Wolf (E) (since it is higher than Dog (F) and not used in other rounds)\n- **Round 2:** Dog (F) (since it is lower than Lion (B) and not used in other rounds)\n- **Round 3:** Mouse (H)\n- **Round 4:** Elephant (A) (since it is higher than Mouse (H) and not used in other rounds)\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<E, F, H, A>>>."
