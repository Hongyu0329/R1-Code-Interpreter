    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played a Lion (B) and won.\n- The Lion (B) can defeat any piece smaller than or equal to it, except for the Mouse (H) which it cannot encounter in this round since it won.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Lion (B), which could be Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played an Elephant (A) and won.\n- The Elephant (A) can defeat any piece except the Mouse (H), which can capture the Elephant.\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Elephant (A) and not a Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played a Tiger (C) and lost.\n- The Tiger (C) can defeat any piece smaller than or equal to it, except for the Mouse (H) which it cannot encounter in this round since it lost.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece larger than the Tiger (C), which could be Lion (B) or Elephant (A).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Since you won with a Lion (B), the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Lion (B). The possible pieces are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n- **Round 2:** Since you won with an Elephant (A), the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A) and not a Mouse (H). The possible pieces are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n- **Round 3:** Since you lost with a Tiger (C), the opponent must have played a piece larger than Tiger (C). The possible pieces are Lion (B) or Elephant (A).\n\nConsidering the overlap and elimination of possibilities:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent could have played Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played Lion (B) or Elephant (A).\n\nBy process of elimination and considering the results:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent likely played Tiger (C) because it is the highest-ranked piece that fits the criteria for both rounds 1 and 2.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent likely played Lion (B) because it fits the criteria for both rounds 2 and 3.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent likely played Elephant (A) because it is the only piece larger than Tiger (C) that fits the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<C, B, A>>>"
