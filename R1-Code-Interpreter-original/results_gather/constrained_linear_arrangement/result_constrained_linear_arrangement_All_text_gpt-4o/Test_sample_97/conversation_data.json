  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, draw.\nRound 2: E, loss.\nRound 3: D, win.\nRound 4: H, loss.\nRound 5: F, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules and the cards played by you.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: A (Elephant)\n- Result: Draw\n- Analysis: Since it was a draw, the opponent must have played the same piece, A (Elephant).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: E (Wolf)\n- Result: Loss\n- Analysis: The opponent must have played a piece larger than E (Wolf) to win. The possible pieces larger than E are A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), and D (Leopard). Since A was already used in Round 1, the opponent could have played B, C, or D.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: D (Leopard)\n- Result: Win\n- Analysis: You won, so the opponent must have played a piece smaller than D (Leopard). The possible pieces smaller than D are E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), and H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: H (Mouse)\n- Result: Loss\n- Analysis: The opponent must have played a piece that can capture H (Mouse). According to the rules, all pieces except A (Elephant) can capture H. Since A was used in Round 1, the opponent could have played B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played: F (Dog)\n- Result: Win\n- Analysis: You won, so the opponent must have played a piece smaller than F (Dog). The possible pieces smaller than F are G (Cat) and H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played A (Elephant) for a draw.\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard) to win against E (Wolf).\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse) to lose against D (Leopard).\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat) to win against H (Mouse).\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played G (Cat) or H (Mouse) to lose against F (Dog).\n\nConsidering the constraints and the need to use each piece only once, let's assign the most logical pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** A (Elephant)\n- **Round 2:** B (Lion) (since C and D are needed for other rounds)\n- **Round 3:** E (Wolf) (since F, G, and H are needed for other rounds)\n- **Round 4:** C (Tiger) (since D is needed for Round 2 and F, G are needed for Round 5)\n- **Round 5:** G (Cat) (since H is not possible due to the win condition)\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: <<<A, B, E, C, G>>>."
