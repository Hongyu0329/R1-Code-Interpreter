Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: E, draw.\nRound 4: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent, we need to analyze each round based on the rules provided. Since all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent must have played the same card as you in each round.\n\nLet's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played B (Fire), and it was a draw.**\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have also played B (Fire).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played C (Earth), and it was a draw.**\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have also played C (Earth).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played E (Water), and it was a draw.**\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have also played E (Water).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played D (Metal), and it was a draw.**\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have also played D (Metal).\n\nSince all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent played the same cards as you in each round. Therefore, the sequence of cards played by the opponent is:\n\n<<<B, C, E, D>>>"
