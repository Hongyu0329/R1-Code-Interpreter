  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, loss.\nRound 2: D, win.\nRound 3: G, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards played by you.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Elephant (A)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Elephant (A) is the largest piece, and it can only be captured by a Mouse (H) due to the special rule that a Mouse can capture an Elephant.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Leopard (D)\n- Result: Win\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Leopard (D) can capture any piece smaller than itself (E, F, G, H) and will lose to any piece larger than itself (A, B, C).\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Leopard (D), which could be Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n- However, since the Mouse (H) was already used in Round 1, the opponent could have played Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Cat (G)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Cat (G) can capture a Mouse (H) but will lose to any piece larger than itself (A, B, C, D, E, F).\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than a Cat (G), which could be Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Dog (F).\n- Since the Elephant (A) was not used by the opponent in Round 1, it could be a possibility, but the opponent could also have played Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Dog (F).\n\nBased on the analysis, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: H\n- Round 2: E, F, or G\n- Round 3: A, B, C, D, E, or F\n\nTo narrow down the possibilities, we consider the most likely scenario based on typical strategic play:\n- Round 2: F (Dog) is a reasonable choice as it is smaller than Leopard (D) and not used in Round 1.\n- Round 3: B (Lion) is a reasonable choice as it is larger than Cat (G) and not used in previous rounds.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cards played by the opponent are:\n<<<H, F, B>>>"
