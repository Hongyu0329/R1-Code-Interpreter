Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played E (Wolf) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than E (Wolf) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played G (Cat) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than G (Cat) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than D (Leopard) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played B (Lion) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than B (Lion) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played A (Elephant) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than A (Elephant) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than E (Wolf). Since they won, it could be A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played H (Mouse) because it's the only piece smaller than G (Cat) that would result in a win for you.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece larger than D (Leopard). Since they won, it could be A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece smaller than B (Lion). Since you won, it could be C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse). However, H (Mouse) was already used in Round 2.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece smaller than A (Elephant). Since you won, it could be B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse). However, H (Mouse) was already used in Round 2.\n\nBy process of elimination and considering the results of each round, we can deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** C (Tiger) - This is the only piece that fits the criteria of being larger than E (Wolf) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 2:** H (Mouse) - Already deduced.\n- **Round 3:** A (Elephant) - This is the only piece that fits the criteria of being larger than D (Leopard) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 4:** F (Dog) - This is the only piece that fits the criteria of being smaller than B (Lion) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 5:** D (Leopard) - This is the only piece that fits the criteria of being smaller than A (Elephant) and not used in other rounds.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<C, H, A, F, D>>>."
