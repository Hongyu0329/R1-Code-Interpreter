  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: C, loss.\nRound 4: B, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results provided.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Worm (D)\n- Result: Draw\n\nFor a draw to occur, the opponent must have played the same card or a card that is one step apart in the cycle. The cards that can result in a draw with Worm (D) are:\n- Worm (D) itself\n- Chicken (C), since Chicken eats Worm\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Stick (A)\n- Result: Draw\n\nFor a draw to occur, the opponent must have played the same card or a card that is one step apart in the cycle. The cards that can result in a draw with Stick (A) are:\n- Stick (A) itself\n- Worm (D), since Worm beats Stick\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Chicken (C)\n- Result: Loss\n\nFor you to lose, the opponent must have played a card that beats Chicken. The card that beats Chicken (C) is:\n- Tiger (B), since Tiger eats Chicken\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Tiger (B)\n- Result: Win\n\nFor you to win, the opponent must have played a card that is beaten by Tiger. The card that is beaten by Tiger (B) is:\n- Chicken (C), since Tiger eats Chicken\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played either Worm (D) or Chicken (C). Since Chicken (C) was played in Round 4, the opponent must have played Worm (D) in Round 1.\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played either Stick (A) or Worm (D). Since Worm (D) was played in Round 1, the opponent must have played Stick (A) in Round 2.\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played Tiger (B) to beat your Chicken (C).\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played Chicken (C), which was beaten by your Tiger (B).\n\nThus, the cards played by the opponent in each round are:\n\n<<<D, A, B, C>>>"
