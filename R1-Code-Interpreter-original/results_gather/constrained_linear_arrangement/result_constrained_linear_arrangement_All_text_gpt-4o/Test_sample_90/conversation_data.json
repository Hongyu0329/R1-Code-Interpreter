  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Tiger (C) and won.\n- Tiger (C) can defeat Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these pieces: D, E, F, G, or H.\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- Mouse (H) can only defeat Elephant (A).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Cat (G), Dog (F), Wolf (E), Leopard (D), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Wolf (E) and it was a draw.\n- A draw means the opponent also played Wolf (E).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Leopard (D) and lost.\n- Leopard (D) can defeat Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Lion (B), Tiger (C), or Elephant (A).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played Lion (B) and won.\n- Lion (B) can defeat Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these pieces: C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece that Tiger (C) can defeat. Possible pieces: D, E, F, G, H.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece that can defeat Mouse (H). Possible pieces: G, F, E, D, B, C.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Wolf (E).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece that can defeat Leopard (D). Possible pieces: B, C, A.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece that Lion (B) can defeat. Possible pieces: C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\nBy elimination and matching the possible pieces for each round, we can deduce:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played Leopard (D).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Tiger (C).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Wolf (E).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Elephant (A).\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played Cat (G).\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<D, C, E, A, G>>>."
