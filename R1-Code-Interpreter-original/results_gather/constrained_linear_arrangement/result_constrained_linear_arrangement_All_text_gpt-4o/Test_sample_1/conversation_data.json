  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, loss.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: A, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent, we need to analyze each round based on the rules provided and the results of each round.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played card B (Fire).\n- Result: Loss.\n- According to the rules, you lose if your card generates the opponent's card. Fire generates Earth (C). Therefore, the opponent must have played card C (Earth).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played card C (Earth).\n- Result: Draw.\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same card or when no card generates or overcomes the other. Since you played Earth, the opponent must have also played Earth (C) for it to be a draw.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played card A (Wood).\n- Result: Draw.\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same card or when no card generates or overcomes the other. Since you played Wood, the opponent must have also played Wood (A) for it to be a draw.\n\nBased on the analysis of each round, the opponent played the following cards:\n\n<<<C, C, A>>>"
