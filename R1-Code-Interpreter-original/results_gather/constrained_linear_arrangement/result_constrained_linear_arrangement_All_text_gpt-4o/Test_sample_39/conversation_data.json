  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: G, loss.\nRound 2: H, loss.\nRound 3: F, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step, considering the rules of the game.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Cat (G)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Cat (G) can be captured by any piece ranked higher than it (A, B, C, D, E, F).\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than G.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Mouse (H)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Mouse (H) can capture the Elephant (A) but loses to any other piece (B, C, D, E, F, G).\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece other than the Elephant.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Dog (F)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Dog (F) can be captured by any piece ranked higher than it (A, B, C, D, E).\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than F.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A, B, C, D, E\n\n**Combining the Analysis:**\n- From Round 1, the opponent's piece could be A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n- From Round 2, the opponent's piece could be B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n- From Round 3, the opponent's piece could be A, B, C, D, or E.\n\n**Intersection of Possible Pieces:**\n- The common possible pieces from all rounds are B, C, D, and E.\n\nSince each piece can only be used once, we need to assign one piece to each round based on the possible options:\n\n- Round 1: The opponent could have played E (Wolf) to capture G (Cat).\n- Round 2: The opponent could have played B (Lion) to capture H (Mouse).\n- Round 3: The opponent could have played D (Leopard) to capture F (Dog).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<E, B, D>>>"
