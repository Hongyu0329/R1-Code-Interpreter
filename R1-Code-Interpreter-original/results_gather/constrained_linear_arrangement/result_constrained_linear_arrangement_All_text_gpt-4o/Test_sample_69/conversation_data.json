  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: H, loss.\nRound 2: A, win.\nRound 3: F, draw.\nRound 4: G, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- According to the rules, the Mouse can only lose to the Cat (G) or Dog (F) because it can capture the Elephant (A) and draw with another Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played either Cat (G) or Dog (F).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Elephant (A) and won.\n- The Elephant can only lose to the Mouse (H) and draw with another Elephant (A).\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Elephant, which could be Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Dog (F) and it was a draw.\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Dog (F).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Cat (G) and it was a draw.\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played Cat (G).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played either Cat (G) or Dog (F). Since Dog (F) was used in Round 3, the opponent must have played Cat (G) in Round 1.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Elephant (A) and different from Dog (F) and Cat (G). The possible pieces are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Mouse (H).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Dog (F).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Cat (G).\n\nConsidering the above deductions, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<G, B, F, G>>>"
