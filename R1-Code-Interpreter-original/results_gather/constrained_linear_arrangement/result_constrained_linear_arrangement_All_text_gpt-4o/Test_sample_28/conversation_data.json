  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D).

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results provided. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played B (Tiger), and the result was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n   - The cards that can result in a draw with B (Tiger) are B (Tiger) itself or D (Worm), as Worm beats Stick, which is one step apart from Tiger.\n   - Therefore, the opponent could have played either B (Tiger) or D (Worm).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played A (Stick), and the result was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n   - The cards that can result in a draw with A (Stick) are A (Stick) itself or C (Chicken), as Chicken eats Worm, which is one step apart from Stick.\n   - Therefore, the opponent could have played either A (Stick) or C (Chicken).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played D (Worm), and the result was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n   - The cards that can result in a draw with D (Worm) are D (Worm) itself or B (Tiger), as Tiger eats Chicken, which is one step apart from Worm.\n   - Therefore, the opponent could have played either D (Worm) or B (Tiger).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played C (Chicken), and the result was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n   - The cards that can result in a draw with C (Chicken) are C (Chicken) itself or A (Stick), as Stick beats Tiger, which is one step apart from Chicken.\n   - Therefore, the opponent could have played either C (Chicken) or A (Stick).\n\nNow, let's deduce the exact cards the opponent played by considering the constraints that each card can only be used once:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played B or D.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played A or C.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played D or B.\n- From Round 4, the opponent could have played C or A.\n\nBy matching these possibilities with the constraint that each card is used only once, we can deduce:\n\n- In Round 1, the opponent played B (Tiger).\n- In Round 2, the opponent played A (Stick).\n- In Round 3, the opponent played D (Worm).\n- In Round 4, the opponent played C (Chicken).\n\nThus, the sequence of cards the opponent played is: <<<B, A, D, C>>>."
