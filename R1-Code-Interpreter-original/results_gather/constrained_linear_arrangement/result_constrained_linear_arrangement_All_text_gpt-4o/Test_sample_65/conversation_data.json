Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played G (Cat) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than G (Cat) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played B (Lion) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than B (Lion) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played A (Elephant) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than A (Elephant) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played E (Wolf) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than E (Wolf) to lose.\n- Possible opponent pieces: F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - The opponent played a piece higher than G (Cat). Since the opponent lost in subsequent rounds, they could not have played A (Elephant) or B (Lion) in Round 1. Therefore, the opponent played C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), or F (Dog).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - The opponent played a piece lower than B (Lion). Since the opponent lost, they could not have played C (Tiger) or D (Leopard) in Round 2. Therefore, the opponent played E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - The opponent played a piece lower than A (Elephant). Since the opponent lost, they could not have played B (Lion) in Round 3. Therefore, the opponent played C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - The opponent played a piece lower than E (Wolf). Therefore, the opponent played F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\nBy process of elimination and considering the rules, we can deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** C (Tiger)\n- **Round 2:** H (Mouse)\n- **Round 3:** D (Leopard)\n- **Round 4:** F (Dog)\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<C, H, D, F>>>."
