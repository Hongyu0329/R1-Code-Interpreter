  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step, considering the rules of the game.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Tiger (C)\n- Result: Win\n\nSince you won with a Tiger, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Tiger. The possible pieces the opponent could have played are Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Elephant (A)\n- Result: Win\n\nThe Elephant is the largest piece, so the opponent must have played a piece smaller than an Elephant. The possible pieces the opponent could have played are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H). However, since you won, it cannot be Mouse (H) because Mouse captures Elephant.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Cat (G)\n- Result: Loss\n\nSince you lost with a Cat, the opponent must have played a piece larger than a Cat. The possible pieces the opponent could have played are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Wolf (E)\n- Result: Win\n\nSince you won with a Wolf, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Wolf. The possible pieces the opponent could have played are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played: Leopard (D)\n- Result: Win\n\nSince you won with a Leopard, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Leopard. The possible pieces the opponent could have played are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Tiger (C). Possible pieces: D, E, F, G, H.\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Elephant (A) but not Mouse (H). Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G.\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece larger than Cat (G). Possible pieces: A, B, C, D, E.\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Wolf (E). Possible pieces: F, G, H.\n5. **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Leopard (D). Possible pieces: E, F, G, H.\n\nBy cross-referencing the possible pieces for each round and considering that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played Leopard (D).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Lion (B).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Tiger (C).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Cat (G).\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played Dog (F).\n\nThus, the list of the opponent's pieces for each round is: <<<D, B, C, G, F>>>."
