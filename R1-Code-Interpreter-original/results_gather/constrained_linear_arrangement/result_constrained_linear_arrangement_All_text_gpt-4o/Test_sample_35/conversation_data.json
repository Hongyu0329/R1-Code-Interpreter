  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, loss.\nRound 2: C, win.\nRound 3: D, loss.\nRound 4: A, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Tiger (B)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAccording to the rules, Tiger (B) loses to Chicken (C) and draws with Tiger (B). Since you lost, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Chicken (C)\n- Result: Win\n\nChicken (C) wins against Worm (D) and draws with Chicken (C). Since you won, the opponent must have played Worm (D).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Worm (D)\n- Result: Loss\n\nWorm (D) loses to Chicken (C) and draws with Worm (D). Since you lost, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Stick (A)\n- Result: Win\n\nStick (A) wins against Tiger (B) and draws with Stick (A). Since you won, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n\nNow, let's list the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: C\n- Round 2: D\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: B\n\nThe opponent's cards in order are: <<<C, D, C, B>>>."
