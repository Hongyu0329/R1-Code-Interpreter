  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, win.\nRound 2: H, loss.\nRound 3: B, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards played by you.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Tiger (C)\n- Result: Win\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Tiger (C) can defeat any piece smaller than itself: Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- The Tiger (C) cannot defeat Elephant (A) or Lion (B) as they are larger.\n- The Tiger (C) would draw with another Tiger (C).\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Tiger (C), which are Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Mouse (H)\n- Result: Loss\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Mouse (H) can only defeat the Elephant (A) due to the special rule.\n- The Mouse (H) would draw with another Mouse (H).\n- The Mouse (H) loses to any other piece: Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than the Mouse (H), which are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Lion (B)\n- Result: Win\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Lion (B) can defeat any piece smaller than itself: Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- The Lion (B) cannot defeat Elephant (A) as it is larger.\n- The Lion (B) would draw with another Lion (B).\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Lion (B), which are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Round 1: Opponent played a piece smaller than Tiger (C), so possibilities are D, E, F, G, H.\n- Round 2: Opponent played a piece larger than Mouse (H), so possibilities are B, C, D, E, F, G.\n- Round 3: Opponent played a piece smaller than Lion (B), so possibilities are C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\nBy cross-referencing the possibilities:\n- Round 1: D, E, F, G, H\n- Round 2: B, C, D, E, F, G\n- Round 3: C, D, E, F, G, H\n\nThe only consistent set of pieces that fit all rounds is:\n- Round 1: Leopard (D)\n- Round 2: Tiger (C)\n- Round 3: Dog (F)\n\nTherefore, the opponent played <<<D, C, F>>>."
