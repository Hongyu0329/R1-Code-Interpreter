    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Leopard (D) and won.\n- Leopard (D) can win against Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these pieces: E, F, G, or H.\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Elephant (A) and won.\n- Elephant (A) can win against Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), and Cat (G).\n- The opponent cannot have played Mouse (H) because Mouse captures Elephant.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these pieces: B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Wolf (E) and lost.\n- Wolf (E) can be defeated by Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), and Leopard (D).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these pieces: A, B, C, or D.\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Dog (F) and lost.\n- Dog (F) can be defeated by Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), and Wolf (E).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these pieces: A, B, C, D, or E.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played one of E, F, G, or H. Since you won with D, and considering the other rounds, the opponent likely played Mouse (H) because it is the only piece that doesn't appear in the other rounds' possibilities.\n  \n- **Round 2:** The opponent played one of B, C, D, E, F, or G. Since you won with A, and considering the other rounds, the opponent likely played Cat (G) because it is the only piece that doesn't appear in the other rounds' possibilities.\n\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played one of A, B, C, or D. Since you lost with E, and considering the other rounds, the opponent likely played Tiger (C) because it is the only piece that doesn't appear in the other rounds' possibilities.\n\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played one of A, B, C, D, or E. Since you lost with F, and considering the other rounds, the opponent likely played Lion (B) because it is the only piece that doesn't appear in the other rounds' possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<H, G, C, B>>>."
