  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results provided.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: Worm (D)\n- Result: Draw\n\nFor a draw to occur, the opponent must have played the same card or a card that is one step apart in the cycle. The cycle is: Stick (A) -> Tiger (B) -> Chicken (C) -> Worm (D) -> Stick (A).\n\n- Possible opponent cards: Worm (D) or Chicken (C)\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: Stick (A)\n- Result: Draw\n\nFor a draw to occur, the opponent must have played the same card or a card that is one step apart in the cycle.\n\n- Possible opponent cards: Stick (A) or Worm (D)\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: Tiger (B)\n- Result: Loss\n\nFor you to lose, the opponent must have played a card that beats Tiger. According to the rules, Stick (A) beats Tiger (B).\n\n- Opponent card: Stick (A)\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: Chicken (C)\n- Result: Loss\n\nFor you to lose, the opponent must have played a card that beats Chicken. According to the rules, Tiger (B) beats Chicken (C).\n\n- Opponent card: Tiger (B)\n\nNow, let's deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round:\n\n- Round 3 confirms that the opponent played Stick (A).\n- Round 4 confirms that the opponent played Tiger (B).\n- In Round 1, the opponent could have played either Worm (D) or Chicken (C). Since Stick (A) and Tiger (B) are already used, the opponent must have played Chicken (C) in Round 1.\n- In Round 2, the opponent could have played either Stick (A) or Worm (D). Since Stick (A) is already used, the opponent must have played Worm (D) in Round 2.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n<<<C, D, A, B>>>"
