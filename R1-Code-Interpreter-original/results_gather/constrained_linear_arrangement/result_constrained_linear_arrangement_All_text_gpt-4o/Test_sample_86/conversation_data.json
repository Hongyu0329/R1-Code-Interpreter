  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Leopard (D) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a larger piece than Leopard (D). The possible pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Elephant (A) and won.\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a smaller piece than Elephant (A). The possible pieces are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Tiger (C) and it was a draw.\n- Since it was a draw, the opponent must have also played Tiger (C).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Dog (F) and won.\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a smaller piece than Dog (F). The possible pieces are Cat (G) or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played Cat (G) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a larger piece than Cat (G). The possible pieces are Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Lion (B), or Elephant (A).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than Leopard (D). Possible pieces: A, B, C.\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Elephant (A). Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G, H.\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played Tiger (C).\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Dog (F). Possible pieces: G, H.\n5. **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece larger than Cat (G). Possible pieces: D, E, F, B, A.\n\nBy elimination and considering the rules:\n- In Round 1, the opponent could have played A, B, or C. Since C was used in Round 3, the opponent played either A or B.\n- In Round 2, the opponent played a piece smaller than A. Since C was used in Round 3, and A or B was used in Round 1, the opponent played a piece from D, E, F, G, or H.\n- In Round 4, the opponent played a piece smaller than F, which means G or H. Since G was used in Round 5, the opponent played H.\n- In Round 5, the opponent played a piece larger than G. Since C was used in Round 3, and H was used in Round 4, the opponent played D, E, F, B, or A.\n\nConsidering all rounds and the pieces used:\n- Round 1: B (since A was used in Round 2)\n- Round 2: E (since D was used in Round 5, F was used in Round 4, and G was used in Round 5)\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: H\n- Round 5: D\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<B, E, C, H, D>>>."
