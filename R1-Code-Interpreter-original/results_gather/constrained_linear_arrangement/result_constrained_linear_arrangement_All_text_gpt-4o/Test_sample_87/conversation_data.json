  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: H, loss.\nRound 2: B, loss.\nRound 3: E, loss.\nRound 4: D, win.\nRound 5: C, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step, considering the rules of the game.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played H (Mouse) and lost.\n- According to the rules, the Mouse can only lose to a Cat (G) or a Dog (F) since it can capture an Elephant (A).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played either G or F.\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played B (Lion) and lost.\n- The Lion can only lose to an Elephant (A) since it is the second strongest piece.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played A.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played E (Wolf) and lost.\n- The Wolf can lose to a Leopard (D), Tiger (C), Lion (B), or Elephant (A).\n- Since A was already used in Round 2, the opponent must have played either D, C, or B.\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and won.\n- The Leopard can win against a Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n- Since G or F was used in Round 1, the opponent must have played either E or H.\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played C (Tiger) and won.\n- The Tiger can win against a Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n- Since E or H was used in Round 4, and G or F was used in Round 1, the opponent must have played D.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played G or F.\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played A.\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played B, C, or D.\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played E or H.\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played D.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played G.\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played A.\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played B.\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played E.\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played D.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<G, A, B, E, D>>>."
