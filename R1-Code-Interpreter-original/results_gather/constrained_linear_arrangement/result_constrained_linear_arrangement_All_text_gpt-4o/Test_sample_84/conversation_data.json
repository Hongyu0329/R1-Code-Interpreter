  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, win.\nRound 2: B, win.\nRound 3: E, win.\nRound 4: G, loss.\nRound 5: A, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes provided.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Leopard (D) and won.\n- Leopard (D) can win against Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these: E, F, G, or H.\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Lion (B) and won.\n- Lion (B) can win against Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these: C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Wolf (E) and won.\n- Wolf (E) can win against Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these: F, G, or H.\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Cat (G) and lost.\n- Cat (G) can only lose to Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), and Wolf (E).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these: A, B, C, D, or E.\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played Elephant (A) and won.\n- Elephant (A) can win against Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), and Cat (G).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these: B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards by considering the constraints from each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played E, F, G, or H.\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played F, G, or H.\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played A, B, C, D, or E.\n5. **Round 5:** The opponent played B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\nBy process of elimination and considering the unique use of each piece:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played F (Dog), as it fits all constraints.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent could have played C (Tiger), as it fits all constraints.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played H (Mouse), as it fits all constraints.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent could have played E (Wolf), as it fits all constraints.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent could have played G (Cat), as it fits all constraints.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are: <<<F, C, H, E, G>>>."
