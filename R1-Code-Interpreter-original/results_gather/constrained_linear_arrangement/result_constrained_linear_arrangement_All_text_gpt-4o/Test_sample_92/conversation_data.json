  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: H, loss.\nRound 2: G, loss.\nRound 3: E, loss.\nRound 4: B, win.\nRound 5: D, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played Mouse (H) and lost.\n- According to the rules, the Mouse can only lose to the Cat (G) or Dog (F) or any piece larger than these.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to Cat (G).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played Cat (G) and lost.\n- The Cat can lose to Dog (F), Wolf (E), Leopard (D), Tiger (C), Lion (B), or Elephant (A).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to Dog (F).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played Wolf (E) and lost.\n- The Wolf can lose to Leopard (D), Tiger (C), Lion (B), or Elephant (A).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to Leopard (D).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played Lion (B) and won.\n- The Lion can win against any piece except Elephant (A).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Lion (B), which could be Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played Leopard (D) and won.\n- The Leopard can win against Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Leopard (D).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than or equal to Cat (G). Possible pieces: G, F, E, D, C, B, A.\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece larger than or equal to Dog (F). Possible pieces: F, E, D, C, B, A.\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece larger than or equal to Leopard (D). Possible pieces: D, C, B, A.\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Lion (B). Possible pieces: C, D, E, F, G, H.\n5. **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Leopard (D). Possible pieces: E, F, G, H.\n\nBy process of elimination and considering the rules, we can deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played Dog (F) (since it is the smallest piece that can beat Mouse (H) and is consistent with the other rounds).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Wolf (E) (since it is the smallest piece that can beat Cat (G) and is consistent with the other rounds).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Leopard (D) (since it is the smallest piece that can beat Wolf (E) and is consistent with the other rounds).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Tiger (C) (since it is the smallest piece that can lose to Lion (B) and is consistent with the other rounds).\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played Cat (G) (since it is the smallest piece that can lose to Leopard (D) and is consistent with the other rounds).\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<F, E, D, C, G>>>."
