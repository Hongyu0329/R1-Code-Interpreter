  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, loss.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",
