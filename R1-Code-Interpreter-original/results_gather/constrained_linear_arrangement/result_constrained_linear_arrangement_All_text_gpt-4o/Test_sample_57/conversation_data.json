Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round step by step:\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played E (Wolf) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than E (Wolf).\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and won.\n- Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than D (Leopard).\n- Possible opponent pieces: E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played F (Dog) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than F (Dog).\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played A (Elephant) and lost.\n- Since you lost, the opponent must have played H (Mouse) because the Mouse is the only piece that can capture the Elephant.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played H (Mouse) because it is the only piece that can capture your A (Elephant).\n\n- **Round 1:** Since the opponent played H (Mouse) in Round 4, they couldn't have played it in Round 1. The opponent must have played one of the larger pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard). Since you lost with E (Wolf), the opponent could have played A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard).\n\n- **Round 2:** You won with D (Leopard), so the opponent played a piece smaller than D (Leopard). Possible pieces are E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse). Since H (Mouse) was used in Round 4, the opponent could have played E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat).\n\n- **Round 3:** You lost with F (Dog), so the opponent played a piece larger than F (Dog). Possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard). Since D (Leopard) was used in Round 2, the opponent could have played A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n\nConsidering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce the following:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played C (Tiger) because it is larger than E (Wolf) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played G (Cat) because it is smaller than D (Leopard) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played B (Lion) because it is larger than F (Dog) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played H (Mouse) as deduced earlier.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<C, G, B, H>>>."
