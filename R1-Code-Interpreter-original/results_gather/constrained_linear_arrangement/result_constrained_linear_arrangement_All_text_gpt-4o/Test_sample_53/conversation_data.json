  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: A, win.\nRound 3: B, win.\nRound 4: D, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent, we need to analyze each round based on the rules provided and the results of each round.\n\n### Round 1:\n- **Your Card**: C (Earth)\n- **Result**: Draw\n- **Analysis**: Since the result is a draw, the opponent must have played the same card, C (Earth).\n\n### Round 2:\n- **Your Card**: A (Wood)\n- **Result**: Win\n- **Analysis**: For you to win, your card A (Wood) must overcome the opponent's card. According to the overcoming rule, Wood A overcomes Earth C. Therefore, the opponent played C (Earth).\n\n### Round 3:\n- **Your Card**: B (Fire)\n- **Result**: Win\n- **Analysis**: For you to win, your card B (Fire) must overcome the opponent's card. According to the overcoming rule, Fire B overcomes Metal D. Therefore, the opponent played D (Metal).\n\n### Round 4:\n- **Your Card**: D (Metal)\n- **Result**: Loss\n- **Analysis**: For you to lose, the opponent's card must generate your card D (Metal). According to the generation rule, Fire B generates Metal D. Therefore, the opponent played B (Fire).\n\nBased on the analysis, the opponent's cards for each round are as follows:\n\n<<<C, C, D, B>>>"
