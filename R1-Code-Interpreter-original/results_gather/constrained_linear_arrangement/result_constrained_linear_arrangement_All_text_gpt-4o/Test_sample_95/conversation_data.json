  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: F, draw.\nRound 2: C, win.\nRound 3: A, loss.\nRound 4: G, loss.\nRound 5: D, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes provided.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played F (Dog) and the result was a draw.\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played F (Dog).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played C (Tiger) and you won.\n- You win when your piece is larger than the opponent's piece.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than C (Tiger), which could be D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n- Since F (Dog) was already used in Round 1, the opponent could have played D (Leopard), E (Wolf), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played A (Elephant) and you lost.\n- You lose when the opponent's piece is larger than yours or if the opponent played H (Mouse), which can capture A (Elephant).\n- The opponent must have played H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played G (Cat) and you lost.\n- You lose when the opponent's piece is larger than yours.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than G (Cat), which could be A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), or E (Wolf).\n- Since A (Elephant) and H (Mouse) have already been used, the opponent could have played B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), or E (Wolf).\n\n**Round 5:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and you lost.\n- You lose when the opponent's piece is larger than yours.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than D (Leopard), which could be A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n- Since A (Elephant) and H (Mouse) have already been used, the opponent could have played B (Lion) or C (Tiger).\n\nNow, let's deduce the exact pieces played by the opponent in Rounds 2, 4, and 5:\n\n- In Round 2, the opponent played a piece smaller than C (Tiger) and it could be D (Leopard), E (Wolf), G (Cat), or H (Mouse). Since H (Mouse) was used in Round 3, the opponent could have played D (Leopard), E (Wolf), or G (Cat).\n\n- In Round 4, the opponent played a piece larger than G (Cat) and it could be B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), or E (Wolf). Since D (Leopard) was used in Round 5, the opponent could have played B (Lion), C (Tiger), or E (Wolf).\n\n- In Round 5, the opponent played a piece larger than D (Leopard) and it could be B (Lion) or C (Tiger).\n\nConsidering the constraints and the need to use each piece only once, the most logical distribution is:\n\n- Round 2: E (Wolf)\n- Round 4: C (Tiger)\n- Round 5: B (Lion)\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<F, E, H, C, B>>>"
