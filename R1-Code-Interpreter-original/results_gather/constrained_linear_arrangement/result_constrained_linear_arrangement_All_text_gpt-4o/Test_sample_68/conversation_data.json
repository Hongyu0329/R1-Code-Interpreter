  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, win.\nRound 2: G, draw.\nRound 3: E, win.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the cards played by the opponent in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules provided and the cards you played.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played: A (Elephant)\n- Result: Win\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Elephant (A) can only be captured by a Mouse (H) due to the special rule, but since you won, the opponent could not have played H.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than A, which are B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played: G (Cat)\n- Result: Draw\n\nAnalysis:\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played G (Cat).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played: E (Wolf)\n- Result: Win\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Wolf (E) can be captured by D (Leopard), C (Tiger), B (Lion), or A (Elephant), but since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than E, which are F (Dog) or H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played: B (Lion)\n- Result: Draw\n\nAnalysis:\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n- Therefore, the opponent must have played B (Lion).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than A, which could be B, C, D, E, F, or G. Since B and G are used in other rounds, the opponent could have played C, D, E, or F.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played G.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece smaller than E, which could be F or H. Since G is used in Round 2, the opponent played F.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played B.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the results, the most logical deduction is:\n\n<<<C, G, F, B>>>"
