  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: F, loss.\nRound 2: D, draw.\nRound 3: E, win.\nRound 4: H, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n**Round 1:**\n- You played F (Dog) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than F (Dog) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- You played D (Leopard) and it was a draw.\n- The opponent must have played the same piece, D (Leopard), for the result to be a draw.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- You played E (Wolf) and won.\n- The opponent must have played a piece smaller than E (Wolf) for you to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n**Round 4:**\n- You played H (Mouse) and lost.\n- The opponent must have played a piece larger than H (Mouse) to win.\n- Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than F (Dog). Since D (Leopard) was used in Round 2, the opponent could have played A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), or E (Wolf). However, E (Wolf) was not possible because you won with E (Wolf) in Round 3, so the opponent must have played A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n\n2. **Round 2:** The opponent played D (Leopard), as it was a draw.\n\n3. **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece smaller than E (Wolf). Since F (Dog) was used in Round 1, the opponent could have played G (Cat) or H (Mouse).\n\n4. **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece larger than H (Mouse). Since D (Leopard) was used in Round 2, and E (Wolf) was not possible because you won with E (Wolf) in Round 3, the opponent could have played B (Lion), C (Tiger), F (Dog), or G (Cat).\n\nConsidering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** C (Tiger) (since A (Elephant) would have been captured by H (Mouse) in Round 4, and B (Lion) is used in Round 4).\n- **Round 2:** D (Leopard).\n- **Round 3:** G (Cat) (since H (Mouse) would have been captured by E (Wolf)).\n- **Round 4:** B (Lion) (since it is larger than H (Mouse)).\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<C, D, G, B>>>."
