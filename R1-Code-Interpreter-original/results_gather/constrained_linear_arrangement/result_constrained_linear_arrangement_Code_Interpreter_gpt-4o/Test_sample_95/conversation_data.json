    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the results of each round based on the rules of the game and the cards you played.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played F (Dog), result was a draw.**\n   - Since it was a draw, your opponent must have also played F (Dog).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played C (Tiger), result was a win.**\n   - You won, which means your opponent played a piece smaller than C (Tiger). The possible pieces are D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played A (Elephant), result was a loss.**\n   - You lost, which means your opponent played H (Mouse), as the Mouse can capture the Elephant.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played G (Cat), result was a loss.**\n   - You lost, which means your opponent played a piece larger than G (Cat). The possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), or E (Wolf).\n\n5. **Round 5: You played D (Leopard), result was a loss.**\n   - You lost, which means your opponent played a piece larger than D (Leopard). The possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n\n### Deduction:\n\n- From Round 1, we know the opponent played F (Dog).\n- From Round 3, we know the opponent played H (Mouse).\n- From Round 2, the opponent played a piece smaller than C (Tiger) and not F (Dog) or H (Mouse). The possible pieces are D (Leopard), E (Wolf), or G (Cat).\n- From Round 4, the opponent played a piece larger than G (Cat) and not F (Dog) or H (Mouse). The possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), or E (Wolf).\n- From Round 5, the opponent played a piece larger than D (Leopard) and not F (Dog) or H (Mouse). The possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n\nLet's deduce the exact pieces for Rounds 2, 4, and 5:\n\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played E (Wolf) because it's the only piece smaller than C (Tiger) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played B (Lion) because it's larger than G (Cat) and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played C (Tiger) because it's larger than D (Leopard) and not used in other rounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe opponent played the following pieces in each round:\n- Round 1: F (Dog)\n- Round 2: E (Wolf)\n- Round 3: H (Mouse)\n- Round 4: B (Lion)\n- Round 5: C (Tiger)\n\nSo, the list of letters representing the opponent's cards is: <<<F, E, H, B, C>>>."
