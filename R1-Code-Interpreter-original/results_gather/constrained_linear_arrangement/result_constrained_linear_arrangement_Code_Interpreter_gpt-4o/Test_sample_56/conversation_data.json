    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Elephant (A)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Since the Elephant (A) is the largest piece, it can only be defeated by a Mouse (H). Since you won, your opponent must have played a piece smaller than an Elephant, but not a Mouse. Therefore, the opponent could have played any piece from Lion (B) to Leopard (D).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Tiger (C)\n   - Result: Win\n   - The Tiger (C) can defeat any piece smaller than itself, which includes Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Since you won, the opponent must have played one of these pieces.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Leopard (D)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - The Leopard (D) can be defeated by any piece larger than itself, which includes Elephant (A), Lion (B), and Tiger (C). Since you lost, the opponent must have played one of these pieces.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Cat (G)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - The Cat (G) can be defeated by any piece larger than itself, which includes Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), and Dog (F). Since you lost, the opponent must have played one of these pieces.\n\n### Deduced Opponent's Cards:\n\n- **Round 1:** Since you won with an Elephant (A), the opponent could have played Lion (B), Tiger (C), or Leopard (D).\n- **Round 2:** Since you won with a Tiger (C), the opponent could have played Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n- **Round 3:** Since you lost with a Leopard (D), the opponent could have played Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n- **Round 4:** Since you lost with a Cat (G), the opponent could have played Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Dog (F).\n\nNow, let's deduce the most likely sequence of cards the opponent played based on the constraints:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent plays Lion (B) (since it's the only card that can be played in Round 3 to win against Leopard (D)).\n- **Round 2:** Opponent plays Mouse (H) (since it's the only card that can be played in Round 4 to win against Cat (G)).\n- **Round 3:** Opponent plays Tiger (C) (since it can win against Leopard (D)).\n- **Round 4:** Opponent plays Wolf (E) (since it can win against Cat (G)).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: **B, H, C, E**.\n\nThe list of letters representing the opponent's cards in each round is: <<<B, H, C, E>>>."
