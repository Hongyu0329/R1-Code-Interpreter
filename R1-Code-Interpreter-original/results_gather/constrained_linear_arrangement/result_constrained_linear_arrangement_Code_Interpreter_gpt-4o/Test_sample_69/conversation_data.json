Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3.

    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played H (Mouse) and lost.**\n   - The Mouse can only lose to a Cat (G) or a Dog (F) or a Wolf (E) or a Leopard (D) or a Tiger (C) or a Lion (B). It cannot lose to an Elephant (A) because it captures the Elephant.\n   - Therefore, your opponent must have played one of the pieces G, F, E, D, C, or B.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played A (Elephant) and won.**\n   - The Elephant wins against all pieces except the Mouse (H), which captures it.\n   - Therefore, your opponent must have played a piece other than H. Since you won, they must have played a piece smaller than A, which could be B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played F (Dog) and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n   - Therefore, your opponent must have played F.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played G (Cat) and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n   - Therefore, your opponent must have played G.\n\nNow, let's deduce the most likely pieces your opponent played in each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Since you lost with H, the opponent could have played G, F, E, D, C, or B. However, since they played F in Round 3 and G in Round 4, they likely played a piece larger than F and G in Round 1. The most likely piece is B, C, D, or E.\n- **Round 2:** You won with A, so the opponent played a piece smaller than A. Since they played F in Round 3 and G in Round 4, they likely played B, C, D, or E in Round 2.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played G.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to use each piece only once, let's assume the following:\n\n- **Round 1:** B (Lion) - This is a reasonable choice as it is larger than H and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 2:** C (Tiger) - This is a reasonable choice as it is smaller than A and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 3:** F (Dog)\n- **Round 4:** G (Cat)\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are likely: <<<B, C, F, G>>>."
