Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4.

    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Leopard) and lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than D (Leopard) to win. Possible pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played H (Mouse) and lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than H (Mouse) to win. Possible pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat). Note that A (Elephant) cannot capture H (Mouse).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played A (Elephant) and lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played H (Mouse) to win, as the Mouse can capture the Elephant.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played E (Wolf) and it was a draw.**\n   - The opponent must have played E (Wolf) as well, since only identical pieces result in a draw.\n\n### Deduction:\n\n- **Round 3 confirms the opponent played H (Mouse).**\n- **Round 4 confirms the opponent played E (Wolf).**\n\nNow, let's deduce the remaining rounds:\n\n- **Round 1: The opponent played either A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).**\n- **Round 2: The opponent played either B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), F (Dog), or G (Cat).**\n\nSince the opponent played H (Mouse) in Round 3 and E (Wolf) in Round 4, they cannot play these again. \n\n- **Round 1: The opponent likely played C (Tiger) because it is the only piece that can also be played in Round 2 without conflicting with the results.**\n- **Round 2: The opponent likely played B (Lion) because it is larger than H (Mouse) and not used in other rounds.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe opponent's cards for each round are:\n- **Round 1: C (Tiger)**\n- **Round 2: B (Lion)**\n- **Round 3: H (Mouse)**\n- **Round 4: E (Wolf)**\n\nThus, the list of letters representing the opponent's cards is: <<<C, B, H, E>>>."
