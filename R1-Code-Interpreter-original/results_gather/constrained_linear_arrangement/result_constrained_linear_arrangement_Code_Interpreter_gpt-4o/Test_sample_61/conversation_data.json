    "\nassistant > To deduce the opponent's cards based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game:\n\n1. **Round 1: F (Dog), loss.**\n   - The Dog (F) lost, which means the opponent played a piece ranked higher than the Dog. Possible opponent pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n2. **Round 2: D (Leopard), win.**\n   - The Leopard (D) won, which means the opponent played a piece ranked lower than the Leopard. Possible opponent pieces: Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: H (Mouse), loss.**\n   - The Mouse (H) lost, which means the opponent played a piece ranked higher than the Mouse, except for the Elephant (A) since the Mouse can capture the Elephant. Possible opponent pieces: Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n4. **Round 4: A (Elephant), win.**\n   - The Elephant (A) won, which means the opponent played a piece ranked lower than the Elephant, except for the Mouse (H) since the Mouse can capture the Elephant. Possible opponent pieces: Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece higher than Dog (F). Since the opponent lost in Round 2 with a piece lower than Leopard (D), they could not have played Leopard (D) in Round 1. Therefore, the opponent played Wolf (E) in Round 1.\n\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece lower than Leopard (D). Since the opponent won in Round 3 with a piece higher than Mouse (H), they could not have played Mouse (H) in Round 2. Therefore, the opponent played Cat (G) in Round 2.\n\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece higher than Mouse (H). Since the opponent lost in Round 4 with a piece lower than Elephant (A), they could not have played Lion (B) or Tiger (C) in Round 3. Therefore, the opponent played Leopard (D) in Round 3.\n\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece lower than Elephant (A). Since the opponent has already used Wolf (E), Cat (G), and Leopard (D), the opponent played Dog (F) in Round 4.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are: <<<E, G, D, F>>>."
