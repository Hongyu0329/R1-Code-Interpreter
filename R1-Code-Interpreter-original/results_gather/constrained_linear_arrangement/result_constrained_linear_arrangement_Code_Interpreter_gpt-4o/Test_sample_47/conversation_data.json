When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1.

    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards played by the opponent, we need to analyze each round based on the rules provided.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. **Generation**: \n   - Wood (A) generates Fire (B)\n   - Fire (B) generates Earth (C)\n   - Earth (C) generates Metal (D)\n   - Metal (D) generates Water (E)\n   - Water (E) generates Wood (A)\n\n2. **Overcoming**:\n   - Wood (A) overcomes Earth (C)\n   - Earth (C) overcomes Water (E)\n   - Water (E) overcomes Fire (B)\n   - Fire (B) overcomes Metal (D)\n   - Metal (D) overcomes Wood (A)\n\n### Rounds Analysis:\n1. **Round 1**: You played Earth (C), and it was a draw.\n   - Opponent must have played Earth (C).\n\n2. **Round 2**: You played Fire (B), and you lost.\n   - Fire (B) is generated by Wood (A), so the opponent played Wood (A).\n\n3. **Round 3**: You played Metal (D), and it was a draw.\n   - Opponent must have played Metal (D).\n\n4. **Round 4**: You played Wood (A), and it was a draw.\n   - Opponent must have played Wood (A).\n\nBased on this analysis, the cards played by the opponent in each round are:\n\n\\[ \\text{Opponent's cards: } [C, A, D, A] \\]"
