    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played E (Wolf), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than E (Wolf) to win. Possible pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played D (Leopard), and you won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece smaller than D (Leopard) to lose. Possible pieces: E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played F (Dog), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than F (Dog) to win. Possible pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played A (Elephant), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played H (Mouse) to win, as the Mouse can capture the Elephant.\n\n### Deduction:\n\n- **Round 4** is straightforward: Opponent played H (Mouse).\n- **Round 2**: Since you won with D (Leopard), the opponent played a piece smaller than D. Possible pieces are E, F, G, H. Since H is used in Round 4, the opponent played either E, F, or G.\n- **Round 1**: You lost with E (Wolf), so the opponent played a piece larger than E. Possible pieces are A, B, C, D. Since D is not possible (as you won with D in Round 2), the opponent played A, B, or C.\n- **Round 3**: You lost with F (Dog), so the opponent played a piece larger than F. Possible pieces are A, B, C, D, E. Since D is not possible (as you won with D in Round 2), and E is not possible (as you lost with E in Round 1), the opponent played A, B, or C.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to use each piece only once, let's deduce the most likely sequence:\n\n- **Round 1**: Opponent played C (Tiger).\n- **Round 2**: Opponent played G (Cat).\n- **Round 3**: Opponent played B (Lion).\n- **Round 4**: Opponent played H (Mouse).\n\nThus, the opponent's sequence of plays is: <<<C, G, B, H>>>."
