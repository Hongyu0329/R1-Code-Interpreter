    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played. Let's go through each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played B (Lion), and you won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece smaller than B (Lion), which are C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played G (Cat), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than G (Cat), which are A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), or E (Wolf).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than H (Mouse), which are B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), or F (Dog). Note that A (Elephant) cannot capture H (Mouse).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played F (Dog), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than F (Dog), which are A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard).\n\n5. **Round 5: You played C (Tiger), and you won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece smaller than C (Tiger), which are D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than B (Lion). Possible pieces: C, D, E, F, G, H.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece larger than G (Cat). Possible pieces: A, B, C, D, E.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece larger than H (Mouse). Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece larger than F (Dog). Possible pieces: A, B, C, D.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece smaller than C (Tiger). Possible pieces: D, E, F, G, H.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once, let's deduce the most likely sequence of the opponent's cards:\n\n- **Round 1:** E (Wolf) - Smaller than B (Lion).\n- **Round 2:** A (Elephant) - Larger than G (Cat).\n- **Round 3:** B (Lion) - Larger than H (Mouse).\n- **Round 4:** D (Leopard) - Larger than F (Dog).\n- **Round 5:** G (Cat) - Smaller than C (Tiger).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: <<<E, A, B, D, G>>>."
