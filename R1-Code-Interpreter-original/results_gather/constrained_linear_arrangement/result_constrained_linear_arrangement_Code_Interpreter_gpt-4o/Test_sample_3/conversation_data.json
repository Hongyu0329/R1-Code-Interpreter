    "\nassistant > To deduce what cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules of the game and the cards you played.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Stick (A) beats Tiger (B).\n2. Tiger (B) beats Chicken (C).\n3. Chicken (C) beats Worm (D).\n4. Worm (D) beats Stick (A).\n5. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is a draw.\n\n### Analysis of Each Round:\n\n- **Round 1: You played A (Stick), and it was a draw.**\n  - Possible opponent cards: A (Stick) or D (Worm).\n\n- **Round 2: You played B (Tiger), and it was a draw.**\n  - Possible opponent cards: B (Tiger) or A (Stick).\n\n- **Round 3: You played C (Chicken), and you lost.**\n  - Opponent must have played B (Tiger) because Tiger beats Chicken.\n\n- **Round 4: You played D (Worm), and you lost.**\n  - Opponent must have played C (Chicken) because Chicken beats Worm.\n\n### Deducing the Opponent's Cards:\n\n- From Round 3, we know the opponent played B (Tiger).\n- From Round 4, we know the opponent played C (Chicken).\n- For Round 1, since the opponent played B in Round 3 and C in Round 4, they couldn't have played D in Round 1 (as they would have no card left for Round 4). Therefore, they must have played A (Stick) in Round 1.\n- For Round 2, since the opponent played A in Round 1 and B in Round 3, they must have played D (Worm) in Round 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: A (Stick)\n- Round 2: D (Worm)\n- Round 3: B (Tiger)\n- Round 4: C (Chicken)\n\nSo, the list of letters representing the opponent's cards is: \\([A, D, B, C]\\)."
