Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3.

    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played H (Mouse) and lost.**\n   - The Mouse can only lose to a Cat (G) or a Dog (F) since it can capture an Elephant (A) and draws with another Mouse (H).\n   - Therefore, your opponent played either G or F.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played F (Dog) and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same piece.\n   - Therefore, your opponent played F.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played C (Tiger) and won.**\n   - The Tiger can win against Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n   - Therefore, your opponent played one of these: D, E, F, G, or H.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played A (Elephant) and won.**\n   - The Elephant can win against Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), and Cat (G).\n   - Therefore, your opponent played one of these: B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\n5. **Round 5: You played E (Wolf) and won.**\n   - The Wolf can win against Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n   - Therefore, your opponent played one of these: F, G, or H.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards by considering the constraints:\n\n- In Round 1, the opponent played either G or F.\n- In Round 2, the opponent played F.\n- In Round 3, the opponent played one of D, E, F, G, or H.\n- In Round 4, the opponent played one of B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n- In Round 5, the opponent played one of F, G, or H.\n\nSince the opponent played F in Round 2, they couldn't have played F in any other round. Therefore:\n\n- In Round 1, the opponent played G.\n- In Round 3, the opponent played H (since D, E, and G are not possible due to other constraints).\n- In Round 4, the opponent played B (since C, D, E, F, and G are not possible due to other constraints).\n- In Round 5, the opponent played G (since F and H are not possible due to other constraints).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards were: <<<G, F, H, B, G>>>."
