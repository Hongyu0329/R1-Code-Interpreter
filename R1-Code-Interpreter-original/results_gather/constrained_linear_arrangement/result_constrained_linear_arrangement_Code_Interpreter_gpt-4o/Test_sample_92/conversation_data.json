    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - The Mouse can only be captured by a Cat (G) or a Dog (F) or a Wolf (E) or a Leopard (D) or a Tiger (C) or a Lion (B). Since you lost, your opponent must have played one of these pieces. However, since the Mouse can capture the Elephant (A), the opponent did not play A.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played G (Cat), and you lost.**\n   - The Cat can be captured by a Dog (F) or a Wolf (E) or a Leopard (D) or a Tiger (C) or a Lion (B) or an Elephant (A). Since you lost, your opponent must have played one of these pieces.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played E (Wolf), and you lost.**\n   - The Wolf can be captured by a Leopard (D) or a Tiger (C) or a Lion (B) or an Elephant (A). Since you lost, your opponent must have played one of these pieces.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played B (Lion), and you won.**\n   - The Lion can only be captured by an Elephant (A). Since you won, your opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Lion, which means they played C (Tiger) or smaller.\n\n5. **Round 5: You played D (Leopard), and you won.**\n   - The Leopard can be captured by a Tiger (C) or a Lion (B) or an Elephant (A). Since you won, your opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Leopard, which means they played E (Wolf) or smaller.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played G (Cat) or F (Dog) or E (Wolf) or D (Leopard) or C (Tiger) or B (Lion).\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played F (Dog) or E (Wolf) or D (Leopard) or C (Tiger) or B (Lion) or A (Elephant).\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played D (Leopard) or C (Tiger) or B (Lion) or A (Elephant).\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played C (Tiger) or smaller.\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played E (Wolf) or smaller.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once, let's deduce the most likely sequence of opponent's cards:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played F (Dog).\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played E (Wolf).\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played A (Elephant).\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played C (Tiger).\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played G (Cat).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards were: <<<F, E, A, C, G>>>."
