    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played. Let's go through each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played E (Wolf), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than E (Wolf) to win. Possible pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played G (Cat), and you won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece smaller than G (Cat) to lose. Possible pieces: H (Mouse).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played D (Leopard), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than D (Leopard) to win. Possible pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played B (Lion), and you won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece smaller than B (Lion) to lose. Possible pieces: C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n5. **Round 5: You played A (Elephant), and you won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece smaller than A (Elephant) to lose. Possible pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards based on these possibilities and the fact that each piece can only be used once:\n\n- **Round 2**: The opponent played H (Mouse) since it's the only piece smaller than G (Cat).\n- **Round 1**: The opponent could have played A, B, C, or D. Since H (Mouse) is used in Round 2, and A (Elephant) is not possible in Round 3, the opponent likely played C (Tiger) in Round 1.\n- **Round 3**: The opponent could have played A, B, or C. Since C (Tiger) is used in Round 1, the opponent likely played A (Elephant) in Round 3.\n- **Round 4**: The opponent could have played C, D, E, F, G, or H. Since H (Mouse) is used in Round 2, and C (Tiger) is used in Round 1, the opponent likely played D (Leopard) in Round 4.\n- **Round 5**: The opponent could have played B, C, D, E, F, or G. Since C (Tiger) is used in Round 1, D (Leopard) is used in Round 4, and H (Mouse) is used in Round 2, the opponent likely played B (Lion) in Round 5.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are: <<<C, H, A, D, B>>>."
