    "\nassistant > To deduce the cards your opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the outcomes based on the rules and the cards you played.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Leopard), and you won.**\n   - Your Leopard (D) can win against any piece smaller than or equal to it, except for the Mouse (H) which can only capture the Elephant (A).\n   - Possible opponent pieces: E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), H (Mouse).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played A (Elephant), and you won.**\n   - Your Elephant (A) can win against any piece except the Mouse (H).\n   - Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played E (Wolf), and you lost.**\n   - Your Wolf (E) can be defeated by any piece larger than it.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played F (Dog), and you lost.**\n   - Your Dog (F) can be defeated by any piece larger than it.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n### Deduced Opponent Cards:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played a piece smaller than or equal to D, except H. Possible pieces: E, F, G, H. Since you won, the opponent's piece must be smaller than D, so it could be E, F, G, or H.\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played a piece smaller than A, except H. Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G. Since you won, the opponent's piece must be smaller than A, so it could be B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played a piece larger than E. Possible pieces: A, B, C, D. Since you lost, the opponent's piece must be larger than E, so it could be A, B, C, or D.\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played a piece larger than F. Possible pieces: A, B, C, D, E. Since you lost, the opponent's piece must be larger than F, so it could be A, B, C, D, or E.\n\nNow, let's deduce the exact pieces based on the constraints:\n\n- Since you won in Round 1 and Round 2, the opponent's pieces must be smaller than or equal to D and A, respectively.\n- Since you lost in Round 3 and Round 4, the opponent's pieces must be larger than E and F, respectively.\n\nLet's deduce the exact pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played E, F, G, or H. Since you won, let's assume the opponent played G (Cat).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent could have played B, C, D, E, F, or G. Since you won, let's assume the opponent played D (Leopard).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played A, B, C, or D. Since you lost, let's assume the opponent played C (Tiger).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent could have played A, B, C, D, or E. Since you lost, let's assume the opponent played B (Lion).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: <<<G, D, C, B>>>."
