  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: G, loss.\nRound 2: H, loss.\nRound 3: F, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the opponent's cards, we need to analyze each round based on the rules provided and the outcomes.\n\n### Round Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played G (Cat), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece that is larger than G (Cat) to win.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece that is larger than H (Mouse) to win.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n   - Note: A (Elephant) cannot capture H (Mouse) due to the special rule.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played F (Dog), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece that is larger than F (Dog) to win.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n### Deduction:\n\n- **Intersection of Possible Opponent Pieces:**\n  - From Round 1: A, B, C, D, E, F\n  - From Round 2: B, C, D, E, F, G\n  - From Round 3: A, B, C, D, E\n\nThe common pieces across all rounds are B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), and E (Wolf). However, since the opponent won all rounds, they must have used different pieces each time. Therefore, we need to select three different pieces from the intersection that could have been used in each round.\n\nLet's use Python to find a valid combination of pieces for the opponent:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible opponent pieces for each round\nround1_options = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'}\nround2_options = {'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}\nround3_options = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'}\n\n# Find a valid combination of pieces\nfor perm in permutations(round1_options & round2_options & round3_options, 3):\n    if perm[0] in round1_options and perm[1] in round2_options and perm[2] in round3_options:\n        print(perm)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the opponent's pieces.",
    "The code execution result suggests that the opponent's pieces could be C (Tiger), E (Wolf), and D (Leopard). Let's verify this result with the rules and outcomes of each round:\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played G (Cat), and you lost.**\n   - Opponent played C (Tiger), which is larger than G (Cat).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - Opponent played E (Wolf), which is larger than H (Mouse).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played F (Dog), and you lost.**\n   - Opponent played D (Leopard), which is larger than F (Dog).\n\nThe selected pieces C, E, and D satisfy the conditions for each round, confirming that the opponent could have used these pieces to win each round.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<'C,E,D'>>>"
