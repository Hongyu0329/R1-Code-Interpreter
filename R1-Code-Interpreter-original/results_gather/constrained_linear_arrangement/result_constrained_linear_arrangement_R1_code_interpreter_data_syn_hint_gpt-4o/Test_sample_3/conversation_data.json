  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, draw.\nRound 2: B, draw.\nRound 3: C, loss.\nRound 4: D, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards for a draw: Stick (A) or Worm (D) (since Worm beats Stick, but in a draw, it means the opponent also played Stick)\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards for a draw: Tiger (B) or Chicken (C) (since Chicken beats Tiger, but in a draw, it means the opponent also played Tiger)\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards for a loss: Tiger (B) (since Tiger eats Chicken)\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards for a loss: Chicken (C) (since Chicken eats Worm)\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- From Round 3, the opponent must have played Tiger (B) because you lost with Chicken (C).\n- From Round 4, the opponent must have played Chicken (C) because you lost with Worm (D).\n- From Round 2, since the opponent played Tiger (B) in Round 3, they couldn't have played it again in Round 2. Therefore, they must have played Chicken (C) for a draw with your Tiger (B).\n- From Round 1, since the opponent played Chicken (C) in Round 2 and Tiger (B) in Round 3, they must have played Stick (A) for a draw with your Stick (A).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: Stick (A)\n- Round 2: Chicken (C)\n- Round 3: Tiger (B)\n- Round 4: Chicken (C)\n\nHowever, since the opponent cannot play Chicken (C) twice, let's re-evaluate:\n\n- Round 1: Stick (A)\n- Round 2: Stick (A) (since Chicken (C) was used in Round 4)\n- Round 3: Tiger (B)\n- Round 4: Chicken (C)\n\nThe correct sequence of the opponent's cards is: <<<A,A,B,C>>>."
