  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the pieces we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: B (Lion)\n   - Result: Win\n   - The Lion can only be defeated by an Elephant (A) or a Mouse (H), but since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Lion. Possible pieces: C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: E (Wolf)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - The Wolf can be defeated by A, B, C, or D. Since you lost, the opponent must have played one of these pieces. Possible pieces: A, B, C, D.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: G (Cat)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - The Cat can be defeated by A, B, C, D, E, or F. Since you lost, the opponent must have played one of these pieces. Possible pieces: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: C (Tiger)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - The Tiger can be defeated by A or B. Since you lost, the opponent must have played one of these pieces. Possible pieces: A, B.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Since you won with a Lion, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Lion. The only piece that fits this condition and hasn't been used in later rounds is F (Dog).\n\n- **Round 2:** You lost with a Wolf. The opponent could have played A, B, C, or D. Since B and C are used in later rounds, the opponent must have played D (Leopard).\n\n- **Round 3:** You lost with a Cat. The opponent could have played A, B, C, D, E, or F. Since D and F are used in earlier rounds, and A and B are used in later rounds, the opponent must have played E (Wolf).\n\n- **Round 4:** You lost with a Tiger. The opponent could have played A or B. Since B is used in an earlier round, the opponent must have played A (Elephant).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are: F, D, E, A.\n\n<<<F,D,E,A>>>"
