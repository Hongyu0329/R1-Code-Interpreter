  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: B, draw.\nRound 3: A, draw.\nRound 4: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. The rules of the game and the results of each round will guide us.\n\nLet's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played Chicken (C).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Possible opponent cards: Chicken (C) or Worm (D) because Chicken eats Worm, and if the opponent played Worm, it would be a draw.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played Tiger (B).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Possible opponent cards: Tiger (B) or Stick (A) because Tiger beats Stick, and if the opponent played Stick, it would be a draw.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played Stick (A).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Possible opponent cards: Stick (A) or Chicken (C) because Stick beats Chicken, and if the opponent played Chicken, it would be a draw.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played Worm (D).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Possible opponent cards: Worm (D) or Tiger (B) because Worm beats Tiger, and if the opponent played Tiger, it would be a draw.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that each card is used only once by the opponent. Let's deduce the sequence:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played C or D.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played B or A.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played A or C.\n- From Round 4, the opponent could have played D or B.\n\nTo find a consistent sequence, let's try to assign cards:\n\n- If the opponent played C in Round 1, they cannot play C in Round 3. So, they must have played D in Round 1.\n- If they played D in Round 1, they must have played B in Round 4.\n- If they played B in Round 4, they must have played A in Round 2.\n- If they played A in Round 2, they must have played C in Round 3.\n\nThis gives us a consistent sequence: D, A, C, B.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: B\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<D,A,C,B>>>"
