  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: H, loss.\nRound 2: A, win.\nRound 3: F, draw.\nRound 4: G, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's cards, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - The Mouse can only lose to a Cat (G) or a Dog (F) since it can capture an Elephant (A) and draw with another Mouse (H).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played either F or G.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played A (Elephant), and you won.**\n   - The Elephant can only lose to a Mouse (H) and draw with another Elephant (A).\n   - Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than an Elephant, which could be B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played F (Dog), and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw means the opponent also played a Dog (F).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played G (Cat), and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw means the opponent also played a Cat (G).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- From Round 3 and Round 4, we know the opponent played F and G.\n- In Round 1, the opponent played either F or G. Since F and G are already used in Rounds 3 and 4, the opponent must have played G in Round 1.\n- In Round 2, the opponent played a piece smaller than an Elephant. Since G is used in Round 1 and F in Round 3, the opponent must have played one of B, C, D, or E.\n\nLet's summarize the opponent's cards:\n\n- Round 1: G\n- Round 2: B, C, D, or E\n- Round 3: F\n- Round 4: G\n\nSince the opponent cannot play G twice, let's correct the assumption:\n\n- Round 1: F\n- Round 2: B, C, D, or E\n- Round 3: F\n- Round 4: G\n\nNow, let's finalize the opponent's cards:\n\n- Round 1: F\n- Round 2: B, C, D, or E\n- Round 3: F\n- Round 4: G\n\nSince F is used in Round 1, the opponent must have played G in Round 1. Therefore, the opponent's cards are:\n\n- Round 1: G\n- Round 2: B, C, D, or E\n- Round 3: F\n- Round 4: G\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<G, B, F, G>>>"
