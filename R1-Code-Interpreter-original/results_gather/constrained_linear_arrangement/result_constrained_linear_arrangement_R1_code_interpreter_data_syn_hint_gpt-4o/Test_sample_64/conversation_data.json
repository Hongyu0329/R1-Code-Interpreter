    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce which pieces the opponent played based on the pieces you played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - The Mouse can only be captured by a Cat (G) or a Dog (F) or any larger piece. Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to a Cat (G).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played F (Dog), and you lost.**\n   - The Dog can be captured by any piece larger than or equal to a Leopard (D). Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to a Leopard (D).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played E (Wolf), and you lost.**\n   - The Wolf can be captured by any piece larger than or equal to a Tiger (C). Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to a Tiger (C).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played C (Tiger), and you lost.**\n   - The Tiger can be captured by any piece larger than or equal to a Lion (B). Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to a Lion (B).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- In Round 1, the opponent could have played G, F, E, D, C, B, or A.\n- In Round 2, the opponent could have played D, C, B, or A.\n- In Round 3, the opponent could have played C, B, or A.\n- In Round 4, the opponent could have played B or A.\n\nSince each piece can only be used once, we need to find a combination of pieces that fits all these conditions. Let's try to deduce this logically:\n\n- For Round 4, the opponent must have played B or A. Let's assume they played B.\n- For Round 3, the opponent must have played C, B, or A. Since B is used in Round 4, they must have played A.\n- For Round 2, the opponent must have played D, C, B, or A. Since A and B are used, they must have played C.\n- For Round 1, the opponent must have played G, F, E, D, C, B, or A. Since A, B, and C are used, they must have played D.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are D, C, A, and B.\n\n<<<D,C,A,B>>>"
