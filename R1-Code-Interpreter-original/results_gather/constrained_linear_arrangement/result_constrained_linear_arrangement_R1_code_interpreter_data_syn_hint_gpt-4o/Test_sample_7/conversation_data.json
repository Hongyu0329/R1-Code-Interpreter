  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, loss.\nRound 2: D, draw.\nRound 3: A, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's cards based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played Earth (C) and lost.\n   - According to the rules, Earth (C) loses if it is generated by Fire (B). Therefore, the opponent must have played Fire (B).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played Metal (D) and it was a draw.\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played Metal (D).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played Wood (A) and won.\n   - Wood (A) wins if it overcomes Earth (C). Therefore, the opponent must have played Earth (C).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: D\n- Round 3: C\n\nThus, the list of the opponent's cards is: <<<B,D,C>>>."
