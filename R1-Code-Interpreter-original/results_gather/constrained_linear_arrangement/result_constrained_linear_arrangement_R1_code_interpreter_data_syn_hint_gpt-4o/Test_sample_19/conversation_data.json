  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, draw.\nRound 2: D, draw.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: Stick (A) or Worm (D) (since Worm beats Stick, but in a draw, it must be one step apart or the same)\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: Worm (D) or Chicken (C) (since Chicken beats Worm, but in a draw, it must be one step apart or the same)\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards: Stick (A) (since Stick beats Tiger)\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards: Tiger (B) (since Tiger eats Chicken)\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- From Round 3, we know the opponent played Stick (A).\n- From Round 4, we know the opponent played Tiger (B).\n- In Round 1, the opponent could have played Stick (A) or Worm (D). Since Stick (A) was used in Round 3, the opponent must have played Worm (D) in Round 1.\n- In Round 2, the opponent could have played Worm (D) or Chicken (C). Since Worm (D) was used in Round 1, the opponent must have played Chicken (C) in Round 2.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: Worm (D)\n- Round 2: Chicken (C)\n- Round 3: Stick (A)\n- Round 4: Tiger (B)\n\nThe list of cards played by the opponent is: <<<D,C,A,B>>>"
