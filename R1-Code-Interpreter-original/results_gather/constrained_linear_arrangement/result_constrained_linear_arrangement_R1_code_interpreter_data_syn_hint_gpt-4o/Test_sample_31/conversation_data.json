  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: A, win.\nRound 3: D, loss.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Opponent must have played: Chicken (C)\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Stick beats Tiger (B), so the opponent must have played: Tiger (B)\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Worm loses to Chicken (C), so the opponent must have played: Chicken (C)\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Opponent must have played: Tiger (B)\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: C\n- Round 2: B\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: B\n\nHowever, we notice that the opponent cannot play the same card twice, and there seems to be a contradiction in Round 3. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n- In Round 3, since you played Worm (D) and lost, the opponent must have played Stick (A) because Stick beats Worm.\n\nNow, the corrected list of opponent's cards is:\n\n- Round 1: C\n- Round 2: B\n- Round 3: A\n- Round 4: B\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<C,B,A,B>>>"
