  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: D, draw.\nRound 4: C, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. The rules of the game and the results of each round will guide us in this deduction.\n\nLet's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: B (Tiger)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: B (Tiger) or D (Worm) because Tiger vs. Tiger is a draw, and Tiger vs. Worm is a draw.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: A (Stick)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: A (Stick) or C (Chicken) because Stick vs. Stick is a draw, and Stick vs. Chicken is a draw.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: D (Worm)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: D (Worm) or B (Tiger) because Worm vs. Worm is a draw, and Worm vs. Tiger is a draw.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: C (Chicken)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: C (Chicken) or A (Stick) because Chicken vs. Chicken is a draw, and Chicken vs. Stick is a draw.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that each card is used only once by the opponent, and the combination of cards matches the results of each round.\n\nLet's try to deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- From Round 1 and Round 3, the opponent could have played B or D in either round. Since both rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent must have played B in one round and D in the other.\n- From Round 2 and Round 4, the opponent could have played A or C in either round. Since both rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent must have played A in one round and C in the other.\n\nLet's assign the cards to each round:\n\n- Round 1: Opponent plays B (Tiger)\n- Round 2: Opponent plays A (Stick)\n- Round 3: Opponent plays D (Worm)\n- Round 4: Opponent plays C (Chicken)\n\nThis assignment satisfies the conditions of the game and the results of each round.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards for each round are: <<<B, A, D, C>>>."
