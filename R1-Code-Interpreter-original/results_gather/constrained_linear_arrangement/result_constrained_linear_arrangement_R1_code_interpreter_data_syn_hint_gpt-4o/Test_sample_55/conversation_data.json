  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: F, win.\nRound 2: A, win.\nRound 3: C, draw.\nRound 4: H, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the opponent's cards, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes.\n\n1. **Round 1: F, win.**\n   - You played Dog (F) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Dog (F), which are Cat (G) or Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2: A, win.**\n   - You played Elephant (A) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A), which are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: C, draw.**\n   - You played Tiger (C) and it was a draw. The opponent must have played Tiger (C) as well.\n\n4. **Round 4: H, loss.**\n   - You played Mouse (H) and lost. The opponent must have played a piece larger than Mouse (H), which are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent played either G or H.\n- From Round 2, the opponent played one of B, C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n- From Round 3, the opponent played C.\n- From Round 4, the opponent played one of B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n\nSince the opponent played C in Round 3, we can eliminate C from the possibilities in Rounds 1, 2, and 4.\n\n- Round 1: The opponent played G (since H is not possible due to the win condition).\n- Round 2: The opponent played B (since C is not possible and B is the largest remaining piece that would lose to A).\n- Round 4: The opponent played F (since G was used in Round 1 and F is the largest remaining piece that would win against H).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: G\n- Round 2: B\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: F\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards are: <<<G,B,C,F>>>."
