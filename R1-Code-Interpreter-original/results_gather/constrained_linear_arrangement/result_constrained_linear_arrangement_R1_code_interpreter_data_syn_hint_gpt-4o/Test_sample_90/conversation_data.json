  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, win.\nRound 2: H, loss.\nRound 3: E, draw.\nRound 4: D, loss.\nRound 5: B, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's cards, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes:\n\n1. **Round 1: C, win.**\n   - You played Tiger (C) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Tiger (C), which are Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2: H, loss.**\n   - You played Mouse (H) and lost. This means the opponent must have played a piece larger than Mouse (H), which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n3. **Round 3: E, draw.**\n   - You played Wolf (E) and it was a draw. This means the opponent also played Wolf (E).\n\n4. **Round 4: D, loss.**\n   - You played Leopard (D) and lost. This means the opponent must have played a piece larger than Leopard (D), which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n\n5. **Round 5: B, win.**\n   - You played Lion (B) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Lion (B), which are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Tiger (C). Possible pieces: D, E, F, G, H.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece larger than Mouse (H). Possible pieces: A, B, C, D, E.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Wolf (E).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece larger than Leopard (D). Possible pieces: A, B, C.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Lion (B). Possible pieces: C, D, F, G, H.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once, let's deduce the exact pieces:\n\n- **Round 3** is fixed as E.\n- **Round 1**: Since E is used in Round 3, the opponent could have played D, F, G, or H. However, since H is used in Round 2, the opponent could have played D, F, or G.\n- **Round 2**: Since E is used in Round 3, the opponent could have played A, B, C, or D. However, since D is used in Round 1, the opponent could have played A, B, or C.\n- **Round 4**: Since E is used in Round 3, the opponent could have played A, B, or C. However, since C is used in Round 5, the opponent could have played A or B.\n- **Round 5**: The opponent played C.\n\nNow, let's finalize the opponent's cards:\n\n- **Round 1:** D (since F and G are not possible due to other constraints)\n- **Round 2:** A (since B and C are used in other rounds)\n- **Round 3:** E\n- **Round 4:** B (since A is used in Round 2)\n- **Round 5:** C\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: D, A, E, B, C.\n\n<<<D,A,E,B,C>>>"
