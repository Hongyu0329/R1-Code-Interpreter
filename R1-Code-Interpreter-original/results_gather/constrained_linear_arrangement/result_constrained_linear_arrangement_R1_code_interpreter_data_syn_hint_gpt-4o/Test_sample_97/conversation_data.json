  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3.

    "To deduce the opponent's cards, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes:\n\n1. **Round 1: A, draw.**\n   - You played an Elephant (A). The result was a draw, which means the opponent also played an Elephant (A).\n\n2. **Round 2: E, loss.**\n   - You played a Wolf (E) and lost. The opponent must have played a piece larger than a Wolf. The possible pieces larger than a Wolf are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), and Leopard (D). Since the opponent's Elephant (A) was used in Round 1, the opponent could have played Lion (B), Tiger (C), or Leopard (D).\n\n3. **Round 3: D, win.**\n   - You played a Leopard (D) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Leopard. The possible pieces smaller than a Leopard are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: H, loss.**\n   - You played a Mouse (H) and lost. The opponent must have played a piece larger than a Mouse. The possible pieces larger than a Mouse are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), and Cat (G). Since the opponent's Elephant (A) was used in Round 1, and Leopard (D) was used in Round 3, the opponent could have played Lion (B), Tiger (C), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n5. **Round 5: F, win.**\n   - You played a Dog (F) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Dog. The possible pieces smaller than a Dog are Cat (G) and Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played A (Elephant).\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard).\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played B (Lion), C (Tiger), E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat).\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played G (Cat) or H (Mouse).\n\nTo find a consistent set of cards, let's try to assign the opponent's cards:\n\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played B (Lion).\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played E (Wolf).\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played C (Tiger).\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played G (Cat).\n\nThis assignment satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the opponent's cards were:\n\n<<<A,B,E,C,G>>>"
