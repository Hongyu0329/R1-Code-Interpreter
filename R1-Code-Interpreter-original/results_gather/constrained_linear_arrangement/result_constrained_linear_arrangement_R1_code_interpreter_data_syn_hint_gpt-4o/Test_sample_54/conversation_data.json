  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, loss.\nRound 2: H, loss.\nRound 3: A, loss.\nRound 4: E, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Leopard) and lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than D (Leopard) to win. The possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played H (Mouse) and lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than H (Mouse) to win. The possible pieces are B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat). Note that A (Elephant) cannot capture H (Mouse).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played A (Elephant) and lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played H (Mouse) to win, as the Mouse can capture the Elephant.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played E (Wolf) and it was a draw.**\n   - The opponent must have played E (Wolf) as well, since only identical pieces result in a draw.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played either A, B, or C.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played either B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played H.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played E.\n\nSince the opponent played H in Round 3 and E in Round 4, we can eliminate these options from the other rounds. \n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played either A, B, or C.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played either B, C, D, F, or G.\n\nTo find a consistent set of pieces, we need to ensure that each piece is used only once. Let's try to assign the remaining pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played C (Tiger).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played B (Lion).\n\nThis assignment satisfies all conditions and uses each piece only once.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n- Round 1: C\n- Round 2: B\n- Round 3: H\n- Round 4: E\n\nThe list of opponent's pieces is: <<<C,B,H,E>>>"
