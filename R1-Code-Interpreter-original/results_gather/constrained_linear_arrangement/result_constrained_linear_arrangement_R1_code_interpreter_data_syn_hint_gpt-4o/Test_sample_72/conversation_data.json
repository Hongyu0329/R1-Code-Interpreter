  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, loss.\nRound 2: D, draw.\nRound 3: C, draw.\nRound 4: A, draw.\nRound 5: E, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. We will use the rules of generation and overcoming to determine the possible cards played by the opponent.\n\nLet's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: Played B, Loss**\n   - We played Fire (B) and lost. According to the rules, Fire is generated by Wood (A) and overcome by Water (E). Therefore, the opponent must have played Wood (A).\n\n2. **Round 2: Played D, Draw**\n   - We played Metal (D) and it was a draw. A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played Metal (D).\n\n3. **Round 3: Played C, Draw**\n   - We played Earth (C) and it was a draw. Therefore, the opponent must have played Earth (C).\n\n4. **Round 4: Played A, Draw**\n   - We played Wood (A) and it was a draw. Therefore, the opponent must have played Wood (A).\n\n5. **Round 5: Played E, Win**\n   - We played Water (E) and won. Water overcomes Fire (B), so the opponent must have played Fire (B).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: A\n- Round 2: D\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: A\n- Round 5: B\n\nThe opponent's cards for each round are: A, D, C, A, B.\n\n<<<A,D,C,A,B>>>"
