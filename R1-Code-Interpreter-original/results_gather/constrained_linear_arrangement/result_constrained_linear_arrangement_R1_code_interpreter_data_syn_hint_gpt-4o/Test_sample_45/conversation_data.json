  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: C, loss.\nRound 3: D, loss.\nRound 4: E, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played card B (Fire).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Opponent must have played card B (Fire) as well, since both cards are the same.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played card C (Earth).\n   - Result: Loss.\n   - According to the rules, we lose if our card is generated by the opponent's card. Earth C is generated by Fire B.\n   - Opponent played card B (Fire).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played card D (Metal).\n   - Result: Loss.\n   - Metal D is generated by Earth C.\n   - Opponent played card C (Earth).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played card E (Water).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Opponent must have played card E (Water) as well, since both cards are the same.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: B\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: E\n\nThe opponent's cards are: B, B, C, E.\n\nSince each card can only be used once, we need to ensure that the opponent's card set is valid. The opponent has played B twice, which is not allowed. Let's re-evaluate the rounds to find a valid set of cards.\n\nRe-evaluation:\n- Round 1: B (Draw) -> Opponent played B\n- Round 2: C (Loss) -> Opponent played A (Wood, since Wood generates Earth)\n- Round 3: D (Loss) -> Opponent played C (Earth, since Earth generates Metal)\n- Round 4: E (Draw) -> Opponent played E\n\nNow, the opponent's cards are: B, A, C, E.\n\nLet's verify:\n- Round 1: B vs B -> Draw\n- Round 2: C vs A -> Loss (Wood A generates Earth C)\n- Round 3: D vs C -> Loss (Earth C generates Metal D)\n- Round 4: E vs E -> Draw\n\nThis set of cards is valid. Therefore, the opponent's cards are:\n\n<<<B,A,C,E>>>"
