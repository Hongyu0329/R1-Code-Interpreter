Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: F, loss.**\n   - You played Dog (F) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than Dog (F). The possible pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n2. **Round 2: H, draw.**\n   - You played Mouse (H) and it was a draw. This means the opponent also played Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: D, win.**\n   - You played Leopard (D) and won. This means the opponent played a piece smaller than Leopard (D). The possible pieces are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: A, win.**\n   - You played Elephant (A) and won. According to the rules, the only piece that can capture an Elephant is a Mouse (H), but since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A) and not a Mouse (H). The possible pieces are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than Dog (F). Since the opponent has a Mouse (H) in Round 2, they couldn't have played Mouse (H) in Round 1. The possible pieces are A, B, C, D, or E.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Mouse (H).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Leopard (D). The possible pieces are E, F, G, or H. Since H was used in Round 2, the possible pieces are E, F, or G.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Elephant (A) and not a Mouse (H). The possible pieces are B, C, D, E, F, or G. Since D was used in Round 3, the possible pieces are B, C, E, F, or G.\n\nTo find a consistent set of pieces for the opponent, let's consider the constraints:\n\n- Since Round 2 is a draw with Mouse (H), we know the opponent's Mouse (H) is used.\n- For Round 3, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), which could be E, F, or G.\n- For Round 4, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A) and not a Mouse (H), which could be B, C, E, F, or G.\n\nLet's try to deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played A, B, C, D, or E.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played E, F, or G.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent could have played B, C, E, F, or G.\n\nBy elimination and considering the constraints, let's assume:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played Lion (B).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Wolf (E).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Tiger (C).\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n- Round 1: F vs B (loss for F)\n- Round 2: H vs H (draw)\n- Round 3: D vs E (win for D)\n- Round 4: A vs C (win for A)\n\nThis set of pieces satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the opponent's pieces are:\n\n<<<B,H,E,C>>>"
