  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, loss.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: D, draw.\nRound 4: B, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Stick (A) loses to Worm (D). Therefore, the opponent must have played Worm (D).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - A draw means the opponent also played Chicken (C).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - A draw means the opponent also played Worm (D).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Tiger (B) beats Chicken (C). Therefore, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: D\n- Round 4: C\n\nHowever, we notice that the opponent cannot play the same card twice in different rounds. Let's re-evaluate the rounds where the opponent played the same card:\n\n- In Round 2, the opponent played Chicken (C).\n- In Round 3, the opponent played Worm (D).\n- In Round 4, the opponent played Chicken (C).\n\nSince the opponent cannot play Chicken (C) twice, let's adjust the analysis:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: A (since Worm (D) was already used in Round 1)\n- Round 4: C\n\nNow, let's verify:\n\n- Round 1: You played A, opponent played D (loss for you)\n- Round 2: You played C, opponent played C (draw)\n- Round 3: You played D, opponent played A (draw)\n- Round 4: You played B, opponent played C (win for you)\n\nThis configuration satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the opponent's cards are:\n\n<<<D, C, A, C>>>"
