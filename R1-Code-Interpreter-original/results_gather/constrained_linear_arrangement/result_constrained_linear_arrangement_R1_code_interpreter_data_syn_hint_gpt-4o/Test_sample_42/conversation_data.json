  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, loss.\nRound 2: D, win.\nRound 3: E, draw.\nRound 4: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played card A (Wood).\n   - Result: Loss.\n   - According to the rules, we lose if our card generates the opponent's card. Wood generates Fire. Therefore, the opponent played card B (Fire).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played card D (Metal).\n   - Result: Win.\n   - According to the rules, we win if our card overcomes the opponent's card. Metal overcomes Wood. Therefore, the opponent played card A (Wood).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played card E (Water).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent also played card E (Water).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played card C (Earth).\n   - Result: Loss.\n   - According to the rules, we lose if our card generates the opponent's card. Earth generates Metal. Therefore, the opponent played card D (Metal).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B (Fire)\n- Round 2: A (Wood)\n- Round 3: E (Water)\n- Round 4: D (Metal)\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: B, A, E, D.\n\n<<<B,A,E,D>>>"
