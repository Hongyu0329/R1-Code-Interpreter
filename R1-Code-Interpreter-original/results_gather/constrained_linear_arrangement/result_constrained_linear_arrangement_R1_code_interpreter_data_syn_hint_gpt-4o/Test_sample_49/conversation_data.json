    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played card B (Fire).\n   - Result: Win.\n   - According to the rules, Fire B overcomes Metal D. Therefore, the opponent must have played Metal D.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played card D (Metal).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played Metal D.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played card A (Wood).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played Wood A.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played card E (Water).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played Water E.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: D\n- Round 3: A\n- Round 4: E\n\nThe opponent's cards are: D, D, A, E.\n\nHowever, since each card can only be used once, there seems to be an inconsistency in the deduction. Let's re-evaluate the possible scenarios for each round to ensure each card is used only once.\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played B (Fire), and we won.\n   - Possible opponent's card: D (Metal).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played D (Metal), and it was a draw.\n   - Possible opponent's card: D (Metal).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played A (Wood), and it was a draw.\n   - Possible opponent's card: A (Wood).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played E (Water), and it was a draw.\n   - Possible opponent's card: E (Water).\n\nSince the opponent cannot play the same card twice, let's adjust the deduction:\n\n- Round 1: D (Metal)\n- Round 2: C (Earth) (since D was already used in Round 1)\n- Round 3: A (Wood)\n- Round 4: E (Water)\n\nNow, let's verify if this set of cards satisfies the conditions:\n\n- Round 1: We played B (Fire), opponent played D (Metal) - We win.\n- Round 2: We played D (Metal), opponent played C (Earth) - Draw is not possible, so this needs adjustment.\n- Round 3: We played A (Wood), opponent played A (Wood) - Draw.\n- Round 4: We played E (Water), opponent played E (Water) - Draw.\n\nLet's adjust Round 2 to ensure a draw:\n\n- Round 1: D (Metal)\n- Round 2: D (Metal) (since C was incorrect for a draw)\n- Round 3: A (Wood)\n- Round 4: E (Water)\n\nThis still results in a repeated card, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Round 1: D (Metal)\n- Round 2: B (Fire) (since D was already used in Round 1)\n- Round 3: A (Wood)\n- Round 4: E (Water)\n\nThis configuration does not satisfy the draw condition for Round 2. Let's try another configuration:\n\n- Round 1: D (Metal)\n- Round 2: E (Water) (since D was already used in Round 1)\n- Round 3: A (Wood)\n- Round 4: C (Earth)\n\nThis configuration satisfies all conditions:\n\n- Round 1: We played B (Fire), opponent played D (Metal) - We win.\n- Round 2: We played D (Metal), opponent played E (Water) - Draw.\n- Round 3: We played A (Wood), opponent played A (Wood) - Draw.\n- Round 4: We played E (Water), opponent played C (Earth) - Draw.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards are: D, E, A, C.\n\n<<<D,E,A,C>>>"
