  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards for a draw: Worm (D) or Chicken (C) (since Worm beats Stick, and Chicken eats Worm, both are one step apart in the cycle).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards for a draw: Stick (A) or Worm (D) (since Stick beats Tiger, and Worm beats Stick, both are one step apart in the cycle).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent card for a loss: Stick (A) (since Stick beats Tiger).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent card for a loss: Tiger (B) (since Tiger eats Chicken).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- From Round 3, the opponent must have played Stick (A).\n- From Round 4, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n- For Round 1 and Round 2, the opponent could have played either Worm (D) or Chicken (C) in any order, but since they must use each card once, we can deduce:\n  - If the opponent played Worm (D) in Round 1, they must have played Chicken (C) in Round 2, or vice versa.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards in order are: D, C, A, B.\n\n<<<D,C,A,B>>>"
