  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: C, win.**\n   - You played Tiger (C) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Tiger (C), which are Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2: A, win.**\n   - You played Elephant (A) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A), which are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: G, loss.**\n   - You played Cat (G) and lost. The opponent must have played a piece larger than Cat (G), which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n4. **Round 4: E, win.**\n   - You played Wolf (E) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Wolf (E), which are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n5. **Round 5: D, win.**\n   - You played Leopard (D) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), which are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round by considering the constraints:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played D, E, F, G, or H.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played B, C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played A, B, C, D, or E.\n- From Round 4, the opponent could have played F, G, or H.\n- From Round 5, the opponent could have played E, F, G, or H.\n\nWe need to ensure that each piece is used only once and matches the results of each round. Let's try to assign the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent plays D (Leopard), as it is smaller than C (Tiger).\n- **Round 2:** Opponent plays B (Lion), as it is smaller than A (Elephant).\n- **Round 3:** Opponent plays E (Wolf), as it is larger than G (Cat).\n- **Round 4:** Opponent plays F (Dog), as it is smaller than E (Wolf).\n- **Round 5:** Opponent plays H (Mouse), as it is smaller than D (Leopard).\n\nThis assignment satisfies all the conditions and uses each piece only once. Therefore, the opponent's pieces are:\n\n<<<D,B,E,F,H>>>"
