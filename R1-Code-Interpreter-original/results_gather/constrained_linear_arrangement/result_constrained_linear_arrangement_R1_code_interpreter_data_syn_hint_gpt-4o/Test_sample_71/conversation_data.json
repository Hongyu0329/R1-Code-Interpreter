  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: B, draw.\nRound 4: A, draw.\nRound 5: E, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the rules of generation and overcoming, as well as the results of each round.\n\nLet's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Metal), result is a draw.**\n   - The opponent must have played D (Metal) as well, since it's a draw.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played C (Earth), result is a draw.**\n   - The opponent must have played C (Earth) as well, since it's a draw.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played B (Fire), result is a draw.**\n   - The opponent must have played B (Fire) as well, since it's a draw.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played A (Wood), result is a draw.**\n   - The opponent must have played A (Wood) as well, since it's a draw.\n\n5. **Round 5: You played E (Water), result is a loss.**\n   - According to the rules, Water E is generated by Metal D. Therefore, the opponent must have played D (Metal) to win.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: A\n- Round 5: D\n\nSince the opponent can only use each card once, and they played D twice, we need to adjust the interpretation for the last round. The only card left for the opponent in the last round is E (Water), which overcomes Fire B. Therefore, the opponent must have played B (Fire) in the last round, and you lost because Water E is overcome by Fire B.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: A\n- Round 5: B\n\nHowever, this doesn't match the rules of card usage. Let's re-evaluate the last round:\n\n- Round 5: The opponent must have played C (Earth) because Earth C overcomes Water E, leading to your loss.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of the opponent's cards is:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: A\n- Round 5: C\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<D,C,B,A,C>>>"
