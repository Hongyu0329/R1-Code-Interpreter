  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: F, loss.**\n   - You played Dog (F) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than Dog (F). The possible pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n2. **Round 2: B, win.**\n   - You played Lion (B) and won. This means the opponent played a piece smaller than Lion (B). The possible pieces are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: A, loss.**\n   - You played Elephant (A) and lost. According to the rules, the only piece that can capture an Elephant is a Mouse (H). Therefore, the opponent played Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: H, loss.**\n   - You played Mouse (H) and lost. According to the rules, the only piece that can capture a Mouse is a Cat (G). Therefore, the opponent played Cat (G).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than Dog (F). Since the opponent played Mouse (H) in Round 3 and Cat (G) in Round 4, the remaining larger pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E). However, since the opponent lost in Round 2 with a piece smaller than Lion (B), the opponent could not have played Lion (B) in Round 1. Therefore, the opponent played either Elephant (A), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Lion (B). Since the opponent played Mouse (H) in Round 3 and Cat (G) in Round 4, the remaining smaller pieces are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G). However, since the opponent played Cat (G) in Round 4, the opponent could not have played Cat (G) in Round 2. Therefore, the opponent played either Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), or Dog (F).\n\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Mouse (H).\n\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Cat (G).\n\nTo find the exact pieces for Rounds 1 and 2, we need to consider the constraints and deduce the most likely scenario. Since the opponent has already used Mouse (H) and Cat (G), and considering the possible pieces for Rounds 1 and 2, we can deduce:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played Wolf (E). This is because Wolf (E) is larger than Dog (F) and was not used in any other round.\n\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Dog (F). This is because Dog (F) is smaller than Lion (B) and was not used in any other round.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n- Round 1: E\n- Round 2: F\n- Round 3: H\n- Round 4: G\n\nThus, the list of the opponent's pieces is: <<<E,F,H,G>>>"
