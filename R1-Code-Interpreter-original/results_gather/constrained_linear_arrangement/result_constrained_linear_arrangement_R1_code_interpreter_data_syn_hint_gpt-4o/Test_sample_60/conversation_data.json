    "To deduce the opponent's cards based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Leopard) and lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than D (Leopard) to win. The possible pieces are A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played B (Lion) and won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece smaller than B (Lion) to lose. The possible pieces are C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played C (Tiger) and won.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece smaller than C (Tiger) to lose. The possible pieces are D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played H (Mouse) and lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece larger than H (Mouse) to win. The possible pieces are B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat). However, since the Mouse can capture the Elephant, the opponent could not have played A (Elephant).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played A (Elephant), B (Lion), or C (Tiger).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), or G (Cat).\n\nTo find a consistent set of cards for the opponent, we need to ensure that each card is used only once and matches the results of each round. Let's try to deduce the most likely set of cards:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played A (Elephant) because it's the only card that can beat D (Leopard) and is not used in any other round.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played H (Mouse) because it's the only card that can lose to B (Lion) and is not used in any other round.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played E (Wolf) because it's the only card that can lose to C (Tiger) and is not used in any other round.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played F (Dog) because it's the only card that can beat H (Mouse) and is not used in any other round.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are: A, H, E, F.\n\n<<<A,H,E,F>>>"
