  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: A, draw.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Since all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent must have played cards that either matched ours or were one step apart in the cycle.\n\nLet's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: We played D (Worm), and it was a draw.**\n   - Possible opponent cards: D (Worm) or C (Chicken) because Worm beats Stick, and Chicken eats Worm.\n\n2. **Round 2: We played C (Chicken), and it was a draw.**\n   - Possible opponent cards: C (Chicken) or B (Tiger) because Chicken eats Worm, and Tiger eats Chicken.\n\n3. **Round 3: We played A (Stick), and it was a draw.**\n   - Possible opponent cards: A (Stick) or D (Worm) because Stick beats Tiger, and Worm beats Stick.\n\n4. **Round 4: We played B (Tiger), and it was a draw.**\n   - Possible opponent cards: B (Tiger) or A (Stick) because Tiger eats Chicken, and Stick beats Tiger.\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of cards that the opponent could have played, considering they can only use each card once.\n\nLet's try to deduce the sequence:\n\n- From Round 1, if the opponent played D, then in Round 3, they must have played A.\n- From Round 2, if the opponent played C, then in Round 4, they must have played B.\n\nThis gives us a possible sequence: D, C, A, B.\n\nLet's verify:\n- Round 1: D vs. D (draw)\n- Round 2: C vs. C (draw)\n- Round 3: A vs. A (draw)\n- Round 4: B vs. B (draw)\n\nThis sequence satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the opponent's cards were played in the order: D, C, A, B.\n\n<<<D,C,A,B>>>"
