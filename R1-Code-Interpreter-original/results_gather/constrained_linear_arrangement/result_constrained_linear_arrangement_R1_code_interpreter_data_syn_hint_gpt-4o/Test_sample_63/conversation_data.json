  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's cards based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: G (Cat), loss.**\n   - The Cat (G) can be captured by any piece ranked higher than it, which includes A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), and F (Dog).\n   - Therefore, the opponent could have played any of these pieces: A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n\n2. **Round 2: D (Leopard), loss.**\n   - The Leopard (D) can be captured by any piece ranked higher than it, which includes A (Elephant), B (Lion), and C (Tiger).\n   - Therefore, the opponent could have played any of these pieces: A, B, or C.\n\n3. **Round 3: C (Tiger), loss.**\n   - The Tiger (C) can be captured by any piece ranked higher than it, which includes A (Elephant) and B (Lion).\n   - Therefore, the opponent could have played either A or B.\n\n4. **Round 4: A (Elephant), win.**\n   - The Elephant (A) can only be captured by a Mouse (H), but since you won, the opponent must have played a piece that is ranked lower than the Elephant or the same piece (A) for a draw.\n   - Therefore, the opponent could have played any piece except H (Mouse).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards by considering the constraints from each round:\n\n- From Round 3, the opponent must have played either A or B.\n- From Round 4, since you won with A, the opponent could not have played A, so they must have played B in Round 3.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played A, B, or C. Since B was used in Round 3, they must have played A in Round 2.\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played A, B, C, D, E, or F. Since A and B were used in Rounds 2 and 3, they must have played C in Round 1.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: C\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: Any piece except H (Mouse), but since you won, it must be a piece lower than A, which could be D, E, F, G, or H.\n\nHowever, since the opponent has already used C, A, and B, and you won with A, the opponent must have played a piece lower than A in Round 4. Given the options, let's assume they played D.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards are: <<<C, A, B, D>>>."
