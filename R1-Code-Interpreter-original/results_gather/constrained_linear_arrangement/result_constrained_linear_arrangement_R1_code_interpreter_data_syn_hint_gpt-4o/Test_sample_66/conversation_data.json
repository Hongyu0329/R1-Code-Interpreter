  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: F, loss.\nRound 2: D, draw.\nRound 3: E, win.\nRound 4: H, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: F, loss.**\n   - You played a Dog (F) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece ranked higher than a Dog, which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), or Leopard (D).\n\n2. **Round 2: D, draw.**\n   - You played a Leopard (D) and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played a Leopard (D).\n\n3. **Round 3: E, win.**\n   - You played a Wolf (E) and won. This means the opponent played a piece ranked lower than a Wolf, which are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: H, loss.**\n   - You played a Mouse (H) and lost. According to the rules, the Mouse can only be captured by a Cat (G) or a Dog (F), since the Mouse can capture the Elephant (A).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played either A, B, C, or D. Since D was used in Round 2, the opponent must have played A, B, or C.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played D.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F, G, or H. Since H was used in Round 4, the opponent must have played F or G.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played F or G. Since F was used in Round 3, the opponent must have played G.\n\nNow, let's finalize the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played either A, B, or C.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played D.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played G.\n\nSince the opponent has only one piece left from A, B, or C, and they must have used one of these in Round 1, we can deduce:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played C (Tiger).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F (Dog).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played G (Cat).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<C,D,F,G>>>"
