  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, win.\nRound 2: B, win.\nRound 3: C, win.\nRound 4: A, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's card based on the card we played and the result of each round. Let's break down each round according to the rules:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Worm), and you won.**\n   - Worm beats Stick (A).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played A.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played B (Tiger), and you won.**\n   - Tiger eats Chicken (C).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played C.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played C (Chicken), and you won.**\n   - Chicken eats Worm (D).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played D.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played A (Stick), and you won.**\n   - Stick beats Tiger (B).\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played B.\n\nBased on this analysis, the opponent played the cards in the following order: A, C, D, B.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<A,C,D,B>>>"
