The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3.

    "To deduce the opponent's cards based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: E, win.**\n   - You played Wolf (E) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Wolf (E), which are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2: C, draw.**\n   - You played Tiger (C) and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played Tiger (C).\n\n3. **Round 3: D, win.**\n   - You played Leopard (D) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), which are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: B, win.**\n   - You played Lion (B) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Lion (B), which are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n5. **Round 5: H, loss.**\n   - You played Mouse (H) and lost. This means the opponent must have played a piece larger than Mouse (H), which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Wolf (E), so it could be F, G, or H.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Tiger (C).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), so it could be E, F, G, or H.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Lion (B), so it could be C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece larger than Mouse (H), so it could be A, B, C, D, or E.\n\nConsidering the rules and the fact that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played Dog (F).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Tiger (C).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played Cat (G).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Mouse (H).\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played Elephant (A).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are: F, C, G, H, A.\n\n<<<F,C,G,H,A>>>"
