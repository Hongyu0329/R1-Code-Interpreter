  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the pieces we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: E, loss.**\n   - We played Wolf (E) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than Wolf (E), which could be Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), or Leopard (D).\n\n2. **Round 2: D, win.**\n   - We played Leopard (D) and won. This means the opponent played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), which could be Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: F, loss.**\n   - We played Dog (F) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than Dog (F), which could be Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n4. **Round 4: A, loss.**\n   - We played Elephant (A) and lost. According to the rules, the only piece that can capture an Elephant is a Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Since we lost with Wolf (E), the opponent must have played a piece larger than E. Possible pieces are A, B, C, or D.\n- **Round 2:** We won with Leopard (D), so the opponent played a piece smaller than D. Possible pieces are E, F, G, or H.\n- **Round 3:** We lost with Dog (F), so the opponent played a piece larger than F. Possible pieces are A, B, C, D, or E.\n- **Round 4:** We lost with Elephant (A), so the opponent must have played Mouse (H).\n\nGiven that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played Mouse (H).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece smaller than D and not H, so it could be E, F, or G.\n- **Round 1 and 3:** The opponent played pieces larger than E and F, respectively, and not H.\n\nLet's finalize the deduction:\n\n- **Round 4:** H\n- **Round 2:** G (since E and F are used in other rounds)\n- **Round 1:** C (since A and B are larger than E and not used in Round 3)\n- **Round 3:** B (since A is not used and B is larger than F)\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<C,G,B,H>>>"
