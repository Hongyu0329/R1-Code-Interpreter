  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: A, loss.\nRound 3: E, draw.\nRound 4: C, win.\nRound 5: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played card B (Fire).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Opponent must have played card B (Fire) as well.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played card A (Wood).\n   - Result: Loss.\n   - According to the rules, Wood A loses to Metal D.\n   - Opponent must have played card D (Metal).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played card E (Water).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Opponent must have played card E (Water) as well.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played card C (Earth).\n   - Result: Win.\n   - According to the rules, Earth C overcomes Water E.\n   - Opponent must have played card E (Water).\n\n5. **Round 5:**\n   - We played card D (Metal).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Opponent must have played card D (Metal) as well.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: D\n- Round 3: E\n- Round 4: E\n- Round 5: D\n\nHowever, since each card can only be used once, we need to ensure that the opponent's cards are unique across all rounds. Let's adjust the cards based on the rules and the available cards:\n\n- Round 1: B (Fire)\n- Round 2: D (Metal)\n- Round 3: E (Water)\n- Round 4: A (Wood) - since E was already used in Round 3\n- Round 5: C (Earth) - since D was already used in Round 2\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are: B, D, E, A, C.\n\n<<<B,D,E,A,C>>>"
