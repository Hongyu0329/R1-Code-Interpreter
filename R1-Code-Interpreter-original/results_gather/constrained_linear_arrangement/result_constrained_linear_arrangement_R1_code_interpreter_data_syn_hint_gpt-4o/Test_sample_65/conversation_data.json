  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: G, loss.**\n   - You played a Cat (G) and lost. This means the opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than a Cat. Possible pieces: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\n2. **Round 2: B, win.**\n   - You played a Lion (B) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than a Lion. Possible pieces: C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\n3. **Round 3: A, win.**\n   - You played an Elephant (A) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than an Elephant. Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\n4. **Round 4: E, win.**\n   - You played a Wolf (E) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than a Wolf. Possible pieces: F, G, H.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece higher than G. Since you lost, the opponent's piece could be A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece lower than B. Since you won, the opponent's piece could be C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece lower than A. Since you won, the opponent's piece could be B, C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece lower than E. Since you won, the opponent's piece could be F, G, or H.\n\nConsidering the rules and the fact that each piece can only be used once, we can deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played D (Leopard) since it is higher than G and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent could have played C (Tiger) since it is lower than B and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played B (Lion) since it is lower than A and not used in other rounds.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent could have played F (Dog) since it is lower than E and not used in other rounds.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are: D, C, B, F.\n\n<<<D,C,B,F>>>"
