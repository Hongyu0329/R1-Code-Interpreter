  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, loss.\nRound 2: D, win.\nRound 3: G, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce the opponent's cards based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: A, loss.**\n   - You played an Elephant (A) and lost. According to the rules, the only piece that can defeat an Elephant is a Mouse (H). Therefore, the opponent must have played a Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2: D, win.**\n   - You played a Leopard (D) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece ranked lower than a Leopard. The possible pieces that are lower than a Leopard are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Since the Mouse (H) was already used in Round 1, the opponent could have played E, F, or G. However, since you won, the opponent must have played a piece that is strictly lower than D, which means they played E, F, or G. Since we need to deduce a specific piece, let's assume the opponent played a Wolf (E) for simplicity.\n\n3. **Round 3: G, loss.**\n   - You played a Cat (G) and lost. The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than a Cat. The possible pieces that are higher than a Cat are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), and Leopard (D). Since the opponent has not used any of these pieces yet, they could have played any of them. For simplicity, let's assume the opponent played a Leopard (D).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: H\n- Round 2: E\n- Round 3: D\n\nTherefore, the list of letters representing the opponent's cards is: <<<H,E,D>>>."
