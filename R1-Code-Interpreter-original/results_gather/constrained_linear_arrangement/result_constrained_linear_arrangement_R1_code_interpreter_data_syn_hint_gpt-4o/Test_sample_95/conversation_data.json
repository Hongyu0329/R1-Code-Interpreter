  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the results of each round and the pieces we played. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: F, draw.**\n   - We played Dog (F), and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played Dog (F).\n\n2. **Round 2: C, win.**\n   - We played Tiger (C) and won. This means the opponent played a piece smaller than Tiger (C). The possible pieces are Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: A, loss.**\n   - We played Elephant (A) and lost. This means the opponent played Mouse (H), as the Mouse is the only piece that can capture the Elephant.\n\n4. **Round 4: G, loss.**\n   - We played Cat (G) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than Cat (G). The possible pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n5. **Round 5: D, loss.**\n   - We played Leopard (D) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than Leopard (D). The possible pieces are Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- From Round 1, we know the opponent played F.\n- From Round 3, we know the opponent played H.\n- From Round 2, the opponent played a piece smaller than C. Since F and H are already used, the opponent could have played D, E, or G.\n- From Round 4, the opponent played a piece larger than G. Since F and H are already used, the opponent could have played A, B, C, D, or E.\n- From Round 5, the opponent played a piece larger than D. Since F and H are already used, the opponent could have played A, B, or C.\n\nLet's try to assign the remaining pieces logically:\n\n- For Round 2, the opponent could have played D, E, or G. Since D is larger than G, and E is larger than D, the opponent likely played G to ensure a loss against C.\n- For Round 4, the opponent could have played A, B, C, D, or E. Since D and E are smaller than A, B, and C, and the opponent needs to win, they likely played E.\n- For Round 5, the opponent could have played A, B, or C. Since A is the largest, the opponent likely played A to ensure a win against D.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n- Round 1: F\n- Round 2: G\n- Round 3: H\n- Round 4: E\n- Round 5: A\n\nThe opponent's pieces in order are: F, G, H, E, A.\n\n<<<F,G,H,E,A>>>"
