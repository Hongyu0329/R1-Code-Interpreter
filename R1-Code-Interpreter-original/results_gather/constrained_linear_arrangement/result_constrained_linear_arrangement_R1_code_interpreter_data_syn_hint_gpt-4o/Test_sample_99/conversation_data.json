    "To deduce the opponent's cards based on the rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Round 1: H, loss.**\n   - You played Mouse (H) and lost. According to the rules, the only piece that can defeat the Mouse is the Cat (G) or any larger piece. Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to Cat (G).\n\n2. **Round 2: F, draw.**\n   - You played Dog (F) and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played Dog (F).\n\n3. **Round 3: C, win.**\n   - You played Tiger (C) and won. This means the opponent played a piece smaller than Tiger (C), which could be Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: A, win.**\n   - You played Elephant (A) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A), which could be Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n5. **Round 5: E, win.**\n   - You played Wolf (E) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Wolf (E), which could be Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than or equal to Cat (G). Possible pieces: G, F, E, D, C, B, A.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Dog (F).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Tiger (C). Possible pieces: D, E, F, G, H.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Elephant (A). Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G, H.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played a piece smaller than Wolf (E). Possible pieces: F, G, H.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once, let's deduce the most likely sequence of the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played Lion (B) to defeat Mouse (H).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played Dog (F).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played Leopard (D) and lost to Tiger (C).\n- **Round 4:** The opponent could have played Tiger (C) and lost to Elephant (A).\n- **Round 5:** The opponent could have played Cat (G) and lost to Wolf (E).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are likely: B, F, D, C, G.\n\n<<<B,F,D,C,G>>>"
