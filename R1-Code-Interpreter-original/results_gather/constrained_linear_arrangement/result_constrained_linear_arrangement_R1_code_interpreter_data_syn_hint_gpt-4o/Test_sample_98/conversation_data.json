    "To deduce the opponent's cards, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes:\n\n1. **Round 1: F, loss.**\n   - You played Dog (F) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than Dog (F). Possible pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n2. **Round 2: E, loss.**\n   - You played Wolf (E) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than Wolf (E). Possible pieces: Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n\n3. **Round 3: D, win.**\n   - You played Leopard (D) and won. This means the opponent played a piece smaller than Leopard (D). Possible pieces: Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: C, draw.**\n   - You played Tiger (C) and it was a draw. This means the opponent also played Tiger (C).\n\n5. **Round 5: A, win.**\n   - You played Elephant (A) and won. This means the opponent played a piece smaller than Elephant (A). Possible pieces: Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** Since you lost with Dog (F), the opponent must have played a piece larger than Dog (F). Considering the available pieces and the results of other rounds, the opponent could have played Leopard (D).\n\n- **Round 2:** You lost with Wolf (E), so the opponent must have played a piece larger than Wolf (E). Considering the available pieces and the results of other rounds, the opponent could have played Lion (B).\n\n- **Round 3:** You won with Leopard (D), so the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Leopard (D). Considering the available pieces and the results of other rounds, the opponent could have played Cat (G).\n\n- **Round 4:** It was a draw with Tiger (C), so the opponent also played Tiger (C).\n\n- **Round 5:** You won with Elephant (A), so the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A). Considering the available pieces and the results of other rounds, the opponent could have played Mouse (H).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are: D, B, G, C, H.\n\n<<<D,B,G,C,H>>>"
