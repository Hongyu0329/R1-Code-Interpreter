  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Opponent must have played: Worm (D) (since both players played the same card)\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Opponent must have played: Stick (A) (since both players played the same card)\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent must have played: Stick (A) (since Stick beats Tiger)\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent must have played: Tiger (B) (since Tiger eats Chicken)\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: A\n- Round 4: B\n\nHowever, since each card can only be used once, we need to adjust the sequence to ensure all cards are used exactly once. The opponent's cards should be D, A, B, C in some order. Given the constraints and the results, the correct sequence is:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: B\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: <<<D, A, C, B>>>."
