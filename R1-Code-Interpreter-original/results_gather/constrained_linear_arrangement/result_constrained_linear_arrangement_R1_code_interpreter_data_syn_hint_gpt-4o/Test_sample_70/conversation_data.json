  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. We have the following information:\n\n1. Generation and overcoming rules:\n   - Generation: A -> B, B -> C, C -> D, D -> E, E -> A\n   - Overcoming: A -> C, C -> E, E -> B, B -> D, D -> A\n\n2. Results of each round:\n   - Round 1: We played D, result was a draw.\n   - Round 2: We played A, result was a draw.\n   - Round 3: We played C, result was a draw.\n   - Round 4: We played B, result was a win.\n   - Round 5: We played E, result was a draw.\n\nFor a draw, both players must have played the same card. For a win, our card must have overcome the opponent's card.\n\nLet's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1**: We played D, and it was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played D.\n- **Round 2**: We played A, and it was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played A.\n- **Round 3**: We played C, and it was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played C.\n- **Round 4**: We played B, and we won. B overcomes D, so the opponent played D.\n- **Round 5**: We played E, and it was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played E.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: D\n- Round 5: E\n\nHowever, since each card can only be used once, we need to adjust the opponent's cards to ensure no card is repeated. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: Since D is already used, the opponent must have played E (B overcomes E).\n- Round 5: Since E is already used, the opponent must have played B.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: E\n- Round 5: B\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<D, A, C, E, B>>>"
