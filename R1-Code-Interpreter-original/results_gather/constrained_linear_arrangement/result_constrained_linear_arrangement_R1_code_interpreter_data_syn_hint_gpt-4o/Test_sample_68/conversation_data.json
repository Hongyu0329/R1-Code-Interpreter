  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, win.\nRound 2: G, draw.\nRound 3: E, win.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: A, win.**\n   - You played an Elephant (A) and won. The only piece that can be captured by an Elephant is any piece smaller than an Elephant, except for the Mouse (H), which can capture the Elephant. Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than an Elephant and not a Mouse. Possible pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\n2. **Round 2: G, draw.**\n   - You played a Cat (G) and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played a Cat (G).\n\n3. **Round 3: E, win.**\n   - You played a Wolf (E) and won. The Wolf can capture any piece smaller than or equal to it, except for the Mouse (H). Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than or equal to a Wolf and not a Mouse. Possible pieces: F, G.\n\n4. **Round 4: B, draw.**\n   - You played a Lion (B) and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played a Lion (B).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than an Elephant and not a Mouse. Since the opponent has a Lion (B) in Round 4, they could have played C, D, E, F, or G. However, since they played G in Round 2, they could have played C, D, E, or F. Since you won with E in Round 3, they could have played F or G. Therefore, the opponent played C in Round 1.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played G.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played B.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are: C, G, F, B.\n\n<<<C,G,F,B>>>"
