    "To deduce the opponent's cards based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n1. **Round 1: A, win.**\n   - You played an Elephant (A) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than an Elephant, which is any piece from B to H. However, since the Mouse (H) can capture the Elephant, the opponent could not have played H. Therefore, the opponent played any piece from B to G.\n\n2. **Round 2: G, loss.**\n   - You played a Cat (G) and lost. This means the opponent played a piece larger than a Cat, which is any piece from A to F.\n\n3. **Round 3: F, draw.**\n   - You played a Dog (F) and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played a Dog (F).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played any piece from B to G. However, since the opponent played F in Round 3, they could not have played F in Round 1. Therefore, the opponent played either B, C, D, or E in Round 1.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece larger than G, which is any piece from A to F. Since the opponent played F in Round 3, they could not have played F in Round 2. Therefore, the opponent played either A, B, C, D, or E in Round 2.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F.\n\nTo find a consistent set of cards for the opponent, we need to ensure that each piece is used only once. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If the opponent played B in Round 1, they could play A, C, D, or E in Round 2.\n- If the opponent played C in Round 1, they could play A, B, D, or E in Round 2.\n- If the opponent played D in Round 1, they could play A, B, C, or E in Round 2.\n- If the opponent played E in Round 1, they could play A, B, C, or D in Round 2.\n\nSince the opponent must have played F in Round 3, we can choose any consistent set of cards for the opponent. Let's choose one possibility:\n\n- **Round 1:** C\n- **Round 2:** E\n- **Round 3:** F\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards for each round are C, E, and F.\n\n<<<C,E,F>>>"
