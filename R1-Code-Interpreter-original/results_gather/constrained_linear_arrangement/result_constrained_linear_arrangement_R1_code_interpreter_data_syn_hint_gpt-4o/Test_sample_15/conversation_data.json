  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, loss.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: D, win.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's cards based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played A (Stick), and you lost.**\n   - Stick beats Tiger, so the opponent did not play Tiger.\n   - Worm beats Stick, so the opponent must have played Worm (D).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played C (Chicken), and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw means the opponent also played Chicken (C).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played D (Worm), and you won.**\n   - Worm beats Stick, so the opponent must have played Stick (A).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played B (Tiger), and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw means the opponent also played Tiger (B).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: A\n- Round 4: B\n\nThus, the opponent's cards in order are: D, C, A, B.\n\n<<<D,C,A,B>>>"
