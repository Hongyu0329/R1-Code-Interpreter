  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: H, loss.\nRound 2: B, loss.\nRound 3: E, loss.\nRound 4: D, win.\nRound 5: C, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To deduce the opponent's cards, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the results provided:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - The Mouse can only be captured by a Cat (G) or a Dog (F) or any piece larger than a Mouse except the Elephant (A). Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than a Mouse, but not an Elephant. Possible opponent pieces: G, F, E, D, C, B.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played B (Lion), and you lost.**\n   - The Lion can only be captured by an Elephant (A). Since you lost, the opponent must have played an Elephant. Opponent piece: A.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played E (Wolf), and you lost.**\n   - The Wolf can be captured by any piece larger than it: D, C, B, A. Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than a Wolf. Possible opponent pieces: D, C, B, A.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played D (Leopard), and you won.**\n   - The Leopard can capture any piece smaller than or equal to it: E, F, G, H. Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than or equal to a Leopard. Possible opponent pieces: E, F, G, H.\n\n5. **Round 5: You played C (Tiger), and you won.**\n   - The Tiger can capture any piece smaller than or equal to it: D, E, F, G, H. Since you won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than or equal to a Tiger. Possible opponent pieces: D, E, F, G, H.\n\nNow, let's deduce the exact pieces the opponent played:\n\n- From Round 2, we know the opponent played A.\n- In Round 1, the opponent could have played G, F, E, D, C, B. Since A is already used, and considering the results of other rounds, the opponent likely played G (Cat) to capture your Mouse.\n- In Round 3, the opponent could have played D, C, B, A. Since A is already used, and considering the results of other rounds, the opponent likely played B (Lion) to capture your Wolf.\n- In Round 4, the opponent could have played E, F, G, H. Since G is already used, the opponent likely played F (Dog) or H (Mouse) and lost to your Leopard.\n- In Round 5, the opponent could have played D, E, F, G, H. Since G is already used, and considering the results of other rounds, the opponent likely played E (Wolf) and lost to your Tiger.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n- Round 1: G\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: F\n- Round 5: E\n\nTherefore, the list of opponent's pieces is: <<<G, A, B, F, E>>>."
