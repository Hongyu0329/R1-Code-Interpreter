  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, loss.\nRound 2: A, loss.\nRound 3: B, win.\nRound 4: D, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's card based on the card we played and the result of each round. Let's break down each round according to the rules:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards: Tiger (B) because Tiger eats Chicken.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards: Worm (D) because Worm beats Stick.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Possible opponent cards: Chicken (C) because Tiger eats Chicken.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Possible opponent cards: Stick (A) because Worm beats Stick.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: D\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: A\n\nThus, the opponent's cards in order are: B, D, C, A.\n\n<<<B,D,C,A>>>"
