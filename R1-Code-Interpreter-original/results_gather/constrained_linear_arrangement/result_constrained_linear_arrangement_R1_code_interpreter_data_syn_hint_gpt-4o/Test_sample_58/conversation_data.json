  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, win.\nRound 2: A, win.\nRound 3: E, loss.\nRound 4: F, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the pieces we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Leopard (D)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Opponent's piece must be smaller than Leopard (D), which are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Elephant (A)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Opponent's piece must be smaller than Elephant (A), which are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Wolf (E)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent's piece must be larger than Wolf (E), which are Leopard (D), Tiger (C), Lion (B), or Elephant (A).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Dog (F)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent's piece must be larger than Dog (F), which are Leopard (D), Tiger (C), Lion (B), or Elephant (A).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played E, F, G, or H.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played B, C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played D, C, B, or A.\n- From Round 4, the opponent could have played D, C, B, or A.\n\nWe need to find a combination of pieces that satisfies all these conditions and ensures each piece is used only once.\n\nLet's try to deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- Round 1: The opponent could have played H (Mouse), as it is the smallest piece and would lose to D.\n- Round 2: The opponent could have played G (Cat), as it is smaller than A and would lose.\n- Round 3: The opponent could have played C (Tiger), as it is larger than E and would win.\n- Round 4: The opponent could have played B (Lion), as it is larger than F and would win.\n\nLet's verify this combination:\n\n- Round 1: D vs H (win for D)\n- Round 2: A vs G (win for A)\n- Round 3: E vs C (loss for E)\n- Round 4: F vs B (loss for F)\n\nThis combination satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the opponent's pieces are:\n\n<<<H,G,C,B>>>"
