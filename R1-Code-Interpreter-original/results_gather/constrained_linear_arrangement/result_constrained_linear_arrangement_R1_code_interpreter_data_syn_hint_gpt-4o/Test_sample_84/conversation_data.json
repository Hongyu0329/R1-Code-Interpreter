  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, win.\nRound 2: B, win.\nRound 3: E, win.\nRound 4: G, loss.\nRound 5: A, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the pieces we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: D, win.**\n   - We played Leopard (D) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), which are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2: B, win.**\n   - We played Lion (B) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Lion (B), which are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: E, win.**\n   - We played Wolf (E) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Wolf (E), which are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: G, loss.**\n   - We played Cat (G) and lost. The opponent must have played a piece larger than Cat (G), which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n5. **Round 5: A, win.**\n   - We played Elephant (A) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A), which are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round by considering the constraints:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played E, F, G, or H.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played F, G, or H.\n- From Round 4, the opponent could have played A, B, C, D, or E.\n- From Round 5, the opponent could have played B, C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n\nWe need to ensure that each piece is used only once and matches the results of each round. Let's deduce the opponent's pieces:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played F, G, or H. Let's assume they played F.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent could have played C, D, E, G, or H. Let's assume they played C.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent could have played G or H. Let's assume they played G.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent could have played A, B, C, D, or E. Since C is already used, let's assume they played D.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent could have played B, E, or H. Since D is already used, let's assume they played B.\n\nNow, let's verify if this assignment satisfies all conditions:\n\n- Round 1: D vs F, win for D.\n- Round 2: B vs C, win for B.\n- Round 3: E vs G, win for E.\n- Round 4: G vs D, loss for G.\n- Round 5: A vs B, win for A.\n\nThis assignment satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the opponent's pieces are:\n\n<<<F,C,G,D,B>>>"
