    "To deduce the opponent's cards, we need to analyze each round based on the rules and the outcomes.\n\n### Round 1:\n- **Your Card**: Tiger (C)\n- **Result**: Win\n\nThe Tiger (C) can defeat any piece smaller than itself, which includes Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these pieces.\n\n### Round 2:\n- **Your Card**: Mouse (H)\n- **Result**: Loss\n\nThe Mouse (H) can only defeat the Elephant (A) due to the special rule, but it loses to any other piece. Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece larger than the Mouse, which includes Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), or Cat (G).\n\n### Round 3:\n- **Your Card**: Lion (B)\n- **Result**: Win\n\nThe Lion (B) can defeat any piece smaller than itself, which includes Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Therefore, the opponent must have played one of these pieces.\n\n### Deduction:\n- From Round 1, the opponent played one of [D, E, F, G, H].\n- From Round 2, the opponent played one of [A, B, C, D, E, F, G].\n- From Round 3, the opponent played one of [C, D, E, F, G, H].\n\nNow, let's deduce the most likely combination of cards the opponent played in each round. We need to ensure that each piece is used only once.\n\n1. **Round 1**: The opponent could have played D, E, F, G, or H.\n2. **Round 2**: The opponent could have played A, B, or C (since D, E, F, G, or H would have been used in Round 1).\n3. **Round 3**: The opponent could have played C, D, E, F, G, or H (but not the one used in Round 1).\n\nGiven the constraints, let's try to find a consistent set of cards for the opponent:\n\n- **Round 1**: Let's assume the opponent played Leopard (D).\n- **Round 2**: The opponent could have played Elephant (A) to defeat the Mouse.\n- **Round 3**: The opponent could have played Tiger (C) since it loses to Lion (B).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are likely: D, A, C.\n\n<<<D,A,C>>>"
