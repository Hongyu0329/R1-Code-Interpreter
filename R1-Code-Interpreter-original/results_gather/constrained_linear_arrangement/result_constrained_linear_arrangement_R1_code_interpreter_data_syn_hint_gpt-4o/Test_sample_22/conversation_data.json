  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, loss.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, draw.\nRound 4: D, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played Chicken (C) and lost.**\n   - Chicken (C) loses to Tiger (B) because Tiger eats Chicken.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played Stick (A) and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Stick (A).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played Tiger (B) and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played Worm (D) and lost.**\n   - Worm (D) loses to Chicken (C) because Chicken eats Worm.\n   - Therefore, the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: C\n\nThe opponent's cards for each round are: <<<B, A, B, C>>>."
