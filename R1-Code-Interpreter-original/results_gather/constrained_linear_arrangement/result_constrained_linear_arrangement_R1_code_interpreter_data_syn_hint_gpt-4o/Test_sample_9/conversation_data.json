  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: D, draw.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Since all rounds ended in a draw, the opponent must have played cards that either matched ours or were one step apart in the cycle.\n\nLet's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played Chicken (C).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Possible opponent cards: Chicken (C) or Worm (D) (since Chicken eats Worm).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played Stick (A).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Possible opponent cards: Stick (A) or Tiger (B) (since Stick beats Tiger).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played Worm (D).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Possible opponent cards: Worm (D) or Stick (A) (since Worm beats Stick).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played Tiger (B).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Possible opponent cards: Tiger (B) or Chicken (C) (since Tiger eats Chicken).\n\nNow, we need to assign each card to a round without repeating any card, as each card can only be used once.\n\nLet's try to deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played C or D.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played A or B.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played D or A.\n- From Round 4, the opponent could have played B or C.\n\nWe need to ensure that each card is used exactly once. Let's try to assign the cards:\n\n- Round 1: Opponent plays C.\n- Round 2: Opponent plays A.\n- Round 3: Opponent plays D.\n- Round 4: Opponent plays B.\n\nThis assignment satisfies all conditions and uses each card exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards are: <<<C, A, D, B>>>."
