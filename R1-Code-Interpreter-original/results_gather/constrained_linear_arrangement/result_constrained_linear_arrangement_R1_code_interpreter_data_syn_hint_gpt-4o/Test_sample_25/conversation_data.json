  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: C, draw.\nRound 4: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. The rules of the game are cyclic, and a draw occurs when both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle.\n\nLet's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: B (Tiger)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: B (Tiger) or D (Worm) because B vs. B is a draw, and B vs. D is a draw.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: A (Stick)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: A (Stick) or C (Chicken) because A vs. A is a draw, and A vs. C is a draw.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: C (Chicken)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: C (Chicken) or A (Stick) because C vs. C is a draw, and C vs. A is a draw.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: D (Worm)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: D (Worm) or B (Tiger) because D vs. D is a draw, and D vs. B is a draw.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards by ensuring each card is used only once:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played B or D.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played A or C.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played C or A.\n- From Round 4, the opponent could have played D or B.\n\nTo ensure each card is used once, let's try to assign the cards:\n\n- Round 1: Opponent plays B\n- Round 2: Opponent plays A\n- Round 3: Opponent plays C\n- Round 4: Opponent plays D\n\nThis assignment satisfies all the conditions and uses each card exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the opponent's cards in each round are: B, A, C, D.\n\n<<<'B,A,C,D'>>>"
