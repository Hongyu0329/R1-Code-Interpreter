  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To deduce the opponent's cards based on the given rounds, we need to analyze each round according to the rules of the game.\n\n### Round Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1: G (Cat), loss**\n   - The Cat (G) is defeated by any piece ranked higher than it, which includes A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), and F (Dog).\n   - The opponent could not have played H (Mouse) because the Cat would win against the Mouse.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\n2. **Round 2: B (Lion), loss**\n   - The Lion (B) is defeated by the Elephant (A) or the Mouse (H), due to the special rule where the Mouse can capture the Elephant.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A, H.\n\n3. **Round 3: E (Wolf), win**\n   - The Wolf (E) wins against any piece ranked lower than it, which includes F (Dog), G (Cat), and H (Mouse).\n   - Possible opponent pieces: F, G, H.\n\n### Deduction:\n\n- From Round 2, the opponent must have played either A or H.\n- From Round 3, the opponent must have played either F, G, or H.\n- Since the opponent can only use each piece once, and they won Round 2, they must have played H (Mouse) in Round 2 to defeat the Lion (B).\n- Therefore, in Round 1, the opponent must have played a piece that is higher than G (Cat) and not H (Mouse), which leaves A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n- In Round 3, since the opponent lost, they must have played a piece lower than E (Wolf), which leaves F, G, or H. Since H was used in Round 2, the opponent must have played either F or G.\n\nGiven these deductions, the most logical sequence for the opponent is:\n- Round 1: A (Elephant) or any other higher piece\n- Round 2: H (Mouse)\n- Round 3: F (Dog) or G (Cat)\n\nTo ensure consistency, let's finalize the opponent's cards as:\n- Round 1: A (Elephant)\n- Round 2: H (Mouse)\n- Round 3: F (Dog)\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: <<<A, H, F>>>."
