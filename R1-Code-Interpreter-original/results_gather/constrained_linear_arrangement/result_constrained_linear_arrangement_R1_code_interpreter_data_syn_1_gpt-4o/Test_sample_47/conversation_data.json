  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: B, loss.\nRound 3: D, draw.\nRound 4: A, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played Earth (C).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Opponent must have played Earth (C) as well.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played Fire (B).\n   - Result: Loss.\n   - According to the rules, Fire (B) loses to Water (E) (generation rule).\n   - Opponent must have played Water (E).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played Metal (D).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Opponent must have played Metal (D) as well.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played Wood (A).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - Opponent must have played Wood (A) as well.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: C\n- Round 2: E\n- Round 3: D\n- Round 4: A\n\nThe opponent's cards are C, E, D, A. Since there are five elements and only four rounds, the remaining card that hasn't been played is Fire (B).\n\nThus, the opponent's cards in order of the rounds played are: C, E, D, A, B.\n\n<<<C,E,D,A,B>>>"
