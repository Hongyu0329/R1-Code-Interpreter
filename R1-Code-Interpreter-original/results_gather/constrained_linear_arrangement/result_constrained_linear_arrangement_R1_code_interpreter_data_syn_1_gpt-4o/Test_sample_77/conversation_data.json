  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. We have the following information:\n\n1. Generation and overcoming rules.\n2. The cards we played in each round.\n3. The result of each round.\n\nLet's break down each round:\n\n- **Round 1**: We played D (Metal), and the result was a draw. The opponent must have played D (Metal) as well, since a draw occurs when both players play the same card.\n\n- **Round 2**: We played A (Wood), and the result was a draw. The opponent must have played A (Wood) as well.\n\n- **Round 3**: We played C (Earth), and we won. According to the overcoming rules, C (Earth) overcomes E (Water). Therefore, the opponent must have played E (Water).\n\n- **Round 4**: We played E (Water), and the result was a draw. The opponent must have played E (Water) as well.\n\n- **Round 5**: We played B (Fire), and the result was a draw. The opponent must have played B (Fire) as well.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: E\n- Round 4: E\n- Round 5: B\n\nHowever, since each card can only be used once, we need to ensure that the opponent's cards are unique. Let's adjust the list to reflect this constraint:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: E\n- Round 4: C (since E was already used in Round 3)\n- Round 5: B\n\nNow, let's present the final answer:\n\n<<<D,A,E,C,B>>>"
