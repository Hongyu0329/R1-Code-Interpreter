  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1.

Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: E, draw.\nRound 3: A, draw.\nRound 4: B, draw.\nRound 5: C, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Since all rounds ended in a draw, it means that the opponent played the same card as we did in each round.\n\nLet's break down the rounds:\n\n1. **Round 1**: We played Metal (D), and the result was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played Metal (D).\n2. **Round 2**: We played Water (E), and the result was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played Water (E).\n3. **Round 3**: We played Wood (A), and the result was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played Wood (A).\n4. **Round 4**: We played Fire (B), and the result was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played Fire (B).\n5. **Round 5**: We played Earth (C), and the result was a draw. Therefore, the opponent also played Earth (C).\n\nSince all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent's cards must match ours exactly in each round. Therefore, the sequence of cards played by the opponent is the same as the sequence of cards we played.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our logic is correct.\n\n```python\n# Our cards played in each round\nour_cards = ['D', 'E', 'A', 'B', 'C']\n\n# Results of each round\nresults = ['draw', 'draw', 'draw', 'draw', 'draw']\n\n# Opponent's cards based on the results\nopponent_cards = []\n\n# Since all results are draw, opponent's cards must match ours\nfor i in range(len(our_cards)):\n    if results[i] == 'draw':\n        opponent_cards.append(our_cards[i])\n\nprint(opponent_cards)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the opponent's cards.",
    "The code execution confirms that the opponent played the same cards as we did in each round, resulting in a draw for all rounds. Therefore, the sequence of cards played by the opponent is:\n\n<<<D,E,A,B,C>>>"
