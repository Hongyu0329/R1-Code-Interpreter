  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, loss.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: D, draw.\nRound 4: B, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round according to the rules:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards: Worm (D) because Worm beats Stick.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: Chicken (C) because both players played the same card.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: Worm (D) because both players played the same card.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Possible opponent cards: Chicken (C) because Tiger eats Chicken.\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: D\n- Round 4: C\n\nHowever, the opponent can only use each card once. Therefore, we need to adjust the cards to ensure each card is used only once. Let's use Python to find a valid combination.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Your cards and results\nyour_cards = ['A', 'C', 'D', 'B']\nresults = ['loss', 'draw', 'draw', 'win']\n\n# Possible outcomes based on the rules\noutcomes = {\n    'A': {'win': 'B', 'loss': 'D', 'draw': 'A'},\n    'B': {'win': 'C', 'loss': 'A', 'draw': 'B'},\n    'C': {'win': 'D', 'loss': 'B', 'draw': 'C'},\n    'D': {'win': 'A', 'loss': 'C', 'draw': 'D'}\n}\n\n# Check all permutations of opponent's cards\nfor opponent_cards in permutations(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']):\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(4):\n        if outcomes[your_cards[i]][results[i]] != opponent_cards[i]:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(list(opponent_cards))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct sequence of cards played by the opponent."
