  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, win.\nRound 2: D, loss.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: C, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round according to the rules:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Stick (A) beats Tiger (B)\n   - Opponent must have played: Tiger (B)\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Worm (D) is beaten by Chicken (C)\n   - Opponent must have played: Chicken (C)\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Tiger (B) is beaten by Stick (A)\n   - Opponent must have played: Stick (A)\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Chicken (C) beats Worm (D)\n   - Opponent must have played: Worm (D)\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: A\n- Round 4: D\n\nThus, the sequence of cards played by the opponent is B, C, A, D.\n\n<<<B,C,A,D>>>"
