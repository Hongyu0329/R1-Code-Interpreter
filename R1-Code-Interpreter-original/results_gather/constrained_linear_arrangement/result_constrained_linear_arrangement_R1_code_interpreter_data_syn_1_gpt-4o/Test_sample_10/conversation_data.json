Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: G (Cat), loss.**\n   - The Cat (G) is defeated by any piece ranked higher than it, which includes A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), and F (Dog).\n   - The opponent could not have played H (Mouse) because the Cat would win against the Mouse.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\n2. **Round 2: B (Lion), loss.**\n   - The Lion (B) is defeated by the Elephant (A).\n   - The opponent could not have played C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat), or H (Mouse) because the Lion would win against these.\n   - Possible opponent piece: A.\n\n3. **Round 3: E (Wolf), win.**\n   - The Wolf (E) wins against F (Dog), G (Cat), and H (Mouse).\n   - The opponent could not have played A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), or D (Leopard) because the Wolf would lose against these.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: F, G, H.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent could have played A, B, C, D, E, or F. Since the opponent played A in Round 2, they could not have played A in Round 1. Therefore, the opponent played B, C, D, E, or F.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played A.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F, G, or H. Since the opponent played F in Round 3, they could not have played F in Round 1. Therefore, the opponent played B, C, D, or E in Round 1.\n\nGiven these deductions, let's finalize the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played D (Leopard) because it is the only piece that fits all conditions.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played A (Elephant).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F (Dog).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are D, A, and F.\n\n<<<D,A,F>>>"
