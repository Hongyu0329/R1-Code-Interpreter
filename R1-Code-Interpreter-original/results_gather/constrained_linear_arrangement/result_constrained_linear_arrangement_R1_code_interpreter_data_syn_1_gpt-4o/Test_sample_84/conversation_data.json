Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the pieces we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: D, win.**\n   - We played Leopard (D) and won. This means the opponent must have played a piece smaller than Leopard (D), which are Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n2. **Round 2: B, win.**\n   - We played Lion (B) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Lion (B), which are Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n3. **Round 3: E, win.**\n   - We played Wolf (E) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Wolf (E), which are Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4: G, loss.**\n   - We played Cat (G) and lost. The opponent must have played a piece larger than Cat (G), which are Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), or Wolf (E).\n\n5. **Round 5: A, win.**\n   - We played Elephant (A) and won. The opponent must have played a piece smaller than Elephant (A), which are Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round by considering the constraints and the fact that each piece can only be used once. We will use Python code to help us find a valid combination of opponent's pieces.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Our pieces and results\nour_pieces = ['D', 'B', 'E', 'G', 'A']\nresults = ['win', 'win', 'win', 'loss', 'win']\n\n# Possible opponent pieces for each round based on our results\npossible_opponent_pieces = [\n    ['E', 'F', 'G', 'H'],  # Round 1: D, win\n    ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H'],  # Round 2: B, win\n    ['F', 'G', 'H'],  # Round 3: E, win\n    ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],  # Round 4: G, loss\n    ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']  # Round 5: A, win\n]\n\n# All opponent pieces\nall_opponent_pieces = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']\n\n# Find a valid permutation of opponent pieces\nfor perm in permutations(all_opponent_pieces, 5):\n    if all(perm[i] in possible_opponent_pieces[i] for i in range(5)):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid combination of opponent's pieces that satisfies all the conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a valid sequence of opponent's pieces for each round. Let's interpret the result:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played 'E' (Wolf), which is smaller than our 'D' (Leopard), resulting in our win.\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played 'C' (Tiger), which is smaller than our 'B' (Lion), resulting in our win.\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played 'F' (Dog), which is smaller than our 'E' (Wolf), resulting in our win.\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played 'A' (Elephant), which is larger than our 'G' (Cat), resulting in our loss.\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played 'B' (Lion), which is smaller than our 'A' (Elephant), resulting in our win.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are: <<<E,C,F,A,B>>>."
