  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, win.\nRound 2: E, draw.\nRound 3: H, loss.\nRound 4: D, loss.\nRound 5: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the pieces we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - Our piece: B (Lion)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Opponent's piece must be smaller than B (Lion), so it could be C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - Our piece: E (Wolf)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Opponent's piece must be the same as ours, E (Wolf).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - Our piece: H (Mouse)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent's piece must be larger than H (Mouse), so it could be A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - Our piece: D (Leopard)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent's piece must be larger than D (Leopard), so it could be A, B, or C.\n\n5. **Round 5:**\n   - Our piece: C (Tiger)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent's piece must be larger than C (Tiger), so it must be A or B.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces by considering the constraints:\n\n- From Round 2, we know the opponent played E.\n- From Round 5, the opponent must have played A (Elephant) because B was used in Round 1.\n- From Round 4, the opponent must have played B (Lion) because A was used in Round 5.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played any of A, B, C, D, E, or F, but since E was used in Round 2, B was used in Round 4, and A was used in Round 5, the opponent must have played F (Dog).\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played any of C, D, F, G, or H, but since F was used in Round 3, the opponent must have played C (Tiger).\n\nLet's compile the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- Round 1: C (Tiger)\n- Round 2: E (Wolf)\n- Round 3: F (Dog)\n- Round 4: B (Lion)\n- Round 5: A (Elephant)\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces are: C, E, F, B, A.\n\n<<<C,E,F,B,A>>>"
