  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, draw.\nRound 4: E, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. The rules of generation and overcoming will guide us in determining the possible cards the opponent could have played.\n\nGiven:\n- Round 1: We played D (Metal), result is a draw.\n- Round 2: We played A (Wood), result is a draw.\n- Round 3: We played B (Fire), result is a draw.\n- Round 4: We played E (Water), result is a draw.\n\nSince all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent must have played the same card as us in each round. This is because:\n- A draw occurs when both players play the same card or when no card generates or overcomes the other.\n- Since we know the cards we played, and the result was a draw, the opponent must have played the same card.\n\nLet's verify this by checking the rules:\n1. Round 1: We played D (Metal), opponent must have played D (Metal) for a draw.\n2. Round 2: We played A (Wood), opponent must have played A (Wood) for a draw.\n3. Round 3: We played B (Fire), opponent must have played B (Fire) for a draw.\n4. Round 4: We played E (Water), opponent must have played E (Water) for a draw.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are the same as ours.\n\nLet's compile the final answer:\n\n<<<D,A,B,E>>>"
