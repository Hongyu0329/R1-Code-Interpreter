    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. We have the following information:\n\n1. The cards are Metal (D), Wood (A), Water (E), Fire (B), and Earth (C).\n2. The rules of generation and overcoming are given.\n3. The results of each round are provided.\n\nLet's analyze each round:\n\n- **Round 1**: We played D (Metal), and the result was a draw. The opponent must have played D (Metal) as well.\n- **Round 2**: We played C (Earth), and the result was a draw. The opponent must have played C (Earth) as well.\n- **Round 3**: We played B (Fire), and the result was a draw. The opponent must have played B (Fire) as well.\n- **Round 4**: We played A (Wood), and the result was a draw. The opponent must have played A (Wood) as well.\n- **Round 5**: We played E (Water), and we lost. According to the rules, Water E is generated by Metal D, so the opponent must have played D (Metal).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: A\n- Round 5: D\n\nThe opponent's cards are D, C, B, A, D. However, since each card can only be used once, there must be a mistake in the deduction. Let's re-evaluate the last round:\n\n- **Round 5**: We played E (Water), and we lost. Water E is overcome by Earth C. Therefore, the opponent must have played C (Earth).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards again:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: A\n- Round 5: C\n\nThe opponent's cards are D, C, B, A, C. However, this still doesn't satisfy the condition of each card being used once. Let's re-evaluate the last round again:\n\n- **Round 5**: We played E (Water), and we lost. Water E is overcome by Earth C. Therefore, the opponent must have played C (Earth).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards again:\n\n- Round 1: D\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: A\n- Round 5: C\n\nThe opponent's cards are D, C, B, A, C.
