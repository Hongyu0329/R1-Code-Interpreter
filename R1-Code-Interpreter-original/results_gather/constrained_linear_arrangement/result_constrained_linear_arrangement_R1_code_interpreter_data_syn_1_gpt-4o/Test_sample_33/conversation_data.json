  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, win.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: A, win.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Worm beats Stick (A). Therefore, the opponent must have played Stick (A).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle. Since you played Chicken (C), the opponent must have also played Chicken (C).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Stick beats Tiger (B). Therefore, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - A draw occurs if both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle. Since you played Tiger (B), the opponent must have also played Tiger (B).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: A\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: B\n- Round 4: B\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: A, C, B, B.\n\n<<<A,C,B,B>>>"
