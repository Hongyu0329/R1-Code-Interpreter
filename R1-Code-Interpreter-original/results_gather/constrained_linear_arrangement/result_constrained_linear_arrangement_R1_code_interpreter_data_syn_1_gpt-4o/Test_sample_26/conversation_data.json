  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: A, draw.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Since all rounds ended in a draw, the opponent must have played cards that either matched ours or were one step apart in the cycle.\n\nLet's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Worm), result is draw.**\n   - Possible opponent cards: D (Worm) or C (Chicken) because Worm vs. Worm is a draw, and Worm vs. Chicken is a draw.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played C (Chicken), result is draw.**\n   - Possible opponent cards: C (Chicken) or B (Tiger) because Chicken vs. Chicken is a draw, and Chicken vs. Tiger is a draw.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played A (Stick), result is draw.**\n   - Possible opponent cards: A (Stick) or D (Worm) because Stick vs. Stick is a draw, and Stick vs. Worm is a draw.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played B (Tiger), result is draw.**\n   - Possible opponent cards: B (Tiger) or A (Stick) because Tiger vs. Tiger is a draw, and Tiger vs. Stick is a draw.\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of cards that the opponent could have played, considering each card can only be used once.\n\nLet's use Python to find a valid combination of cards for the opponent:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible cards for each round based on the draw condition\nround_possibilities = [\n    ['D', 'C'],  # Round 1\n    ['C', 'B'],  # Round 2\n    ['A', 'D'],  # Round 3\n    ['B', 'A']   # Round 4\n]\n\n# Generate all permutations of the opponent's cards\nall_permutations = permutations(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])\n\n# Check each permutation to see if it matches the round possibilities\nfor perm in all_permutations:\n    if (perm[0] in round_possibilities[0] and\n        perm[1] in round_possibilities[1] and\n        perm[2] in round_possibilities[2] and\n        perm[3] in round_possibilities[3]):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the opponent's cards.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a valid sequence of cards that the opponent could have played. Based on the analysis and the code output, the opponent played the following cards in each round:\n\n- Round 1: C (Chicken)\n- Round 2: B (Tiger)\n- Round 3: D (Worm)\n- Round 4: A (Stick)\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n\n<<<C,B,D,A>>>"
