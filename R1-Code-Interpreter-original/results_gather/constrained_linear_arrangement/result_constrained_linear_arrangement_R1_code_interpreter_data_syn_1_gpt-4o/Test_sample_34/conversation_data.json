  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: C, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round according to the rules:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: Worm (D) or Chicken (C) (since Worm beats Stick, and Chicken eats Worm, both result in a draw with Worm)\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: Stick (A) or Worm (D) (since Stick beats Tiger, and Worm beats Stick, both result in a draw with Stick)\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards: Stick (A) (since Stick beats Tiger)\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Possible opponent cards: Tiger (B) (since Tiger eats Chicken)\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards by considering the constraints:\n\n- From Round 3, the opponent must have played Stick (A).\n- From Round 4, the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n- From Round 1 and Round 2, the opponent could have played either Worm (D) or Chicken (C) in any order, but since they have already used Stick (A) and Tiger (B), the remaining cards are Worm (D) and Chicken (C).\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the order of the opponent's cards:\n\n- Round 1: Opponent could have played either Worm (D) or Chicken (C).\n- Round 2: Opponent could have played either Stick (A) or Worm (D).\n\nSince the opponent played Stick (A) in Round 3, they couldn't have played it in Round 2. Therefore, in Round 2, they must have played Worm (D), and in Round 1, they must have played Chicken (C).\n\nLet's summarize the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: Chicken (C)\n- Round 2: Worm (D)\n- Round 3: Stick (A)\n- Round 4: Tiger (B)\n\nNow, let's present the final answer:\n\n<<<C,D,A,B>>>"
