  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: G, loss.\nRound 2: H, loss.\nRound 3: F, loss.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To deduce what cards the opponent played in each round, we need to analyze the results based on the rules of the game and the pieces you played.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played G (Cat), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than G (Cat) to win.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than H (Mouse) to win.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf), F (Dog), G (Cat).\n   - Note: A (Elephant) is not possible because the Mouse can capture the Elephant.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played F (Dog), and you lost.**\n   - The opponent must have played a piece ranked higher than F (Dog) to win.\n   - Possible opponent pieces: A (Elephant), B (Lion), C (Tiger), D (Leopard), E (Wolf).\n\n### Deduction:\n\n- From Round 1, the opponent could have played A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n- From Round 2, the opponent could have played B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n- From Round 3, the opponent could have played A, B, C, D, or E.\n\nTo find a consistent set of pieces the opponent could have played, we need to find a combination that fits all rounds without repeating any piece.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the possible combination of opponent pieces for each round.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible pieces for each round based on the analysis\nround1_options = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\nround2_options = ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\nround3_options = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n\n# Generate all permutations of opponent pieces\nall_permutations = permutations(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H'], 3)\n\n# Find a valid permutation that matches the options for each round\nfor perm in all_permutations:\n    if perm[0] in round1_options and perm[1] in round2_options and perm[2] in round3_options:\n        print(perm)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "Based on the code output, the opponent played the following pieces in each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** A (Elephant)\n- **Round 2:** B (Lion)\n- **Round 3:** C (Tiger)\n\nThis combination satisfies the conditions for each round, where the opponent's piece is ranked higher than the piece you played, leading to your loss in each round.\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<A,B,C>>>"
