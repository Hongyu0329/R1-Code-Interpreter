  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: E, draw.\nRound 4: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. The rules of generation and overcoming will guide us in determining the possible cards played by the opponent.\n\nGiven:\n- Generation: A -> B, B -> C, C -> D, D -> E, E -> A\n- Overcoming: A -> C, C -> E, E -> B, B -> D, D -> A\n\nWe played the following cards:\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: E\n- Round 4: D\n\nAll rounds resulted in a draw, which means the opponent played the same card as us in each round.\n\nLet's deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played B, and it was a draw.\n   - Opponent must have played B.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played C, and it was a draw.\n   - Opponent must have played C.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played E, and it was a draw.\n   - Opponent must have played E.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played D, and it was a draw.\n   - Opponent must have played D.\n\nSince all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent played the same cards as us in each round.\n\nNow, let's generate the final answer:\n\n<<<B,C,E,D>>>"
