  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, loss.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: B, loss.\nRound 4: D, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round according to the rules:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent's card must beat Chicken. According to the rules, Tiger (B) beats Chicken. Therefore, the opponent played B.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played the same card, which is Stick (A).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent's card must beat Tiger. According to the rules, Stick (A) beats Tiger. Therefore, the opponent played A.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - For a draw, the opponent must have played the same card, which is Worm (D).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: A\n- Round 4: D\n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the logic is consistent:\n\n```python\n# Define the cards and results\nmy_cards = ['C', 'A', 'B', 'D']\nresults = ['loss', 'draw', 'loss', 'draw']\n\n# Define the rules\nrules = {\n    'A': 'B',  # Stick beats Tiger\n    'B': 'C',  # Tiger beats Chicken\n    'C': 'D',  # Chicken beats Worm\n    'D': 'A'   # Worm beats Stick\n}\n\n# Determine opponent's cards\nopponent_cards = []\n\nfor i, result in enumerate(results):\n    my_card = my_cards[i]\n    if result == 'draw':\n        opponent_cards.append(my_card)\n    elif result == 'loss':\n        # Find the card that beats my card\n        for card, beats in rules.items():\n            if beats == my_card:\n                opponent_cards.append(card)\n                break\n\nprint(opponent_cards)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the opponent's cards.",
    "The code output confirms our deduction of the opponent's cards for each round. Based on the rules and the results of each round, the opponent played the following cards:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: A\n- Round 4: D\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are:\n\n<<<B, A, A, D>>>"
