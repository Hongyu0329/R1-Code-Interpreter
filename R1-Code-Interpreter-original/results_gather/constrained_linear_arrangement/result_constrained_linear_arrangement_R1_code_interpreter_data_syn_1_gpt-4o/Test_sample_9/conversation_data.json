  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: D, draw.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Since all rounds resulted in a draw, the opponent must have played cards that either matched ours or were one step apart in the cycle.\n\nLet's break down the rules and the rounds:\n\n1. **Cycle of cards**: Stick (A) -> Tiger (B) -> Chicken (C) -> Worm (D) -> Stick (A)\n2. **Draw conditions**: \n   - Both players play the same card.\n   - Cards are one step apart in the cycle (e.g., A vs. B, B vs. C, C vs. D, D vs. A).\n\nGiven the rounds:\n- **Round 1**: We played C, and it was a draw. The opponent could have played C (same card) or D (one step apart).\n- **Round 2**: We played A, and it was a draw. The opponent could have played A (same card) or B (one step apart).\n- **Round 3**: We played D, and it was a draw. The opponent could have played D (same card) or A (one step apart).\n- **Round 4**: We played B, and it was a draw. The opponent could have played B (same card) or C (one step apart).\n\nNow, let's use Python to find a valid sequence of cards the opponent could have played, ensuring each card is used only once.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Our cards played in each round\nour_cards = ['C', 'A', 'D', 'B']\n\n# Possible opponent cards for each round based on draw conditions\npossible_opponent_cards = [\n    ['C', 'D'],  # Round 1\n    ['A', 'B'],  # Round 2\n    ['D', 'A'],  # Round 3\n    ['B', 'C']   # Round 4\n]\n\n# Check all permutations of opponent's cards\nfor perm in permutations(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']):\n    if all(perm[i] in possible_opponent_cards[i] for i in range(4)):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will find a valid sequence of cards the opponent could have played. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the opponent played the same cards as you in each round, which is a valid solution given the draw conditions. Since there are no errors, we can conclude that the opponent's card sequence is the same as yours.\n\nTherefore, the opponent played the following cards in each round:\n\n<<<C, A, D, B>>>"
