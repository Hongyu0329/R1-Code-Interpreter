  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, win.\nRound 2: G, loss.\nRound 3: F, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the given rounds and results. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: A, win.**\n   - You played an Elephant (A) and won. The only piece that the Elephant can defeat is any piece except the Mouse (H). Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than the Elephant, which is not a Mouse. Possible opponent pieces: B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\n2. **Round 2: G, loss.**\n   - You played a Cat (G) and lost. The Cat can be defeated by any piece larger than it, which includes A, B, C, D, E, F. Therefore, the opponent must have played a piece larger than a Cat. Possible opponent pieces: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\n3. **Round 3: F, draw.**\n   - You played a Dog (F) and the result was a draw. This means the opponent also played a Dog (F).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece smaller than A and not H. Since F is used in Round 3, the possible pieces are B, C, D, E, G.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played a piece larger than G. Since F is used in Round 3, the possible pieces are A, B, C, D, E.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F.\n\nWe need to find a consistent set of pieces for the opponent that satisfies all conditions. Let's use Python to help us find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible pieces for each round based on the analysis\nround1_possibilities = ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'G']\nround2_possibilities = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\nround3_piece = 'F'\n\n# Generate all permutations of the opponent's pieces\nall_pieces = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']\nopponent_pieces = [p for p in all_pieces if p != round3_piece]\n\n# Check each permutation to find a valid set of pieces\nfor perm in permutations(opponent_pieces, 2):\n    if perm[0] in round1_possibilities and perm[1] in round2_possibilities:\n        print(list(perm) + [round3_piece])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the opponent's pieces.",
    "Based on the code output, we have deduced the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played B (Lion).\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played A (Elephant).\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played F (Dog).\n\nThis set of pieces satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. Therefore, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<B,A,F>>>"
