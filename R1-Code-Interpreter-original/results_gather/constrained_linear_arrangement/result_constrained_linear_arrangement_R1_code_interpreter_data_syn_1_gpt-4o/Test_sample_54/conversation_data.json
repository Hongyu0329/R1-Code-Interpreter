  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, loss.\nRound 2: H, loss.\nRound 3: A, loss.\nRound 4: E, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the pieces we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - Our piece: Leopard (D)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent's piece must be larger than Leopard (D), which means it could be Elephant (A), Lion (B), or Tiger (C).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - Our piece: Mouse (H)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - The Mouse can only be captured by the Cat (G) or another Mouse (H). Since we lost, the opponent must have played Cat (G).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - Our piece: Elephant (A)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - The Elephant can only be captured by a Mouse (H) due to the special rule. Therefore, the opponent must have played Mouse (H).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - Our piece: Wolf (E)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - A draw means the opponent played the same piece, so the opponent must have played Wolf (E).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- Round 1: A, B, or C\n- Round 2: G\n- Round 3: H\n- Round 4: E\n\nSince the opponent can only use each piece once, and we know they used G, H, and E in rounds 2, 3, and 4 respectively, the only remaining piece for round 1 is either A, B, or C. However, since the opponent has already used H in round 3, they cannot use it again in round 1. Therefore, the opponent must have used either A, B, or C in round 1.\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n- Round 1: A, B, or C\n- Round 2: G\n- Round 3: H\n- Round 4: E\n\nSince we need to provide a single answer, let's assume the opponent used the largest possible piece in round 1, which is A (Elephant).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces are:\n\n- Round 1: A\n- Round 2: G\n- Round 3: H\n- Round 4: E\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<A,G,H,E>>>"
