  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: A, win.\nRound 2: G, draw.\nRound 3: E, win.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the pieces we played and the results of each round. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played: A (Elephant)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Opponent's piece: Since we won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than an Elephant. The possible pieces are B, C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played: G (Cat)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Opponent's piece: Since it was a draw, the opponent must have also played a G (Cat).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played: E (Wolf)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Opponent's piece: Since we won, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than a Wolf. The possible pieces are F, G, or H.\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played: B (Lion)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Opponent's piece: Since it was a draw, the opponent must have also played a B (Lion).\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- For Round 1, the opponent could have played any piece smaller than an Elephant. However, since we know the opponent played G in Round 2 and B in Round 4, and they must have played a piece smaller than E in Round 3, the only remaining piece smaller than A that fits is C (Tiger).\n\n- For Round 3, the opponent must have played a piece smaller than E. Since G was used in Round 2 and B in Round 4, the only remaining piece smaller than E is F (Dog).\n\nLet's compile the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- Round 1: C (Tiger)\n- Round 2: G (Cat)\n- Round 3: F (Dog)\n- Round 4: B (Lion)\n\nNow, let's present the answer in the required format:\n\n<<<C,G,F,B>>>"
