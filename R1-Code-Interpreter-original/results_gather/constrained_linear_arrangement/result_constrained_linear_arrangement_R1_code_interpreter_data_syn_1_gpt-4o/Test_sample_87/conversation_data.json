  "question": "Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.\n\nRules:\n1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.\n2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.\n3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.\n4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.\n5. Each piece can only be used once.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: H, loss.\nRound 2: B, loss.\nRound 3: E, loss.\nRound 4: D, win.\nRound 5: C, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's pieces based on the results of each round and the rules of the game. Let's analyze each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played H (Mouse), and you lost.**\n   - The Mouse can only be captured by a Cat (G) or a Dog (F) or any larger piece. Since you lost, the opponent must have played a piece larger than or equal to a Cat. Possible pieces: G, F, E, D, C, B, A.\n\n2. **Round 2: You played B (Lion), and you lost.**\n   - The Lion can only be captured by an Elephant (A). Since you lost, the opponent must have played an Elephant. Opponent's piece: A.\n\n3. **Round 3: You played E (Wolf), and you lost.**\n   - The Wolf can be captured by a Leopard (D), Tiger (C), Lion (B), or Elephant (A). Since the opponent's Elephant (A) was used in Round 2, the opponent must have played D, C, or B. Possible pieces: D, C, B.\n\n4. **Round 4: You played D (Leopard), and you won.**\n   - The Leopard can capture a Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H). Since you won, the opponent must have played one of these smaller pieces. Possible pieces: E, F, G, H.\n\n5. **Round 5: You played C (Tiger), and you won.**\n   - The Tiger can capture a Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), or Mouse (H). Since you won, the opponent must have played one of these smaller pieces. Possible pieces: D, E, F, G, H.\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's pieces for each round:\n\n- **Round 1:** The opponent played a piece larger than or equal to G. Since the opponent's A was used in Round 2, and D, C, B are possible for Round 3, the opponent could have played G, F, or E in Round 1.\n- **Round 2:** The opponent played A.\n- **Round 3:** The opponent played D, C, or B.\n- **Round 4:** The opponent played E, F, G, or H.\n- **Round 5:** The opponent played D, E, F, G, or H.\n\nTo find a consistent set of pieces, let's use Python to check all possibilities:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible pieces for each round\nrounds = [\n    ['G', 'F', 'E'],  # Round 1\n    ['A'],            # Round 2\n    ['D', 'C', 'B'],  # Round 3\n    ['E', 'F', 'G', 'H'],  # Round 4\n    ['D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']  # Round 5\n]\n\n# Generate all permutations of opponent's pieces\nall_pieces = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']\nused_pieces = set()\n\n# Check each permutation\nfor perm in permutations(all_pieces, 5):\n    if (perm[0] in rounds[0] and\n        perm[1] in rounds[1] and\n        perm[2] in rounds[2] and\n        perm[3] in rounds[3] and\n        perm[4] in rounds[4]):\n        used_pieces = perm\n        break\n\nprint(used_pieces)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the opponent's pieces.",
    "Based on the code output, we have determined the opponent's pieces for each round. Let's map these to the rounds:\n\n- **Round 1:** Opponent played E (Wolf).\n- **Round 2:** Opponent played A (Elephant).\n- **Round 3:** Opponent played B (Lion).\n- **Round 4:** Opponent played F (Dog).\n- **Round 5:** Opponent played D (Leopard).\n\nThus, the opponent's pieces for each round are:\n\n<<<E,A,B,F,D>>>"
