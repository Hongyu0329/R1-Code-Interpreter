  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: D, win.\nRound 2: C, draw.\nRound 3: A, loss.\nRound 4: B, win.\nRound 5: E, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the opponent's cards based on the rules of generation and overcoming, as well as the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1: You played D (Metal), and you won.**\n   - Metal D overcomes Wood A. Therefore, the opponent must have played A (Wood).\n\n2. **Round 2: You played C (Earth), and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw means the opponent also played C (Earth).\n\n3. **Round 3: You played A (Wood), and you lost.**\n   - Wood A is generated by Water E. Therefore, the opponent must have played E (Water).\n\n4. **Round 4: You played B (Fire), and you won.**\n   - Fire B overcomes Metal D. Therefore, the opponent must have played D (Metal).\n\n5. **Round 5: You played E (Water), and it was a draw.**\n   - A draw means the opponent also played E (Water).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: A\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: E\n- Round 4: D\n- Round 5: E\n\nSince each card can only be used once, and we have two instances of E, we need to adjust the rounds to ensure each card is used only once. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n- Round 1: A (opponent played A)\n- Round 2: C (opponent played C)\n- Round 3: E (opponent played E)\n- Round 4: D (opponent played D)\n- Round 5: B (opponent played B, since E was already used)\n\nNow, let's finalize the opponent's cards:\n\n- Round 1: A\n- Round 2: C\n- Round 3: E\n- Round 4: D\n- Round 5: B\n\nThus, the opponent's cards are: A, C, E, D, B.\n\n<<<A,C,E,D,B>>>"
