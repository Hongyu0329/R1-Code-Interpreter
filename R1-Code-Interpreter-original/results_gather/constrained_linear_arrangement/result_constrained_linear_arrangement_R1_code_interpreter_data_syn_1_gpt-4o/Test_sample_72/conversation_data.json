  "question": "Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.\nRules:\n1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;\n2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;\n3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.\nKnown:\n1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.\n2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, loss.\nRound 2: D, draw.\nRound 3: C, draw.\nRound 4: A, draw.\nRound 5: E, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer.

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. We will use the rules of generation and overcoming to determine the opponent's cards.\n\nLet's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - We played card B (Fire).\n   - Result: Loss.\n   - According to the rules, we lose if our card is generated by the opponent's card. Fire is generated by Wood. Therefore, the opponent must have played A (Wood).\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - We played card D (Metal).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played D (Metal).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - We played card C (Earth).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played C (Earth).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - We played card A (Wood).\n   - Result: Draw.\n   - A draw occurs when both players play the same card. Therefore, the opponent must have played A (Wood).\n\n5. **Round 5:**\n   - We played card E (Water).\n   - Result: Win.\n   - We win if our card overcomes the opponent's card. Water overcomes Fire. Therefore, the opponent must have played B (Fire).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: A (Wood)\n- Round 2: D (Metal)\n- Round 3: C (Earth)\n- Round 4: A (Wood)\n- Round 5: B (Fire)\n\nThe opponent's cards are: A, D, C, A, B.\n\n<<<A,D,C,A,B>>>"
