  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: B, draw.\nRound 2: A, draw.\nRound 3: D, loss.\nRound 4: C, win.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played B (Tiger), and the result was a draw.\n   - The opponent must have played B (Tiger) as well, since both players playing the same card results in a draw.\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played A (Stick), and the result was a draw.\n   - The opponent must have played A (Stick) as well, since both players playing the same card results in a draw.\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played D (Worm), and you lost.\n   - According to the rules, Worm loses to Chicken (C). Therefore, the opponent must have played C (Chicken).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played C (Chicken), and you won.\n   - Chicken wins against Worm (D). Therefore, the opponent must have played D (Worm).\n\nNow, let's compile the opponent's cards for each round:\n\n- Round 1: B\n- Round 2: A\n- Round 3: C\n- Round 4: D\n\nThus, the opponent's cards in order are B, A, C, D.\n\n<<<B,A,C,D>>>"
