  "question": "Both parties, A and B, are playing a game called \"Stick, Tiger, Chicken.\" Each person has four cards: Stick (A), Tiger (B), Chicken (C), and Worm (D). Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the other's card, and a referee announces the result of each round.\n\nRules:\n1. Stick beats Tiger, Tiger eats Chicken, Chicken eats Worm, Worm beats Stick, and so on in a cycle.\n2. If both players play the same card or cards that are one step apart in the cycle, it is considered a draw.\n\nAssuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.\n\nRounds:\nRound 1: C, draw.\nRound 2: A, win.\nRound 3: D, loss.\nRound 4: B, draw.\n\nUse a list of letters to show your answer. For example, <<<A,B,C>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the cards played by the opponent based on the cards we played and the results of each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - You played: Chicken (C)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: Chicken (C) or Worm (D) (since Chicken vs. Worm is a draw)\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - You played: Stick (A)\n   - Result: Win\n   - Stick beats Tiger (B), so the opponent must have played Tiger (B).\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - You played: Worm (D)\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Worm loses to Chicken (C), so the opponent must have played Chicken (C).\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - You played: Tiger (B)\n   - Result: Draw\n   - Possible opponent cards: Tiger (B) or Stick (A) (since Tiger vs. Stick is a draw)\n\nNow, let's deduce the opponent's cards:\n\n- From Round 2, we know the opponent played Tiger (B).\n- From Round 3, we know the opponent played Chicken (C).\n- For Round 1, the opponent could have played Chicken (C) or Worm (D). Since Chicken (C) is already used in Round 3, the opponent must have played Worm (D) in Round 1.\n- For Round 4, the opponent could have played Tiger (B) or Stick (A). Since Tiger (B) is already used in Round 2, the opponent must have played Stick (A) in Round 4.\n\nThus, the opponent's cards for each round are:\n- Round 1: Worm (D)\n- Round 2: Tiger (B)\n- Round 3: Chicken (C)\n- Round 4: Stick (A)\n\nLet's confirm this deduction with a simple Python script to ensure the logic is consistent:\n\n```python\n# Define the cards and results\nrounds = [\n    ('C', 'draw'),\n    ('A', 'win'),\n    ('D', 'loss'),\n    ('B', 'draw')\n]\n\n# Define the rules\nrules = {\n    'A': 'B',  # Stick beats Tiger\n    'B': 'C',  # Tiger beats Chicken\n    'C': 'D',  # Chicken beats Worm\n    'D': 'A'   # Worm beats Stick\n}\n\n# Deduce opponent's cards\nopponent_cards = []\n\nfor i, (my_card, result) in enumerate(rounds):\n    if result == 'draw':\n        if my_card == 'A':\n            opponent_cards.append('A')\n        elif my_card == 'B':\n            opponent_cards.append('B')\n        elif my_card == 'C':\n            opponent_cards.append('D')\n        elif my_card == 'D':\n            opponent_cards.append('C')\n    elif result == 'win':\n        opponent_cards.append(rules[my_card])\n    elif result == 'loss':\n        for card, beats in rules.items():\n            if beats == my_card:\n                opponent_cards.append(card)\n                break\n\nprint(opponent_cards)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify our deduction.",
