    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"abbabbcaabcab\" in the specified order, repeatedly, until no further operations can be performed. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Check for an even number of 'b's**: If the string contains an even number of 'b's and at least one 'b', append 'ab' at the end.\n2. **Check for prefix 'cb'**: If the string starts with 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n3. **Check for 'bca'**: If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n4. **Check for suffix 'ca'**: If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n5. **Check for prefix 'bc'**: If the string starts with 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n6. **Check for 'abc'**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n\nWe will implement these steps in a loop until no more operations can be applied.\n\n```python\ndef transform_string(s):\n    while True:\n        initial_s = s\n        \n        # Operation 1\n        if s.count('b') % 2 == 0 and 'b' in s:\n            s += 'ab'\n        \n        # Operation 2\n        if s.startswith('cb'):\n            s = 'aa' + s[2:-1]\n        \n        # Operation 3\n        if 'bca' in s:\n            s = s.replace('bca', '', 1)\n        \n        # Operation 4\n        if s.endswith('ca'):\n            s = s[:-1]\n        \n        # Operation 5\n        if s.startswith('bc'):\n            s = s[2:] + 'aa'\n        \n        # Operation 6\n        if 'abc' in s:\n            s = s.replace('abc', 'cab', 1)\n        \n        # If no changes were made, break the loop\n        if s == initial_s:\n            break\n    \n    return s\n\nfinal_string = transform_string(\"abbabbcaabcab\")\nprint(f'<<< \"{final_string}\" >>>')\n```\n\nThis code will apply the operations in the specified order until no further changes can be made, and then print the final string in the required format."
