    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations in sequence to the string \"cbababccac\" until no further operations can be performed. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cbababccac\"\n\n2. **Operation 5**: Check if the string contains 'abc'. It does, so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - Result: \"cbcabccac\"\n\n3. **Operation 6**: Check if the string contains 'bca'. It does, so delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - Result: \"ccaccac\"\n\n4. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'aa'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n5. **Operation 2**: Check if the string suffix is 'bb'. It isn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n6. **Operation 3**: Check if the string prefix is 'ab'. It isn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n7. **Operation 4**: Check if the string prefix is 'bc'. It isn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n8. **Operation 5**: Check if the string contains 'abc'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n9. **Operation 6**: Check if the string contains 'bca'. It doesn't, so no further operations can be performed.\n\nThe final string after performing all operations is \"ccaccac\".\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef transform_string(s):\n    while True:\n        if s.endswith('aa'):\n            s = s[:-2] + 'cc'\n        elif s.endswith('bb'):\n            s = s[:-2]\n        elif s.startswith('ab'):\n            s = 'ca' + s[2:]\n        elif s.startswith('bc'):\n            s = s[2:] + 'aa'\n        elif 'abc' in s:\n            s = s.replace('abc', 'cab', 1)\n        elif 'bca' in s:\n            s = s.replace('bca', '', 1)\n        else:\n            break\n    return s\n\nfinal_string = transform_string(\"cbababccac\")\nprint(f'<<< \"{final_string}\" >>>')\n```\n\nThis code will output the final string after applying all the operations.",
