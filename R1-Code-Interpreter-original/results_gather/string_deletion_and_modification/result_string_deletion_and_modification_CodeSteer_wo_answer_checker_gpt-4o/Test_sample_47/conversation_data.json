    "To solve this problem, we need to repeatedly apply the given operations to the string \"cacbcbbbabbabacc\" until no further operations can be performed. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Check for 'aa' prefix**: If the string starts with 'aa', remove the first character.\n2. **Check for 'cb' prefix**: If the string starts with 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n3. **Check for 'cc' prefix**: If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n4. **Check for 'bb' suffix**: If the string ends with 'bb', delete the last two characters.\n5. **Check for 'acb'**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with 'bca'.\n6. **Check for 'aa' suffix**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n\nWe will implement these steps in a loop until no more operations can be applied.\n\n```python\ndef transform_string(s):\n    while True:\n        original = s\n        if s.startswith('aa'):\n            s = s[1:]\n        elif s.startswith('cb'):\n            s = 'aa' + s[2:-1]\n        elif s.startswith('cc'):\n            s = s[2:]\n        elif s.endswith('bb'):\n            s = s[:-2]\n        elif 'acb' in s:\n            s = s.replace('acb', 'bca', 1)\n        elif s.endswith('aa'):\n            s = s[:-2] + 'cc'\n        \n        # If no changes were made, break the loop\n        if s == original:\n            break\n    return s\n\nfinal_string = transform_string(\"cacbcbbbabbabacc\")\nprint(f'<<< \"{final_string}\" >>>')\n```\n\nThis code will apply the operations in a loop until the string no longer changes, and then print the final result in the specified format."
