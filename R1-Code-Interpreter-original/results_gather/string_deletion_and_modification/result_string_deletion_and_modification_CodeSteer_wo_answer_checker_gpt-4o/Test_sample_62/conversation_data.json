    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the operations on the string \"acbbbcbbaaabbbc\" step by step, following the given rules. We'll continue applying the operations in the specified order until no more operations can be performed.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial string \"acbbbcbbaaabbbc\".\n2. Check each rule in order and apply the first applicable one.\n3. Repeat the process until no rules can be applied.\n4. Output the final string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef process_string(s):\n    while True:\n        if s.startswith('aa'):\n            s = s[1:]\n        elif s.count('b') % 2 == 0 and 'b' in s:\n            s += 'ab'\n        elif s.startswith('ab'):\n            s = 'ca' + s[2:]\n        elif 'acb' in s:\n            s = s.replace('acb', 'bca', 1)\n        elif 'ca' in s[1:]:\n            index = s.find('ca', 1)\n            s = s[:index] + s[index+2:]\n        elif s.startswith('cb'):\n            s = 'aa' + s[2:-1]\n        else:\n            break\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"acbbbcbbaaabbbc\"\nfinal_string = process_string(initial_string)\nprint(f'<<< \"{final_string}\" >>>')\n```\n\nThis code will process the string according to the rules and print the final result in the specified format."
