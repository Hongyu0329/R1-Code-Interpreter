    "To solve this problem, we need to repeatedly apply the given operations to the string until no further operations can be performed. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Check for each operation in order**: We will cycle through the operations in the given order and apply the first applicable operation. If an operation is applied, we start the cycle again from the first operation.\n\n2. **Operations**:\n   - If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.\n   - If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n   - If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.\n   - If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n   - If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n\n3. **Repeat until no operations can be applied**: We will continue applying these operations until none of them can be applied to the string.\n\n4. **Output the final string**: Once no more operations can be applied, we will output the final string.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_string(s):\n    while True:\n        if s.endswith('ba'):\n            s = s[:-2] + 'ab'\n        elif s.startswith('aa'):\n            s = s[1:]\n        elif s.endswith('ac'):\n            s = s[:-2] + 'cb'\n        elif s.startswith('cc'):\n            s = s[2:]\n        elif s.startswith('bc'):\n            s = s[2:] + 'aa'\n        elif s.endswith('cc'):\n            s = 'a' + s[:-2] + 'b'\n        else:\n            break\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"ccccaaaaccbabcbabcbb\"\nfinal_string = transform_string(initial_string)\nprint(f'<<< \"{final_string}\" >>>')\n```\n\nThis code will apply the operations in the specified order until no more operations can be applied, and then it will print the final string in the required format."
