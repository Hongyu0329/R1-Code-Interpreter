    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations in sequence to the string \"cbcbaabacc\" until no further operations can be performed. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cbcbaabacc\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: Check if the string starts with 'bc'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n3. **Operation 2**: Check if the string ends with 'aa'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n4. **Operation 3**: Check if the string starts with 'aa'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n5. **Operation 4**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). It does, so remove the first occurrence found after the first character. The string becomes \"cbcbaabcc\".\n\n6. **Operation 5**: Check if the string starts with 'cb'. It does, so replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character. The string becomes \"aabaabc\".\n\n7. **Operation 6**: Check if the string contains 'acb'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n8. **Operation 1**: Check if the string starts with 'bc'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n9. **Operation 2**: Check if the string ends with 'aa'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n10. **Operation 3**: Check if the string starts with 'aa'. It does, so remove the first character. The string becomes \"abaabc\".\n\n11. **Operation 4**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n12. **Operation 5**: Check if the string starts with 'cb'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n13. **Operation 6**: Check if the string contains 'acb'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n14. **Operation 1**: Check if the string starts with 'bc'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n15. **Operation 2**: Check if the string ends with 'aa'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n16. **Operation 3**: Check if the string starts with 'aa'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n17. **Operation 4**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n18. **Operation 5**: Check if the string starts with 'cb'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\n19. **Operation 6**: Check if the string contains 'acb'. It doesn't, so move to the next operation.\n\nSince no further operations can be performed, the final string is \"abaabc\".\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef transform_string(s):\n    while True:\n        if s.startswith('bc'):\n            s = s[2:] + 'aa'\n        elif s.endswith('aa'):\n            s = s[:-2] + 'cc'\n        elif s.startswith('aa'):\n            s = s[1:]\n        elif 'ca' in s[1:]:\n            index = s.find('ca', 1)\n            s = s[:index] + s[index+2:]\n        elif s.startswith('cb'):\n            s = 'aa' + s[2:-1]\n        elif 'acb' in s:\n            index = s.find('acb')\n            s = s[:index] + 'bca' + s[index+3:]\n        else:\n            break\n    return s\n\nfinal_string = transform_string(\"cbcbaabacc\")\nprint(f'<<< \"{final_string}\" >>>')\n```\n\nThis code will output the final string after applying all the operations."
