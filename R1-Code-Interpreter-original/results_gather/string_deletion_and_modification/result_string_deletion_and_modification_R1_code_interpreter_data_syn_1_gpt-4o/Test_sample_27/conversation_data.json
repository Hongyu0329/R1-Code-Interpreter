    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"cbbcbbaabbcb\" in a loop until no further operations can be performed.

    "The code executed without errors, and the output is \"cacbbaabbcab\". This means that after applying all the operations iteratively until no further changes can be made, the final string is \"cacbbaabbcab\".\n\n<<< \"cacbbaabbcab\" >>>"
