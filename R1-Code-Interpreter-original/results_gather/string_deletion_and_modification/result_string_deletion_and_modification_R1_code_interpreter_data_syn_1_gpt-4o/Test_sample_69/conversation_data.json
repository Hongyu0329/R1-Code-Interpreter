    "The persistent timeout issue indicates that the operations might be causing the string to oscillate between states without reaching a stable condition.

    "The debug output shows that the string is oscillating between two states: \"ababcaccababababab\" and \"ababcaccaababababab\". This indicates that the operations are causing the string to toggle between these two states without reaching a stable condition.\n\nThe issue arises from the combination of operations 5 and 2. When the string has an even number of 'b's, operation 5 appends \"ab\", and if the length exceeds 15, operation 2 removes the middle character, which can lead to the same condition again.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to adjust the logic to prevent this oscillation. One approach is to modify the condition for operation 5 to ensure it doesn't cause an infinite loop.
