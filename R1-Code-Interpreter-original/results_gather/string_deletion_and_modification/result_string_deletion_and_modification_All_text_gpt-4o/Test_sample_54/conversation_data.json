    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"ccbbcabaccacaaccb\" in the specified order, cycling through them until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"ccbbcabaccacaaccb\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: The string length is 17, which is greater than 15. Remove the middle character (9th character, 'a').\n   - Result: \"ccbbcabccacaaccb\"\n\n3. **Operation 2**: The string contains 'ca' after the first character. Remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"ccbbcbccacaaccb\"\n\n4. **Operation 3**: The string contains 'bca'. Remove the first occurrence entirely.\n   - Result: \"ccbbccacaaccb\"\n\n5. **Operation 4**: The string contains 'abc'. This operation is not applicable as 'abc' is not present.\n\n6. **Operation 5**: The string starts with 'cc'. Remove the first two characters.\n   - Result: \"bbccacaaccb\"\n\n7. **Operation 6**: The string ends with 'ca'. This operation is not applicable as the string ends with 'cb'.\n\n8. **Cycle through operations again**:\n\n   - **Operation 1**: The string length is 12, which is not greater than 15. Skip this operation.\n   - **Operation 2**: The string contains 'ca' after the first character. Remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n     - Result: \"bbccaccb\"\n   - **Operation 3**: The string contains 'bca'. This operation is not applicable as 'bca' is not present.\n   - **Operation 4**: The string contains 'abc'. This operation is not applicable as 'abc' is not present.\n   - **Operation 5**: The string does not start with 'cc'. Skip this operation.\n   - **Operation 6**: The string does not end with 'ca'. Skip this operation.\n\n9. **Cycle through operations again**:\n\n   - **Operation 1**: The string length is 8, which is not greater than 15. Skip this operation.\n   - **Operation 2**: The string contains 'ca' after the first character. Remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n     - Result: \"bbcccb\"\n   - **Operation 3**: The string contains 'bca'. This operation is not applicable as 'bca' is not present.\n   - **Operation 4**: The string contains 'abc'. This operation is not applicable as 'abc' is not present.\n   - **Operation 5**: The string does not start with 'cc'. Skip this operation.\n   - **Operation 6**: The string does not end with 'ca'. Skip this operation.\n\n10. **Cycle through operations again**:\n\n    - **Operation 1**: The string length is 6, which is not greater than 15. Skip this operation.\n    - **Operation 2**: The string does not contain 'ca' after the first character. Skip this operation.\n    - **Operation 3**: The string contains 'bca'. This operation is not applicable as 'bca' is not present.\n    - **Operation 4**: The string contains 'abc'. This operation is not applicable as 'abc' is not present.\n    - **Operation 5**: The string does not start with 'cc'. Skip this operation.\n    - **Operation 6**: The string does not end with 'ca'. Skip this operation.\n\nNo further operations can be performed. The final string is:\n\n<<< \"bbcccb\" >>>"
