    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"bbcaaccbbccbbbaa\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"bbcaaccbbccbbbaa\"\n\n2. **Operation 6**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - \"bbcaaccbbccbbbaa\" -> \"bcaaccbbccbbbaa\"\n\n3. **Operation 4**: If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - \"bcaaccbbccbbbaa\" -> \"aaccbbccbbbaaaa\"\n\n4. **Operation 5**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n   - \"aaccbbccbbbaaaa\" -> \"aaccbbccbbbaacc\"\n\n5. **Operation 3**: If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.\n   - \"aaccbbccbbbaacc\" -> \"aaccbbccbbbacb\"\n\n6. **Operation 2**: If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - No 'cb' prefix, so skip this step.\n\n7. **Operation 1**: If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n   - No 'ab' prefix, so skip this step.\n\n8. **Operation 6**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - No 'bb' prefix, so skip this step.\n\n9. **Operation 4**: If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - No 'bc' prefix, so skip this step.\n\n10. **Operation 5**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n    - No 'aa' suffix, so skip this step.\n\n11. **Operation 3**: If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.\n    - No 'ac' suffix, so skip this step.\n\n12. **Operation 2**: If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n    - No 'cb' prefix, so skip this step.\n\n13. **Operation 1**: If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n    - No 'ab' prefix, so skip this step.\n\nSince no further operations can be performed, the final string is:\n\n<<< \"aaccbbccbbbacb\" >>>"
