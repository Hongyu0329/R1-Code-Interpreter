    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"cbcbabcabcacbba\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cbcbabcabcacbba\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - The string \"cbcbabcabcacbba\" contains 'abc' starting at index 4. Replace 'abc' with 'cab'.\n   - New string: \"cbcbcababcacbba\"\n\n3. **Operation 2**: If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - The string \"cbcbcababcacbba\" contains 'bca' starting at index 5. Delete 'bca'.\n   - New string: \"cbccabacbba\"\n\n4. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - The string \"cbccabacbba\" contains 'abc' starting at index 6. Replace 'abc' with 'cab'.\n   - New string: \"cbccacabbba\"\n\n5. **Operation 3**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n   - The string \"cbccacabbba\" contains 'acb' starting at index 4. Replace 'acb' with 'bca'.\n   - New string: \"cbccbabbba\"\n\n6. **Operation 4**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not start with 'ca'. Skip this operation.\n\n7. **Operation 5**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n   - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not end with 'cc'. Skip this operation.\n\n8. **Operation 6**: If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n   - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not start with 'ab'. Skip this operation.\n\n9. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not contain 'abc'. Skip this operation.\n\n10. **Operation 2**: If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n    - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not contain 'bca'. Skip this operation.\n\n11. **Operation 3**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n    - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not contain 'acb'. Skip this operation.\n\n12. **Operation 4**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n    - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not start with 'ca'. Skip this operation.\n\n13. **Operation 5**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n    - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not end with 'cc'. Skip this operation.\n\n14. **Operation 6**: If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n    - The string \"cbccbabbba\" does not start with 'ab'. Skip this operation.\n\nSince no further operations can be performed, the final string is:\n\n<<< \"cbccbabbba\" >>>"
