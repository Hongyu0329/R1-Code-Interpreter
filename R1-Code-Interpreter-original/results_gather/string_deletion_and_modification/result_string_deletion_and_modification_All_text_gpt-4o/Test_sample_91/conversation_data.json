    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"aabccbccbbccbb\" step by step until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"aabccbccbbccbb\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n   - The string starts with 'aa', so we remove the first character.\n   - New String: \"abccbccbbccbb\"\n\n3. **Operation 1**: If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n   - The string does not start with 'aa', so we move to the next operation.\n\n4. **Operation 2**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n   - The string does not end with 'aa', so we move to the next operation.\n\n5. **Operation 3**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - The string does not start with 'ca', so we move to the next operation.\n\n6. **Operation 4**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n   - The string does not end with 'cc', so we move to the next operation.\n\n7. **Operation 5**: If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.\n   - The string ends with 'bb', so we delete the last two characters.\n   - New String: \"abccbccbbcc\"\n\n8. **Operation 1**: If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n   - The string does not start with 'aa', so we move to the next operation.\n\n9. **Operation 2**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n   - The string does not end with 'aa', so we move to the next operation.\n\n10. **Operation 3**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n    - The string does not start with 'ca', so we move to the next operation.\n\n11. **Operation 4**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n    - The string ends with 'cc', so we replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n    - New String: \"abccbccbbb\"\n\n12. **Operation 1**: If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n    - The string does not start with 'aa', so we move to the next operation.\n\n13. **Operation 2**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n    - The string does not end with 'aa', so we move to the next operation.\n\n14. **Operation 3**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n    - The string does not start with 'ca', so we move to the next operation.\n\n15. **Operation 4**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n    - The string does not end with 'cc', so we move to the next operation.\n\n16. **Operation 5**: If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.\n    - The string ends with 'bb', so we delete the last two characters.\n    - New String: \"abccbccb\"\n\n17. **Operation 1**: If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n    - The string does not start with 'aa', so we move to the next operation.\n\n18. **Operation 2**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n    - The string does not end with 'aa', so we move to the next operation.\n\n19. **Operation 3**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n    - The string does not start with 'ca', so we move to the next operation.\n\n20. **Operation 4**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n    - The string does not end with 'cc', so we move to the next operation.\n\n21. **Operation 5**: If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.\n    - The string does not end with 'bb', so we move to the next operation.\n\n22. **Operation 6**: If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n    - The string does not end with 'ca', so we move to the next operation.\n\nSince no further operations can be performed, the final string is:\n\n<<< \"abccbccb\" >>>"
