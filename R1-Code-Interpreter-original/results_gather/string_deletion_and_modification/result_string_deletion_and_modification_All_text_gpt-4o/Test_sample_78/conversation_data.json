    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"cbcbaabacc\" step by step until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cbcbaabacc\"\n\n2. **Operation 5**: The string prefix is 'cb', so replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - Result: \"aacbaabac\"\n\n3. **Operation 3**: The string prefix is 'aa', so remove the first character.\n   - Result: \"acbaabac\"\n\n4. **Operation 6**: The string contains 'acb', so replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n   - Result: \"bcaaabac\"\n\n5. **Operation 1**: The string prefix is 'bc', so delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - Result: \"aaabacaa\"\n\n6. **Operation 3**: The string prefix is 'aa', so remove the first character.\n   - Result: \"aabacaa\"\n\n7. **Operation 3**: The string prefix is 'aa', so remove the first character.\n   - Result: \"abacaa\"\n\n8. **Operation 4**: The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"abaca\"\n\n9. **Operation 4**: The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"abaa\"\n\n10. **Operation 2**: The string ends with 'aa', so replace it with 'cc'.\n    - Result: \"abcc\"\n\n11. **No further operations can be performed**: None of the conditions for operations 1-6 are met.\n\nThe final string after performing all operations is:\n\n<<< \"abcc\" >>>"
