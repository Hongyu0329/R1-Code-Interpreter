    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"ccaabbcaccbbcbbbaaa\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's go through the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"ccaabbcaccbbcbbbaaa\"\n\n2. **Operation 4**: The string starts with 'cc', so we remove the first two characters.\n   - Result: \"aabbcaccbbcbbbaaa\"\n\n3. **Operation 6**: The string starts with 'aa', which doesn't match 'bc', so we skip this operation.\n\n4. **Operation 1**: The string contains 'abc', so we replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - Result: \"aacabccbbcbbbaaa\"\n\n5. **Operation 2**: The string contains 'bca', but not 'bca' as a substring, so we skip this operation.\n\n6. **Operation 3**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (6 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n   -
