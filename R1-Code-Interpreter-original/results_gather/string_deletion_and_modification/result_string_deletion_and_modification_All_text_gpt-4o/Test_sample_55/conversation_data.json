    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"cbbaacbabccbcbba\" in the specified order, cycling through them until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cbbaacbabccbcbba\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 2**: The string contains 'acb' at position 4-6. Replace 'acb' with 'bca'.\n   - New String: \"cbbabcabccbcbba\"\n\n4. **Operation 3**: The string does not end with 'bb', so no change.\n\n5. **Operation 4**: The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n6. **Operation 5**: The string contains 'abc' at position 3-5. Replace 'abc' with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcabcabcbcbba\"\n\n7. **Operation 6**: The string ends with 'ba'. Replace 'ba' with 'ab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcabcabcbcbab\"\n\n8. **Cycle through operations again**:\n\n   - **Operation 1**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n   \n   - **Operation 2**: The string contains 'acb' at position 5-7.
