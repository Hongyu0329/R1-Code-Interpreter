    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"bbaaacccaaccabbca\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's go through the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"bbaaacccaaccabbca\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'bb'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n3. **Operation 2**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). The string contains 'ca' at position 12 (after the first character), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character:\n   - New String: \"bbaaacccaaccabb\"\n\n4. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'bb'. It does, so delete the last two characters:\n   - New String: \"bbaaacccaacca\"\n\n5. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'bb'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n6. **Operation 2**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). The string contains 'ca' at position 10 (after the first character), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character:\n   - New String: \"bbaaacccaaca\"\n\n7. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'bb'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n8. **Operation 2**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). The string contains 'ca' at position 9 (after the first character), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character:\n   - New String: \"bbaaacccaa\"\n\n9. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'bb'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n10. **Operation 2**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). The string contains 'ca' at position 8 (after the first character), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character:\n    - New String: \"bbaaaccca\"\n\n11. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'bb'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n12. **Operation 2**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). The string contains 'ca' at position 7 (after the first character), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character:\n    - New String: \"bbaaaccc\"\n\n13. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'bb'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n14. **Operation 2**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n15. **Operation 3**: Check if the string ends with 'cc'. It does, so replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start:\n    - New String: \"abbaaacb\"\n\n16. **Operation 1**: Check if the string ends with 'bb'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n17. **Operation 2**: Check if the string contains 'ca' (not at the start). It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n18. **Operation 3**: Check if the string ends with 'cc'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n19. **Operation 4**: Check if the string ends with 'ac'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n20. **Operation 5**: Check if the string ends with 'ca'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\n21. **Operation 6**: Check if the string starts with 'cb'. It does not, so move to the next operation.\n\nSince no further operations can be performed, the final string is:\n\n<<< \"abbaaacb\" >>>"
