    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"cbbcbbaabbcb\" step by step until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cbbcbbaabbcb\"\n\n2. **Operation 6**: The string prefix is 'cb', so replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - Result: \"aabbbaabbc\"\n\n3. **Operation 2**: The string prefix is 'aa', so remove the first character.\n   - Result: \"abbbaabbc\"\n\n4. **Operation 5**: The string prefix is 'ab', so replace it with 'ca'.\n   - Result: \"cbaabbc\"\n\n5. **Operation 6**: The string prefix is 'cb', so replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - Result: \"aaabb\"\n\n6. **Operation 2**: The string prefix is 'aa', so remove the first character.\n   - Result: \"aabb\"\n\n7. **Operation 2**: The string prefix is 'aa', so remove the first character.\n   - Result: \"abb\"\n\n8. **Operation 5**: The string prefix is 'ab', so replace it with 'ca'.\n   - Result: \"cabb\"\n\n9. **Operation 6**: The string prefix is 'cb', so replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - Result: \"aab\"\n\n10. **Operation 2**: The string prefix is 'aa', so remove the first character.\n    - Result: \"ab\"\n\n11. **Operation 5**: The string prefix is 'ab', so replace it with 'ca'.\n    - Result: \"ca\"\n\n12. **No further operations can be performed**: The string does not meet any of the conditions for the operations.\n\nThe final string after performing all operations is:\n\n<<< \"ca\" >>>"
