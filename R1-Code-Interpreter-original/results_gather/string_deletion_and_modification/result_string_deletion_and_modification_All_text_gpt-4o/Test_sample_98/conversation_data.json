    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"bacccaccbca\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's go through the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"bacccaccbca\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: Check for 'bca'\n   - The string contains 'bca' at the end. Remove it.\n   - New String: \"bacccacc\"\n\n3. **Operation 2**: Check for suffix 'cc'\n   - The string ends with 'cc'. Replace 'cc' with 'b' and prepend 'a'.\n   - New String: \"abacccab\"\n\n4. **Operation 3**: Check for prefix 'ac'\n   - The string does not start with 'ac'. Skip this operation.\n\n5. **Operation 4**: Check for prefix 'ab'\n   - The string starts with 'ab'. Replace 'ab' with 'ca'.\n   - New String: \"caccab\"\n\n6. **Operation 5**: Check for 'ca' not at the start\n   - The string contains 'ca' starting from the second character. Remove it.\n   - New String: \"ccab\"\n\n7. **Operation 6**: Check for prefix 'bc'\n   - The string does not start with 'bc'. Skip this operation.\n\n8. **Operation 1**: Check for 'bca'\n   - The string does not contain 'bca'. Skip this operation.\n\n9. **Operation 2**: Check for suffix 'cc'\n   - The string starts with 'cc'. Replace 'cc' with 'b' and prepend 'a'.\n   - New String: \"ab\"\n\n10. **Operation 3**: Check for prefix 'ac'\n    - The string does not start with 'ac'. Skip this operation.\n\n11. **Operation 4**: Check for prefix 'ab'\n    - The string starts with 'ab'. Replace 'ab' with 'ca'.\n    - New String: \"ca\"\n\n12. **Operation 5**: Check for 'ca' not at the start\n    - The string does not contain 'ca' after the first character. Skip this operation.\n\n13. **Operation 6**: Check for prefix 'bc'\n    - The string does not start with 'bc'. Skip this operation.\n\n14. **Operation 1**: Check for 'bca'\n    - The string does not contain 'bca'. Skip this operation.\n\n15. **Operation 2**: Check for suffix 'cc'\n    - The string does not end with 'cc'. Skip this operation.\n\n16. **Operation 3**: Check for prefix 'ac'\n    - The string does not start with 'ac'. Skip this operation.\n\n17. **Operation 4**: Check for prefix 'ab'\n    - The string does not start with 'ab'. Skip this operation.\n\n18. **Operation 5**: Check for 'ca' not at the start\n    - The string does not contain 'ca' after the first character. Skip this operation.\n\n19. **Operation 6**: Check for prefix 'bc'\n    - The string does not start with 'bc'. Skip this operation.\n\nAt this point, no further operations can be performed. The final string is:\n\n<<< \"ca\" >>>"
