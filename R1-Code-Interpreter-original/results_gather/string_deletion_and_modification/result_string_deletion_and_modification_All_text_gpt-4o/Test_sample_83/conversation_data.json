    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"abbabbcaabcab\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"abbabbcaabcab\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: Check if the string contains an even number of 'b's (and at least one 'b'). The string \"abbabbcaabcab\" has 6 'b's, which is even. So, append 'ab' to the end.\n   - Result: \"abbabbcaabcabab\"\n\n3. **Operation 2**: Check if the string prefix is 'cb'. The string starts with 'ab', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n4. **Operation 3**: Check if the string contains 'bca'. The string \"abbabbcaabcabab\" contains 'bca'. Remove the first occurrence.\n   - Result: \"abbabcaabcabab\"\n\n5. **Operation 4**: Check if the string ends with 'ca'. The string ends with 'bab', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n6. **Operation 5**: Check if the string prefix is 'bc'. The string starts with 'ab', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n7. **Operation 6**: Check if the string contains 'abc'. The string \"abbabcaabcabab\" contains 'abc'. Replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - Result: \"abbabcabab\"\n\n8. **Repeat Operations**: Start again from Operation 1.\n\n9. **Operation 1**: The string \"abbabcabab\" has 5 'b's, which is odd. So, this operation is not applicable.\n\n10. **Operation 2**: The string starts with 'ab', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n11. **Operation 3**: The string \"abbabcabab\" contains 'bca'. Remove the first occurrence.\n    - Result: \"abbab\"\n\n12. **Operation 4**: The string ends with 'b', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n13. **Operation 5**: The string starts with 'ab', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n14. **Operation 6**: The string \"abbab\" does not contain 'abc', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n15. **Repeat Operations**: Start again from Operation 1.\n\n16. **Operation 1**: The string \"abbab\" has 3 'b's, which is odd. So, this operation is not applicable.\n\n17. **Operation 2**: The string starts with 'ab', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n18. **Operation 3**: The string \"abbab\" does not contain 'bca', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n19. **Operation 4**: The string ends with 'b', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n20. **Operation 5**: The string starts with 'ab', so this operation is not applicable.\n\n21. **Operation 6**: The string \"abbab\" does not contain 'abc', so this operation is not applicable.\n\nSince no operations can be applied anymore, the final string is \"abbab\".\n\n<<< \"abbab\" >>>"
