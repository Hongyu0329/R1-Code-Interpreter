    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"acbbcabcccbcc\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"acbbcabcccbcc\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: The string does not contain 'ca' after the first character, so this operation is not applicable.\n\n3. **Operation 2**: The string contains 'acb' starting at index 0.
