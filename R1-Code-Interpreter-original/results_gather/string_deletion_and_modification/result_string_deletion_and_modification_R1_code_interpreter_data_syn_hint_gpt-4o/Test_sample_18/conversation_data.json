    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations on the string \"bbbbbacacbccaaaab\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"bbbbbacacbccaaaab\"\n\n2. **Operation 3**: The string contains 'bca', so we remove the first occurrence entirely.\n   - New String: \"bbbbacacaaaab\"\n\n3. **Operation 5**: The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so we remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: \"bbbbacaaaab\"\n\n4. **Operation 6**: The string ends with 'aa', so we replace it with 'cc'.\n   - New String: \"bbbbacaaab\"\n\n5. **Operation 5**: The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so we remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: \"bbbbaaab\"\n\n6. **Operation 6**: The string ends with 'aa', so we replace it with 'cc'.\n   - New String: \"bbbbab\"\n\n7. **No further operations can be applied**: The string does not start with 'cc', does not start with 'aa', does not contain 'bca', does not end with 'bb', does not contain 'ca' after the first character, and does not end with 'aa'.\n\nThe final string after performing all operations is \"bbbbab\".\n\n<<< \"bbbbab\" >>>"
