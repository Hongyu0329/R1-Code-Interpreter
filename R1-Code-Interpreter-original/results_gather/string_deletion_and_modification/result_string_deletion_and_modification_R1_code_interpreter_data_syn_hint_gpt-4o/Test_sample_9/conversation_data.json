    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"bbcbccacaacbbab\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's go through the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"bbcbccacaacbbab\"\n\n2. **Operation 3**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - Result: \"bcbccacaacbbab\"\n\n3. **Operation 2**: If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - Result: \"bccacaacbbabaa\"\n\n4. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"bccacaacbbabaa\" (first 'ca' is at index 3)\n   - Result: \"bccacacbbabaa\"\n\n5. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"bccacbbabaa\"\n\n6. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"bccbbabaa\"\n\n7. **Operation 5**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n   - This operation does not apply as the suffix is not 'cc'.\n\n8. **Operation 6**: If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - This operation does not apply as the prefix is not 'cb'.\n\n9. **Operation 4**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - This operation does not apply as the prefix is not 'ca'.\n\n10. **Operation 3**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n    - This operation does not apply as the string does not start with 'bb'.\n\n11. **Operation 2**: If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n    - Result: \"cbbabaa\" + \"aa\"\n    - Result: \"cbbabaaaa\"\n\n12. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n    - This operation does not apply as there is no 'ca' in the string.\n\n13. **Operation 5**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n    - This operation does not apply as the suffix is not 'cc'.\n\n14. **Operation 6**: If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n    - Result: \"aababa\"\n\n15. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n    - This operation does not apply as there is no 'ca' in the string.\n\n16. **Operation 5**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n    - This operation does not apply as the suffix is not 'cc'.\n\n17. **Operation 6**: If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n    - This operation does not apply as the prefix is not 'cb'.\n\n18. **Operation 4**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n    - This operation does not apply as the prefix is not 'ca'.\n\n19. **Operation 3**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n    - This operation does not apply as the string does not start with 'bb'.\n\n20. **Operation 2**: If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n    - This operation does not apply as the prefix is not 'bc'.\n\n21. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n    - This operation does not apply as there is no 'ca' in the string.\n\nAt this point, no further operations can be applied.
