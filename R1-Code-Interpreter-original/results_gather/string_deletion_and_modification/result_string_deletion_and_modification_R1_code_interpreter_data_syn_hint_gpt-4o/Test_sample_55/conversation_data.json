    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"cbbaacbabccbcbba\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's go through the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cbbaacbabccbcbba\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 2**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n   - The string contains 'acb' at position 4-6. Replace 'acb' with 'bca'.\n   - New String: \"cbbabcbabccbcbba\"\n\n4. **Operation 3**: If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.\n   - The string does not end with 'bb', so no change.\n\n5. **Operation 4**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n   - The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n6. **Operation 5**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - The string contains 'abc' at position 4-6. Replace 'abc' with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcababccbcbba\"\n\n7. **Operation 6**: If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.\n   - The string ends with 'ba'. Replace 'ba' with 'ab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcababccbcbab\"\n\nNow, we repeat the operations from the beginning:\n\n1. **Operation 1**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\n2. **Operation 2**: The string does not contain 'acb', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 3**: The string does not end with 'bb', so no change.\n\n4. **Operation 4**: The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n5. **Operation 5**: The string contains 'abc' at position 5-7. Replace 'abc' with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcabcabccbcbab\"\n\n6. **Operation 6**: The string ends with 'ba'. Replace 'ba' with 'ab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcabcabccbcbab\"\n\nRepeat the operations again:\n\n1. **Operation 1**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\n2. **Operation 2**: The string does not contain 'acb', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 3**: The string does not end with 'bb', so no change.\n\n4. **Operation 4**: The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n5. **Operation 5**: The string contains 'abc' at position 5-7. Replace 'abc' with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcabccabccbcbab\"\n\n6. **Operation 6**: The string ends with 'ba'. Replace 'ba' with 'ab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcabccabccbcbab\"\n\nRepeat the operations again:\n\n1. **Operation 1**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\n2. **Operation 2**: The string does not contain 'acb', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 3**: The string does not end with 'bb', so no change.\n\n4. **Operation 4**: The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n5. **Operation 5**: The string contains 'abc' at position 5-7. Replace 'abc' with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcabccabccbcbab\"\n\n6. **Operation 6**: The string ends with 'ba'. Replace 'ba' with 'ab'.\n   - New String: \"cbbcabccabccbcbab\"\n\nAt this point, no further operations can be performed as the string does not meet any of the conditions for the operations. Therefore, the final string is:\n\n<<< \"cbbcabccabccbcbab\" >>>"
