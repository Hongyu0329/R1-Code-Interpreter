    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"bcbacacabbcaaacbcbc\" in a cycle until no further operations can be performed. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"bcbacacabbcaaacbcbc\"\n\n2. **Cycle through operations**:\n   - **Operation 3**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n     - Current string: \"bcbacacabbcaaacbcbc\" (no 'abc' present)\n   - **Operation 5**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n     - Current string: \"bcbacacabbcaaacbcbc\" (contains 'acb' at position 11)\n     - New string: \"bcbacabbbcaacbcbc\"\n   - **Operation 6**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n     - Current string: \"bcbacabbbcaacbcbc\" (contains 'ca' at position 4)\n     - New string: \"bcbabbbcaacbcbc\"\n   - **Operation 3**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n     - Current string: \"bcbabbbcaacbcbc\" (no 'abc' present)\n   - **Operation 5**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n     - Current string: \"bcbabbbcaacbcbc\" (contains 'acb' at position 8)\n     - New string: \"bcbabbbcbacbcbc\"\n   - **Operation 6**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n     - Current string: \"bcbabbbcbacbcbc\" (no 'ca' present after the first character)\n   - **Operation 3**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n     - Current string: \"bcbabbbcbacbcbc\" (no 'abc' present)\n   - **Operation 5**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n     - Current string: \"bcbabbbcbacbcbc\" (contains 'acb' at position 9)\n     - New string: \"bcbabbbcbcbacbc\"\n   - **Operation 6**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n     - Current string: \"bcbabbbcbcbacbc\" (no 'ca' present after the first character)\n\n3. **No further operations can be performed**: The string is now \"bcbabbbcbcbacbc\" and no more operations can be applied.\n\nThe final string after performing all operations is:\n\n<<< \"bcbabbbcbcbacbc\" >>>"
