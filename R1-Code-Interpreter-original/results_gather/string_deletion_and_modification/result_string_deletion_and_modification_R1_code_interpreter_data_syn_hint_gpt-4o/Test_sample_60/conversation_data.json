    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations on the string \"acabacaccbccaab\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's go through the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Check for 'bca':** The string \"acabacaccbccaab\" contains 'bca' starting at index 3. We remove the first occurrence, resulting in \"acaaccbccaab\".\n\n2. **Check for 'ca' (not at the start):** The string \"acaaccbccaab\" contains 'ca' starting at index 1. We remove the first occurrence after the first character, resulting in \"aacccbccaab\".\n\n3. **Check for 'aa' at the end:** The string \"aacccbccaab\" does not end with 'aa', so no change is made.\n\n4. **Check for 'ab' at the start:** The string \"aacccbccaab\" does not start with 'ab', so no change is made.\n\n5. **Check for 'ac' at the end:** The string \"aacccbccaab\" does not end with 'ac', so no change is made.\n\n6. **Check for 'cc' at the start:** The string \"aacccbccaab\" does not start with 'cc', so no change is made.\n\nNow, we repeat the cycle from the first operation:\n\n1. **Check for 'bca':** The string \"aacccbccaab\" does not contain 'bca', so no change is made.\n\n2. **Check for 'ca' (not at the start):** The string \"aacccbccaab\" contains 'ca' starting at index 6. We remove the first occurrence after the first character, resulting in \"aacccbcaab\".\n\n3. **Check for 'aa' at the end:** The string \"aacccbcaab\" does not end with 'aa', so no change is made.\n\n4. **Check for 'ab' at the start:** The string \"aacccbcaab\" does not start with 'ab', so no change is made.\n\n5. **Check for 'ac' at the end:** The string \"aacccbcaab\" does not end with 'ac', so no change is made.\n\n6. **Check for 'cc' at the start:** The string \"aacccbcaab\" does not start with 'cc', so no change is made.\n\nRepeat the cycle again:\n\n1. **Check for 'bca':** The string \"aacccbcaab\" contains 'bca' starting at index 5. We remove the first occurrence, resulting in \"aacccaab\".\n\n2. **Check for 'ca' (not at the start):** The string \"aacccaab\" contains 'ca' starting at index 3. We remove the first occurrence after the first character, resulting in \"aaccaab\".\n\n3. **Check for 'aa' at the end:** The string \"aaccaab\" ends with 'aa'. We replace it with 'cc', resulting in \"aaccbcc\".\n\n4. **Check for 'ab' at the start:** The string \"aaccbcc\" does not start with 'ab', so no change is made.\n\n5. **Check for 'ac' at the end:** The string \"aaccbcc\" does not end with 'ac', so no change is made.\n\n6. **Check for 'cc' at the start:** The string \"aaccbcc\" does not start with 'cc', so no change is made.\n\nRepeat the cycle again:\n\n1. **Check for 'bca':** The string \"aaccbcc\" does not contain 'bca', so no change is made.\n\n2. **Check for 'ca' (not at the start):** The string \"aaccbcc\" contains 'ca' starting at index 1. We remove the first occurrence after the first character, resulting in \"accbcc\".\n\n3. **Check for 'aa' at the end:** The string \"accbcc\" does not end with 'aa', so no change is made.\n\n4. **Check for 'ab' at the start:** The string \"accbcc\" does not start with 'ab', so no change is made.\n\n5. **Check for 'ac' at the end:** The string \"accbcc\" does not end with 'ac', so no change is made.\n\n6. **Check for 'cc' at the start:** The string \"accbcc\" does not start with 'cc', so no change is made.\n\nRepeat the cycle again:\n\n1. **Check for 'bca':** The string \"accbcc\" does not contain 'bca', so no change is made.\n\n2. **Check for 'ca' (not at the start):** The string \"accbcc\" does not contain 'ca' after the first character, so no change is made.\n\n3. **Check for 'aa' at the end:** The string \"accbcc\" does not end with 'aa', so no change is made.\n\n4. **Check for 'ab' at the start:** The string \"accbcc\" does not start with 'ab', so no change is made.\n\n5. **Check for 'ac' at the end:** The string \"accbcc\" does not end with 'ac', so no change is made.\n\n6. **Check for 'cc' at the start:** The string \"accbcc\" does not start with 'cc', so no change is made.\n\nNo further operations can be performed, so the final string is \"accbcc\".\n\n<<< \"accbcc\" >>>"
