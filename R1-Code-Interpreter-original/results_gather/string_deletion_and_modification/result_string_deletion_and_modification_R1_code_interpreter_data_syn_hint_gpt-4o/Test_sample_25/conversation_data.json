    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations on the string \"cbcccbcabcc\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's go through the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cbcccbcabcc\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with 'bca'.\n   - The string does not contain 'acb', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 2**: If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n   - The string does not start with 'ab', so no change.\n\n4. **Operation 3**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n   - The string ends with 'cc', so we replace 'cc' with 'b' and prepend 'a': \"acbcccbcab\"\n\n5. **Operation 4**: If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - The string contains 'ca' starting from the second character: \"acbcccbcab\" -> \"acbcccbab\"\n\n6. **Operation 5**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - The string does not contain 'abc', so no change.\n\n7. **Operation 6**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\nNow, we repeat the operations from the beginning:\n\n1. **Operation 1**: The string does not contain 'acb', so no change.\n\n2. **Operation 2**: The string does not start with 'ab', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 3**: The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n4. **Operation 4**: The string contains 'ca' starting from the second character: \"acbcccbab\" -> \"acbccbb\"\n\n5. **Operation 5**: The string does not contain 'abc', so no change.\n\n6. **Operation 6**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\nRepeat the operations again:\n\n1. **Operation 1**: The string does not contain 'acb', so no change.\n\n2. **Operation 2**: The string does not start with 'ab', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 3**: The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n4. **Operation 4**: The string contains 'ca' starting from the second character: \"acbccbb\" -> \"acbcbb\"\n\n5. **Operation 5**: The string does not contain 'abc', so no change.\n\n6. **Operation 6**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\nRepeat the operations again:\n\n1. **Operation 1**: The string does not contain 'acb', so no change.\n\n2. **Operation 2**: The string does not start with 'ab', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 3**: The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n4. **Operation 4**: The string contains 'ca' starting from the second character: \"acbcbb\" -> \"acbbb\"\n\n5. **Operation 5**: The string does not contain 'abc', so no change.\n\n6. **Operation 6**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\nRepeat the operations again:\n\n1. **Operation 1**: The string does not contain 'acb', so no change.\n\n2. **Operation 2**: The string does not start with 'ab', so no change.\n\n3. **Operation 3**: The string does not end with 'cc', so no change.\n\n4. **Operation 4**: The string does not contain 'ca' after the first character, so no change.\n\n5. **Operation 5**: The string does not contain 'abc', so no change.\n\n6. **Operation 6**: The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\nNo further operations can be performed. The final string is \"acbbb\".\n\n<<< \"acbbb\" >>>"
