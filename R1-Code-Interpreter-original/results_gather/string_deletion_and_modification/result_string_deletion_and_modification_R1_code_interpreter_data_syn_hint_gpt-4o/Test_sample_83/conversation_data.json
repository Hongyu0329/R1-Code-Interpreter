    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations on the string \"abbabbcaabcab\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's go through the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"abbabbcaabcab\"\n\n2. **Operation 1**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (6 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n   - New String: \"abbabbcaabcabab\"\n\n3. **Operation 2**: The string does not start with 'cb', so this operation is skipped.\n\n4. **Operation 3**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence.\n   - New String: \"abbabcaabcabab\"\n\n5. **Operation 4**: The string does not end with 'ca', so this operation is skipped.\n\n6. **Operation 5**: The string does not start with 'bc', so this operation is skipped.\n\n7. **Operation 6**: The string contains 'abc', so we replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"abbcabcaabab\"\n\n8. **Operation 1**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (6 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n   - New String: \"abbcabcaababab\"\n\n9. **Operation 2**: The string does not start with 'cb', so this operation is skipped.\n\n10. **Operation 3**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence.\n    - New String: \"abbcababab\"\n\n11. **Operation 4**: The string does not end with 'ca', so this operation is skipped.\n\n12. **Operation 5**: The string does not start with 'bc', so this operation is skipped.\n\n13. **Operation 6**: The string contains 'abc', so we replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n    - New String: \"abbcabab\"\n\n14. **Operation 1**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (6 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n    - New String: \"abbcababab\"\n\n15. **Operation 2**: The string does not start with 'cb', so this operation is skipped.\n\n16. **Operation 3**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence.\n    - New String: \"abbabab\"\n\n17. **Operation 4**: The string does not end with 'ca', so this operation is skipped.\n\n18. **Operation 5**: The string does not start with 'bc', so this operation is skipped.\n\n19. **Operation 6**: The string does not contain 'abc', so this operation is skipped.\n\n20. **Operation 1**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (4 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n    - New String: \"abbababab\"\n\n21. **Operation 2**: The string does not start with 'cb', so this operation is skipped.\n\n22. **Operation 3**: The string does not contain 'bca', so this operation is skipped.\n\n23. **Operation 4**: The string does not end with 'ca', so this operation is skipped.\n\n24. **Operation 5**: The string does not start with 'bc', so this operation is skipped.\n\n25. **Operation 6**: The string does not contain 'abc', so this operation is skipped.\n\nAt this point, no further operations can be performed.
