    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations to the string \"cbbcbcacccaabbcbcbca\" in the specified order until no further operations can be performed. Let's break down the operations and apply them step by step:\n\n1. **If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.**\n2. **If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.**\n3. **If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.**\n4. **If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.**\n5. **If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.**\n6. **If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.**\n\nLet's apply these operations step by step:\n\n1.
