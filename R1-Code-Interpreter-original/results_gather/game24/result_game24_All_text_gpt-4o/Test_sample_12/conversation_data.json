    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 3, 5, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 24.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Use Each Number Once**: We must use each of the numbers 1, 3, 5, and 12 exactly once.\n\n4. **Explore Combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\n5. **Check for Multiplication and Division**: Since 24 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be necessary to reach it. Division can also be used to adjust the result.\n\n6. **Try Different Groupings**: Parentheses can change the order of operations, so we should try different groupings.\n\nLet's try to find a combination:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value.\n- Try multiplying 5 and 3: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n- Now, consider how to use 1 and 12 to reach 24.\n- Add 12 to 15: \\(15 + 12 = 27\\).\n- Subtract 1 from 27: \\(27 - 1 = 26\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another:\n\n- Consider using 12 as a base since it's the largest number.\n- Try adding 12 and 5: \\(12 + 5 = 17\\).\n- Now, consider how to use 1 and 3 to reach 24.\n- Multiply 3 by 1: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\).\n- Add 3 to 17: \\(17 + 3 = 20\\).\n\nThis approach also doesn't work, so let's try another:\n\n- Consider using multiplication to reach a higher number.\n- Multiply 5 and 3: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n- Add 1 to 15: \\(15 + 1 = 16\\).\n- Now, consider how to use 12 to reach 24.\n- Add 12 to 16: \\(16 + 12 = 28\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another:\n\n- Consider using division to adjust the result.\n- Divide 12 by 3: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\).\n- Multiply 4 by 5: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n- Add 1 to 20: \\(20 + 1 = 21\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another:\n\n- Consider using subtraction to adjust the result.\n- Subtract 1 from 12: \\(12 - 1 = 11\\).\n- Multiply 11 by 3: \\(11 \\times 3 = 33\\).\n- Subtract 5 from 33: \\(33 - 5 = 28\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another:\n\n- Consider using a different combination of operations.\n- Multiply 5 and 3: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n- Add 12 to 15: \\(15 + 12 = 27\\).\n- Subtract 3 from 27: \\(27 - 3 = 24\\).\n\nThis approach works. Therefore, the correct combination is:\n\n\\[\n(5 \\times 3) + 12 - 3 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(5 * 3) + 12 - 3>>>"
