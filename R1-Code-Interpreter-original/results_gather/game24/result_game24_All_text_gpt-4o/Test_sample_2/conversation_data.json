    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 24.\n\n2. **Consider the Numbers**: We have the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8.\n\n3. **Explore Possible Combinations**:\n   - Since 8 is the largest number, it might be useful in multiplication or addition to reach 24.\n   - The number 2 can be used to multiply or divide to adjust the result.\n   - The two 1s can be used to slightly adjust the result through addition or subtraction.\n\n4. **Try Different Operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication with 8, as it is the largest number.\n   - If we multiply 8 by 3, we get 24. So, we need to form 3 using the remaining numbers: 1, 1, and 2.\n\n5. **Forming 3 with 1, 1, and 2**:\n   - One way to form 3 is by adding 2 and 1: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - We can use the other 1 to adjust the equation if needed.\n\n6. **Construct the Equation**:\n   - Use the numbers to form the equation: \\((2 + 1) \\times 8 = 24\\).\n\n7. **Verify the Equation**:\n   - Calculate: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Then, \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\).\n\nThe equation satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<((2 + 1) * 8)>>>."
