    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 8, 10, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 8, 10, 13.\n2. We need to use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to reach 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how it can be combined with others.\n- Try to form intermediate results that can be easily adjusted to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication to reach a higher number and then adjust with addition or subtraction:\n   - (13 - 10) = 3\n   - 3 * 8 = 24\n   - We have used 13, 10, and 8. Now, we need to incorporate 1.\n   - We can adjust the equation to include 1: (13 - (10 - 1)) * 8 = 24\n\n2. Verify the calculation:\n   - (10 - 1) = 9\n   - 13 - 9 = 4\n   - 4 * 8 = 32, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Consider using addition and subtraction to form 24:\n   - 13 + 10 = 23\n   - 23 + 1 = 24\n   - We have used 13, 10, and 1. Now, we need to incorporate 8.\n   - Adjust the equation to include 8: (13 + 10 + 1) - 8 = 24\n\n2. Verify the calculation:\n   - 13 + 10 = 23\n   - 23 + 1 = 24\n   - 24 - 8 = 16, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Consider using division to simplify the numbers:\n   - 13 - 1 = 12\n   - 12 + 10 = 22\n   - 22 + 8 = 30, which is incorrect.\n\nFinally, let's try another approach:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication and division:\n   - (13 - 1) = 12\n   - 12 * 2 = 24\n   - We have used 13, 1, and 2. Now, we need to incorporate 8.\n   - Adjust the equation to include 8: (13 - 1) * (10 / 8) = 24\n\n2. Verify the calculation:\n   - 13 - 1 = 12\n   - 10 / 8 = 1.25\n   - 12 * 1.25 = 15, which is incorrect.\n\nAfter several attempts, let's try a different approach:\n\n1. Consider using subtraction and addition:\n   - 13 + 10 = 23\n   - 23 + 1 = 24\n   - We have used 13, 10, and 1. Now, we need to incorporate 8.\n   - Adjust the equation to include 8: (13 + 10 + 1) - 8 = 24\n\n2.
