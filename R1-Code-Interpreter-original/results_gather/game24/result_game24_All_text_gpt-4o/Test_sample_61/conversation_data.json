    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 3, 13, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 1, 3, 13, and 13.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- **Step 1**: Consider using multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- **Step 2**: Try using the larger numbers first, as they have a greater impact on reaching 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Use the two 13s: \\(13 + 13 = 26\\)\n- Subtract 3: \\(26 - 3 = 23\\)\n- Add 1: \\(23 + 1 = 24\\)\n\nThis combination uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((13 + 13) - 3 + 1)>>>"
