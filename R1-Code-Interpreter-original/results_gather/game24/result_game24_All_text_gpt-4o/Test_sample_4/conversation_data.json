    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 11, we need to carefully consider how to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 1, 1, 2, and 11.\n\n2. **Consider the target**: We need to reach the number 24.\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Since 11 is the largest number, it might be useful to either multiply or add to reach 24.\n   - We can try to use multiplication to get closer to 24, as addition with these numbers might not be sufficient.\n\n4. **Try different operations**:\n   - If we multiply 11 by 2, we get 22, which is close to 24.\n   - We need to add 2 more to reach 24.\n\n5. **Use the remaining numbers**:\n   - We have two 1s left. We can add them together to get 2.\n\n6. **Combine the results**:\n   - Add the result of 11 * 2 (which is 22) to the sum of the two 1s (which is 2).\n\n7. **Verify the solution**:\n   - (11 * 2) + (1 + 1) = 22 + 2 = 24.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(11 * 2) + (1 + 1)>>>"
