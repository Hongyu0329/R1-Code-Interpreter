    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 5, 11, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. **Identify potential operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers with the operations to reach 24.\n\n3. **Start with multiplication and division**: These operations can quickly increase or decrease the value, which might help in reaching 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings**: Use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps in reaching the target.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: Start with multiplication and addition.\n  - Try multiplying two numbers and then adding the others.\n  - Example: (4 * 5) + 11 - 12 = 20 + 11 - 12 = 19 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 2**: Use division to simplify.\n  - Example: (12 / 4) * 5 + 11 = 3 * 5 + 11 = 15 + 11 = 26 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 3**: Use subtraction and addition.\n  - Example: 12 - (11 - (5 + 4)) = 12 - (11 - 9) = 12 - 2 = 10 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 4**: Try different groupings and operations.\n  - Example: (11 + 5) + (12 - 4) = 16 + 8 = 24\n\nThis combination works. Let's verify:\n\n- (11 + 5) = 16\n- (12 - 4) = 8\n- 16 + 8 = 24\n\nThus, the correct equation using the numbers 4, 5, 11, and 12 to obtain 24 is:\n\n<<<(11 + 5) + (12 - 4)>>>"
