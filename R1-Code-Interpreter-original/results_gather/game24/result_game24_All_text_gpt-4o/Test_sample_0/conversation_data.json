    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 4, and 6 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 1s, which can be used to either add, subtract, multiply, or divide without changing the value significantly.\n2. The number 4 can be used to multiply or add to reach closer to 24.\n3. The number 6 is relatively large and can be used effectively in multiplication or addition.\n\nLet's try to form the number 24 step by step:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value:\n  - 6 * 4 = 24. This directly gives us 24, but we haven't used the two 1s yet.\n\n- We need to incorporate the two 1s:\n  - We can use the two 1s in a way that doesn't change the result of 24:\n    - (6 * 4) + (1 - 1) = 24 + 0 = 24\n\nThus, the expression that uses all numbers exactly once and results in 24 is:\n\n<<<(6 * 4) + (1 - 1)>>>"
