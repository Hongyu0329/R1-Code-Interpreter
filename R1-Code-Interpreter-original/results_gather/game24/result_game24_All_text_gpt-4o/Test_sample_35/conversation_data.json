    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 6, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 2, 6, 12.\n2. We need to use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to reach 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n- Consider using 12, as it is the largest number and can be a good candidate for multiplication.\n- Try multiplying 12 by 2 to get 24: 12 * 2 = 24. However, this uses only two numbers.\n- We need to incorporate 1 and 6 into the equation.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using division to simplify the numbers.\n- Try dividing 12 by 6: 12 / 6 = 2.\n- Now we have 1, 2, and 2.\n- Multiply 2 by 6: 2 * 6 = 12.\n- Add 12 to 12: 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nThis approach uses all numbers and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(12 / 6) * (1 + 2) = 24>>>"
