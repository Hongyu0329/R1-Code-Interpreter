    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 11, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 5, 5, 11, and 12.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one results in 24.\n\n4. **Trial and error**:\n   - Start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how it can be combined with others.\n   - Try using multiplication and addition first, as they can quickly increase the value.\n\n5. **Calculate step by step**:\n   - Consider using multiplication to increase the value quickly: 5 * 5 = 25.\n   - Then, subtract 11 to get closer to 24: 25 - 11 = 14.\n   - Finally, add 12 to reach 24: 14 + 12 = 26, which is incorrect.\n\n6. **Re-evaluate and try another approach**:\n   - Try using addition and subtraction differently.\n   - Consider: (5 + 5) = 10.\n   - Then, add 11: 10 + 11 = 21.\n   - Finally, add 12: 21 + 12 = 33, which is incorrect.\n\n7. **Try another combination**:\n   - Consider: 12 - 11 = 1.\n   - Then, multiply by 5: 1 * 5 = 5.\n   - Finally, add the remaining 5: 5 + 5 = 10, which is incorrect.\n\n8. **Re-evaluate and try another approach**:\n   - Consider: 5 + 5 = 10.\n   - Then, multiply by 11: 10 * 11 = 110.\n   - Finally, divide by 12: 110 / 12 = 9.1667, which is incorrect.\n\n9. **Try another combination**:\n   - Consider: 5 * 5 = 25.\n   - Then, subtract 12: 25 - 12 = 13.\n   - Finally, subtract 11: 13 - 11 = 2, which is incorrect.\n\n10. **Re-evaluate and try another approach**:\n    - Consider: 5 + 11 = 16.\n    - Then, add 12: 16 + 12 = 28.\n    - Finally, subtract 5: 28 - 5 = 23, which is incorrect.\n\n11. **Try another combination**:\n    - Consider: 5 * 5 = 25.\n    - Then, subtract 11: 25 - 11 = 14.\n    - Finally, add 12: 14 + 12 = 26, which is incorrect.\n\n12. **Re-evaluate and try another approach**:\n    - Consider: 5 + 12 = 17.\n    - Then, add 11: 17 + 11 = 28.\n    - Finally, subtract 5: 28 - 5 = 23, which is incorrect.\n\n13. **Try another combination**:\n    - Consider: 5 * 5 = 25.\n    - Then, subtract 12: 25 - 12 = 13.\n    - Finally, add 11: 13 + 11 = 24, which is correct.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, the correct solution is found:\n\n<<<(5 * 5) - 12 + 11 = 24>>>"
