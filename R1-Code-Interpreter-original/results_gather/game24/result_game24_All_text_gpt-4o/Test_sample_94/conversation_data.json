    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 8 exactly once each, along with basic arithmetic operations, to obtain the result of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Identify potential operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\n3. **Start with multiplication and division**: These operations can quickly increase or decrease the value, which might help in reaching 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings**: Use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps in reaching the target.\n\n5. **Check for simple solutions**: Sometimes, a straightforward combination of operations can yield the result.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: Try using multiplication and addition.\n  - (3 * 7) + (8 - 1) = 21 + 7 = 28 (too high)\n\n- **Combination 2**: Try using division and addition.\n  - (8 / 1) + (3 * 7) = 8 + 21 = 29 (too high)\n\n- **Combination 3**: Try using subtraction and multiplication.\n  - (8 - 3) * (7 - 1) = 5 * 6 = 30 (too high)\n\n- **Combination 4**: Try using addition and division.\n  - (7 + 1) * (3 - 1) = 8 * 2 = 16 (too low)\n\n- **Combination 5**: Try using a mix of operations.\n  - (7 - 1) * (3 + 1) = 6 * 4 = 24 (correct)\n\nAfter testing various combinations, we find that the correct combination is:\n\n- **Final Solution**: (7 - 1) * (3 + 1) = 6 * 4 = 24\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<(7 - 1) * (3 + 1)>>>"
