    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 6, 6, and 12 to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 6, 6, and 12.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - We can start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n   - Since 24 is double 12, we can consider multiplying 12 by 2. However, we don't have a direct 2, but we can create it using the other numbers.\n\n4. **Create 2 using the numbers**:\n   - We have two 6s, which can be used to create 1 by dividing: \\(6 / 6 = 1\\).\n   - We can then add this 1 to 1 (from the number 3 minus 2) to get 2: \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\n\n5. **Combine to reach 24**:\n   - Now, multiply 12 by 2 to get 24: \\(12 * 2 = 24\\).\n\n6. **Verify the use of all numbers**:\n   - We used 3 to create 2.\n   - We used both 6s to create 1.\n   - We used 12 in the final multiplication.\n\nThus, the equation that uses all numbers exactly once to reach 24 is:\n\n\\[\n(12 * ((3 - (6 / 6))))\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(12 * ((3 - (6 / 6))))>>>"
