    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 4, 5, and 5 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have the numbers 4, 4, 5, and 5.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings and operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Consider the pair (5 * 5) = 25, which is close to 24.\n   - We need to adjust this result by 1 to reach 24.\n\n5. **Use the remaining numbers**:\n   - We have two 4s left. We can use subtraction to adjust the result.\n   - Consider (5 * 5) - (4 / 4) = 25 - 1 = 24.\n\n6. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Calculate (5 * 5) = 25.\n   - Calculate (4 / 4) = 1.\n   - Subtract the results: 25 - 1 = 24.\n\nThe operations and grouping are correct, and all numbers are used exactly once.\n\nFinal answer: <<<((5 * 5) - (4 / 4))>>>."
