    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the target**: We need to reach the number 24.\n\n2. **Consider the numbers**: We have three 2s and one 12.\n\n3. **Explore operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n4. **Start with the largest number**: The number 12 is the largest, and we need to reach 24. One way to think about this is to double 12, which gives us 24. This suggests that multiplication might be useful.\n\n5. **Use the remaining numbers**: We have three 2s left. We need to use them in a way that results in multiplying 12 by 2.\n\n6. **Formulate a plan**: \n   - If we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24. \n   - We can achieve this by using the remaining two 2s to form the number 2 through division: (2/2) = 1.\n   - Then, add 1 to the remaining 2 to get 2: (2 + (2/2)) = 2.\n   - Finally, multiply this result by 12: 12 * 2 = 24.\n\n7. **Verify the solution**: \n   - Use the numbers: 2, 2, 2, 12.\n   - Operations: (2 + (2/2)) = 2, then 12 * 2 = 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<12 * (2 + (2/2))>>>."
