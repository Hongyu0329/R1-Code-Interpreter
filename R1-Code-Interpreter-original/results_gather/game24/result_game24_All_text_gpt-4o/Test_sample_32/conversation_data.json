    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 11, and 11 to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 11s, which can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided.\n2. We have a 2, which can be used to multiply or divide to adjust the result.\n3. We have a 1, which can be used to adjust the result slightly by addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that results in 24:\n\n- Start by considering the two 11s. Adding them gives us 22, which is close to 24.\n- We can add 2 to 22 to get 24. So, one possible operation is 11 + 11 + 2 = 24.\n- The number 1 can be used in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as multiplying by 1.\n\nThus, the equation that uses all numbers and results in 24 is:\n\n(11 + 11 + 2) * 1 = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(11 + 11 + 2) * 1>>>"
