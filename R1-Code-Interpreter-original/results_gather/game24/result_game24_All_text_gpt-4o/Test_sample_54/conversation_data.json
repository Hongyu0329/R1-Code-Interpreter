    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 9 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 7, 9, and 9.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: We must ensure that each number is used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\nNow, let's try to find a combination of operations that will yield 24:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Notice that 9 + 9 = 18, which is close to 24. We can use this as a base.\n- We have 3 and 7 left. Consider using multiplication to adjust the value.\n- If we multiply 3 by 2, we get 6, which can be added to 18 to reach 24.\n\nLet's construct the equation:\n\n- Use the two 9s: 9 + 9 = 18\n- Use the 3 and 7: 3 * 2 = 6 (where 2 is derived from 7 - 5)\n- Add the results: 18 + 6 = 24\n\nThus, the equation is: (9 + 9) + (3 * (7 - 5)) = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(9 + 9) + (3 * (7 - 5))>>>"
