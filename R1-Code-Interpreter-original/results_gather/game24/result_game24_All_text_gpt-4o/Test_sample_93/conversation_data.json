    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 2, 6, 7, and 9, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations and combinations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 2, 6, 7, and 9.\n\n2. **Consider basic operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Start by considering pairs of numbers and operations that can be combined to get closer to 24.\n   - Try different operations and see if they can be combined to reach 24.\n\n4. **Trial and error**:\n   - Check if any two numbers can be combined to form a number that can be easily manipulated with the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n   - Consider using multiplication and division first, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n\n5. **Step-by-step calculation**:\n   - Let's try combining 6 and 7 first: 6 * 7 = 42.\n   - Now, consider how to use 2 and 9 with 42 to reach 24.\n   - Try subtracting 9 from 42: 42 - 9 = 33.\n   - Now, use 2 to adjust 33 to 24: 33 / 2 = 16.5 (not an integer, so this doesn't work).\n\n6. **Re-evaluate and try another approach**:\n   - Try using 9 and 2 first: 9 - 2 = 7.\n   - Now, use 6 and 7: 6 * 7 = 42.\n   - Subtract 42 from 7: 42 - 7 = 35 (not useful).\n\n7. **Try a different combination**:\n   - Use 9 and 6: 9 + 6 = 15.\n   - Now, use 7 and 2: 7 * 2 = 14.\n   - Add 15 and 14: 15 + 14 = 29 (not useful).\n\n8. **Try another approach**:\n   - Use 9 and 7: 9 - 7 = 2.\n   - Now, use 6 and 2: 6 * 2 = 12.\n   - Add 12 and 12: 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we find that the correct combination is:\n\n- Use 9 and 7: 9 - 7 = 2.\n- Use 6 and 2: 6 * 2 = 12.\n- Add 12 and 12: 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(9 - 7) + (6 * 2)>>>"
