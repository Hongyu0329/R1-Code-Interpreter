    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 8, 11, and 11 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 11s, which can be useful for addition or subtraction.\n2. The number 8 is relatively large, so it might be useful in addition or multiplication.\n3. The number 6 is smaller, which might be useful in multiplication or division.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- Start by considering addition and multiplication, as they can quickly increase the value:\n  - If we add the two 11s: 11 + 11 = 22\n  - We need 2 more to reach 24. We can achieve this by adding 2, which can be obtained by subtracting 6 from 8: 8 - 6 = 2\n  - Therefore, the expression becomes: (11 + 11) + (8 - 6) = 24\n\nThis combination uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nFinal answer: <<<((11 + 11) + (8 - 6))>>>."
