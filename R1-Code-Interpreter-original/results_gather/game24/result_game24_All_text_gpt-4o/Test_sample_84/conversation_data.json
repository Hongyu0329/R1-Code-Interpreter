    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 2, 9, 9, and 13.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one results in 24.\n\n4. **Trial and error**:\n   - Start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how it can be combined with others.\n   - Try using multiplication and addition first, as they can quickly increase the value.\n\n5. **Test combinations**:\n   - Consider using multiplication to increase the value quickly, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - For example, try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n\n6. **Check calculations**:\n   - Ensure each calculation uses all numbers exactly once.\n   - Verify the result is exactly 24.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 as follows:\n  - First, add 9 and 13: \\(9 + 13 = 22\\).\n  - Then, add the other 9: \\(22 + 9 = 31\\).\n  - Finally, subtract 2: \\(31 - 2 = 29\\).\n\nHowever, this does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 as follows:\n  - First, add 9 and 13: \\(9 + 13 = 22\\).\n  - Then, subtract 9: \\(22 - 9 = 13\\).\n  - Finally, add 2: \\(13 + 2 = 15\\).\n\nThis still does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 as follows:\n  - First, multiply 9 and 2: \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\).\n  - Then, add 9: \\(18 + 9 = 27\\).\n  - Finally, subtract 13: \\(27 - 13 = 14\\).\n\nThis still does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 as follows:\n  - First, multiply 9 and 2: \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\).\n  - Then, add 13: \\(18 + 13 = 31\\).\n  - Finally, subtract 9: \\(31 - 9 = 22\\).\n\nThis still does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 as follows:\n  - First, add 9 and 13: \\(9 + 13 = 22\\).\n  - Then, add 2: \\(22 + 2 = 24\\).\n  - Finally, subtract 9: \\(24 - 9 = 15\\).\n\nThis still does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 as follows:\n  - First, add 9 and 13: \\(9 + 13 = 22\\).\n  - Then, add 2: \\(22 + 2 = 24\\).\n\nThis yields 24, but we have not used all numbers.
