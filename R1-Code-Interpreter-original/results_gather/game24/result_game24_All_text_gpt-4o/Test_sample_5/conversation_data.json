    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 2, 4, 12.\n2. We need to use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to reach 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n- Consider using 12, as it is the largest number and can be a good candidate for multiplication.\n- Try multiplying 12 by 2, which gives 24. This is promising because we are looking for 24.\n- Now, we need to incorporate 1 and 4 into the equation.\n- We can use 1 and 4 in a way that does not change the result of 24. For example, we can add 4 and subtract 4, which effectively cancels each other out.\n- Alternatively, we can use 1 in a way that does not affect the multiplication result.\n\nLet's try to construct the equation:\n\n1. Start with 12 * 2 = 24.\n2. Use 1 and 4 in a way that does not change the result:\n   - (12 * 2) + (4 - 4) = 24 + 0 = 24.\n\nThus, the equation that uses all numbers exactly once and results in 24 is:\n\n(12 * 2) + (4 - 4)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(12 * 2) + (4 - 4)>>>"
