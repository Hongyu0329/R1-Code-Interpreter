    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 7, 10, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations step by step:\n\n1. **Identify possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers with the operations to reach 24.\n\n3. **Start with multiplication and division**: These operations can quickly increase or decrease the value, which might help in reaching 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings**: Use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps in reaching the target.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: Start with multiplication and addition.\n  - (5 * 7) = 35\n  - 35 - 10 = 25\n  - 25 - 12 = 13 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 2**: Try using division.\n  - 10 / 5 = 2\n  - 2 * 12 = 24\n  - 24 - 7 = 17 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 3**: Try another approach.\n  - 12 - 10 = 2\n  - 2 * 5 = 10\n  - 10 + 7 = 17 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 4**: Try using addition and multiplication.\n  - 5 + 7 = 12\n  - 12 * 2 = 24 (using 10 as 2)\n  - This does not use all numbers correctly.\n\n- **Combination 5**: Try a different grouping.\n  - 12 - 5 = 7\n  - 7 * 2 = 14\n  - 14 + 10 = 24 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 6**: Try using subtraction and multiplication.\n  - 12 - 7 = 5\n  - 5 * 5 = 25\n  - 25 - 10 = 15 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 7**: Try using division and addition.\n  - 10 - 5 = 5\n  - 5 * 2 = 10\n  - 10 + 12 = 22 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 8**: Try using a different approach.\n  - 12 / 6 = 2 (using 10 as 6)\n  - 2 * 5 = 10\n  - 10 + 7 = 17 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 9**: Try using subtraction and addition.\n  - 12 - 10 = 2\n  - 2 * 5 = 10\n  - 10 + 7 = 17 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 10**: Try using a different approach.\n  - 5 + 12 = 17\n  - 17 - 10 = 7\n  - 7 * 2 = 14 (does not work)\n\n- **Combination 11**: Try using a different approach.\n  -
