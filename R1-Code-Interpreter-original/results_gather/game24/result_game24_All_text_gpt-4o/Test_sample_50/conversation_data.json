    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 12, 12, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 2, 12, 12, and 12.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try different approaches:\n\n- **Approach 1**: Start with multiplication and addition.\n  - Multiply two of the 12s: \\(12 \\times 12 = 144\\).\n  - This result is too large, so let's try another approach.\n\n- **Approach 2**: Use division to simplify.\n  - Divide one 12 by the other: \\(12 / 12 = 1\\).\n  - Now we have 2, 1, and 12 left.\n  - Multiply 2 by 12: \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n  - Add the result of the division: \\(24 + 1 = 25\\).\n  - This is not correct, so let's try another approach.\n\n- **Approach 3**: Use subtraction and multiplication.\n  - Subtract one 12 from another: \\(12 - 12 = 0\\).\n  - Now we have 2, 0, and 12 left.\n  - Multiply 2 by 12: \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n  - Add the result of the subtraction: \\(24 + 0 = 24\\).\n  - This approach works.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is:\n\\[\n(2 \\times 12) + (12 - 12) = 24\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<(2 * 12) + (12 - 12)>>>"
