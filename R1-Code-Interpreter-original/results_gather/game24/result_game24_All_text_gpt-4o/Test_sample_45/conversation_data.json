    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 7 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 1s, which can be used to either add, subtract, multiply, or divide without changing the value significantly.\n2. The number 5 can be used to increase or decrease the total significantly when added or subtracted.\n3. The number 7 is the largest and can be used to reach closer to 24 when multiplied or added.\n\nNow, let's try to combine these numbers step by step:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value:\n  - Multiply 5 and 7: \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\)\n- We need to adjust this result to reach 24. We have two 1s left:\n  - Subtract 1 from 35: \\(35 - 1 = 34\\)\n  - Subtract the other 1 from 34: \\(34 - 1 = 33\\)\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Consider using addition and subtraction:\n  - Add 5 and 7: \\(5 + 7 = 12\\)\n  - Multiply 12 by 2 (using the two 1s as a multiplication factor): \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\)\n\nThis approach also doesn't work directly, so let's try another method:\n\n- Use the two 1s to form a multiplication factor:\n  - Multiply 1 and 1: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n- Add 5 and 7: \\(5 + 7 = 12\\)\n- Multiply 12 by 2 (using the result of 1 + 1): \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\)\n\nThis approach works. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((5 + 7) * (1 + 1))>>>"
