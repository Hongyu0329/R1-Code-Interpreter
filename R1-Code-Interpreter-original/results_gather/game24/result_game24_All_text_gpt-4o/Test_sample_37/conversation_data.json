    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 8, and 9 exactly once each, along with basic arithmetic operations, to obtain the result of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Identify potential operations and combinations:**\n   - We have the numbers 1, 6, 8, and 9.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider possible pairings and operations:**\n   - Start by considering simple operations like addition and multiplication, as they can quickly increase the value.\n   - Consider using subtraction and division to adjust the total to exactly 24.\n\n3. **Try different combinations:**\n   - One approach is to try multiplying two numbers and then adjust with the others.\n   - Another approach is to try adding or subtracting numbers to get close to 24, then adjust with multiplication or division.\n\n4. **Test combinations:**\n   - Let's try multiplying 6 and 8: \\(6 \\times 8 = 48\\).\n   - We need to adjust 48 to 24. Consider using division or subtraction.\n   - If we divide 48 by 2, we get 24. We can achieve this by using the numbers 1 and 9.\n   - Consider the expression: \\((6 \\times 8) / (9 - 1)\\).\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Calculate \\((6 \\times 8) = 48\\).\n   - Calculate \\(9 - 1 = 8\\).\n   - Divide 48 by 8: \\(48 / 8 = 6\\).\n   - This does not give us 24, so let's try another approach.\n\n6. **Re-evaluate and try a different approach:**\n   - Consider using addition and subtraction to adjust the total.\n   - Try: \\((9 + 8) = 17\\).\n   - Add 1 to 17: \\(17 + 1 = 18\\).\n   - Multiply by 6: \\(18 \\times 6 = 108\\).\n   - This is incorrect, so let's try another approach.\n\n7. **Try another combination:**\n   - Consider: \\((9 - 1) = 8\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n   - We can achieve this by using the numbers 6 and 8.\n   - Consider the expression: \\((9 - 1) \\times (6 - 4)\\).\n\n8. **Verify the final solution:**\n   - Calculate \\(9 - 1 = 8\\).\n   - Calculate \\(6 - 4 = 2\\).\n   - Multiply 8 by 2: \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\).\n   - This is incorrect, so let's try another approach.\n\n9. **Final attempt:**\n   - Consider: \\((8 \\times 3) = 24\\).\n   - We can achieve this by using the numbers 6 and 9.\n   - Consider the expression: \\((6 \\times 4) - (9 - 1)\\).\n\n10. **Verify the final solution:**\n    - Calculate \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n    - Calculate \\(9 - 1 = 8\\).\n    - Subtract 8 from 24: \\(24 - 8 = 16\\).\n    - This is incorrect, so let's try another approach.\n\n11. **Re-evaluate and try a different approach:**\n    - Consider: \\((9 - 1) = 8\\).\n    - Multiply by 3: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n    - We can achieve this by using the numbers 6 and 8.\n    - Consider the expression: \\((9 - 1) \\times (6 - 4)\\).\n\n12. **Verify the final solution:**\n    -
