    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 10, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations step by step:\n\n1. **Identify potential operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\n3. **Start with multiplication and addition**: These operations often help in reaching larger numbers like 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings**: Use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps in reaching the target number.\n\n5. **Check each step**: Ensure that each number is used exactly once and that the operations are valid (e.g., no division by zero).\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach 24.\n- Try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 5 to get 25.\n- Subtract 1 to get 24.\n\nHowever, this doesn't use all numbers. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 12 and 2 to get 24.\n- Add 1 and subtract 5.\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 12 and 1 to get 12.\n- Add 10 to get 22.\n- Add 2 to get 24.\n\nThis uses all numbers and operations correctly.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<(12 + 10 + 2)>>>"
