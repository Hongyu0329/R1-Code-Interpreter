    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 6, 6, and 8 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 2, 6, 6, and 8.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations and numbers to see which one results in 24.\n\n4. **Trial and error**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers.\n   - Consider using division to simplify or adjust the result.\n\n5. **Attempt a solution**:\n   - Let's try combining the numbers in different ways:\n     - One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition:\n       - Calculate \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\). We need to form 4 using the remaining numbers.\n       - Notice that \\(8 - 6 = 2\\).\n       - Therefore, \\(6 \\times (8 - 6) = 6 \\times 2 = 12\\), which is not 24.\n     - Try another approach:\n       - Calculate \\(6 + 6 = 12\\).\n       - Then, \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n       - We have used 2, 6, and 6, but not 8.\n     - Try another approach:\n       - Calculate \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n       - Form 4 using the remaining numbers: \\(8 - 6 = 2\\).\n       - Then, \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n       - Therefore, \\(6 \\times (8 - 6) = 6 \\times 2 = 12\\), which is not 24.\n     - Try another approach:\n       -
