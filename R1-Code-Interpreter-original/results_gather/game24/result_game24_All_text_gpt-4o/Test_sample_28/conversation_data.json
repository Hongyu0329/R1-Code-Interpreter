    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 8 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 4, 6, 8, and 8.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: \n  - Start with multiplication: 8 * 3 = 24. \n  - We need to form 3 using the remaining numbers: 4, 6, and 8.\n  - Notice that (6 - 4) = 2, and we have another 8.\n  - So, (6 - 4) + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10, which doesn't work.\n\n- **Combination 2**:\n  - Try using division: 8 / 4 = 2.\n  - We need to form 12 using the remaining numbers: 6 and 8.\n  - Notice that 6 + 8 = 14, which is too large.\n\n- **Combination 3**:\n  - Try using subtraction: 8 - 4 = 4.\n  - We need to form 6 using the remaining numbers: 6 and 8.\n  - Notice that 6 is already available, and 8 - 8 = 0, which doesn't help.\n\n- **Combination 4**:\n  - Try using addition: 8 + 8 = 16.\n  - We need to form 8 using the remaining numbers: 4 and 6.\n  - Notice that 6 + 4 = 10, which is too large.\n\n- **Combination 5**:\n  - Try using multiplication: 8 * 3 = 24.\n  - We need to form 3 using the remaining numbers: 4, 6, and 8.\n  - Notice that (8 / 4) = 2, and we have 6.\n  - So, (8 / 4) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8, which doesn't work.\n\n- **Combination 6**:\n  - Try using multiplication and addition: (6 * 4) = 24.\n  - We need to use the remaining numbers: 8 and 8.\n  - Notice that 8 - 8 = 0, which doesn't help.\n\n- **Combination 7**:\n  - Try using addition and division: (8 + 8) = 16.\n  - We need to form 8 using the remaining numbers: 4 and 6.\n  - Notice that (6 - 4) = 2, and 16 / 2 = 8, which doesn't work.\n\n- **Combination 8**:\n  - Try using subtraction and multiplication: (8 - 4) = 4.\n  - We need to form 6 using the remaining numbers: 6 and 8.\n  - Notice that 6 is already available, and 8 - 8 = 0, which doesn't help.\n\n- **Combination 9**:\n  - Try using addition and multiplication: (4 + 8) = 12.\n  - We need to form 2 using the remaining numbers: 6 and 8.\n  - Notice that (8 - 6) = 2, and 12 * 2 = 24.\n\nThis combination works. Therefore, the correct equation is:\n\n(4 + 8) * (8 - 6) = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(4 + 8) * (8 - 6)>>>"
