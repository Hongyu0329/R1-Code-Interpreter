    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 4, 11, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 4, 4, 11, and 13.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Start by considering combinations that involve multiplication or division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Consider using addition or subtraction to adjust the result to 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings and operations**:\n   - We can try multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the others.\n   - We can also try adding or subtracting numbers first and then multiplying or dividing.\n\n5. **Test potential solutions**:\n   - One potential approach is to use multiplication to reach a number close to 24 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - Another approach is to use addition or subtraction to reach a number that can be easily adjusted to 24 with multiplication or division.\n\n6. **Calculate and verify**:\n   - Let's try the following combination: (4 * 4) + (13 - 11)\n   - Calculate: 4 * 4 = 16\n   - Calculate: 13 - 11 = 2\n   - Add the results: 16 + 2 = 18 (This does not work)\n\n7. **Try another combination**:\n   - Let's try: (13 - 11) * 4 + 4\n   - Calculate: 13 - 11 = 2\n   - Calculate: 2 * 4 = 8\n   - Add the remaining 4: 8 + 4 = 12 (This does not work)\n\n8. **Try another combination**:\n   - Let's try: (13 - (11 - 4)) * 4\n   - Calculate: 11 - 4 = 7\n   - Calculate: 13 - 7 = 6\n   - Calculate: 6 * 4 = 24 (This works)\n\nAfter testing various combinations, we find that the correct solution is:\n\n<<<(13 - (11 - 4)) * 4>>>"
