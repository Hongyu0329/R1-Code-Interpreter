    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 4, 10, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. **Identify potential operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\n3. **Start with multiplication and division**: These operations can quickly increase or decrease the value, which might help in reaching 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings**: Use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps in reaching the target.\n\nLet's try a step-by-step approach:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach a higher number like 24.\n- Consider the largest number, 12, and see how it can be used effectively.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1. **Try using multiplication first**: \n   - Multiply 4 and 6: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\). However, we don't have 6 in our numbers, so this doesn't work.\n\n2. **Try using addition and multiplication**:\n   - Add 10 and 2: \\(10 + 2 = 12\\).\n   - Multiply the result by 2: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Check if all numbers are used**:\n   - We used 10, 2, and 12. We need to incorporate 4 as well.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate the approach**:\n   - Consider using subtraction or division to adjust the result.\n\n5. **Try a different combination**:\n   - Add 10 and 12: \\(10 + 12 = 22\\).\n   - Add 2: \\(22 + 2 = 24\\).\n   - We still need to use 4.\n\n6. **Re-evaluate and try another approach**:\n   - Consider using division to adjust the result.\n\n7. **Final approach**:\n   - Add 10 and 12: \\(10 + 12 = 22\\).\n   - Add 4: \\(22 + 4 = 26\\).\n   - Subtract 2: \\(26 - 2 = 24\\).\n\nThis approach uses all numbers and results in 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<((10 + 12) + 4 - 2)>>>."
