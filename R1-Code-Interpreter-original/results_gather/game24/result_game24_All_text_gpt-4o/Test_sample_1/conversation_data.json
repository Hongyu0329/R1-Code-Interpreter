    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 1s, which are small numbers, and a 2, which is also small. The number 12 is relatively large compared to the others.\n2. To reach 24, we might consider using multiplication with the larger number, 12, since multiplying by 2 could help us reach 24.\n3. We can try to form an equation that uses multiplication and addition or subtraction to reach 24.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 12, and how it can be used to reach 24.\n- If we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24. However, we need to use all numbers, including the two 1s.\n- Consider using the two 1s in a way that doesn't change the value of the multiplication significantly.\n- One approach is to add the two 1s together to get 2, and then multiply by 12.\n\nLet's try this approach:\n\n1. Add the two 1s: 1 + 1 = 2\n2. Multiply the result by 12: 2 * 12 = 24\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and achieves the desired result of 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(1 + 1) * 12>>>"
