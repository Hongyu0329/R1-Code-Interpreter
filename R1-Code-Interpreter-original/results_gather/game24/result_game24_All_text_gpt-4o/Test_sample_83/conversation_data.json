    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 9 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 6, 9, and 9.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try different approaches:\n\n- **Approach 1**: Start with multiplication and addition.\n  - Try multiplying two numbers and then adding the others.\n  - Example: (3 * 9) + 9 - 6 = 27 + 9 - 6 = 30 (not 24)\n\n- **Approach 2**: Use division to simplify.\n  - Try dividing one number by another and then using the result.\n  - Example: (9 / 3) = 3, then 3 * 6 = 18, 18 + 9 = 27 (not 24)\n\n- **Approach 3**: Use subtraction to adjust the total.\n  - Example: 9 + 9 = 18, 18 - 6 = 12, 12 * 3 = 36 (not 24)\n\n- **Approach 4**: Combine operations strategically.\n  - Example: (9 - 3) = 6, then 6 * 6 = 36, 36 - 9 = 27 (not 24)\n\n- **Approach 5**: Re-evaluate combinations.\n  - Example: (9 / 9) = 1, then 1 * 6 = 6, 6 + 3 = 9 (not 24)\n\nAfter trying various combinations, let's try a different approach:\n\n- **Approach 6**: Use multiplication and addition in a different order.\n  - Example: (3 + 9) = 12, then 12 * 2 = 24 (where 2 is obtained by 6 / 3)\n\nThis approach works because:\n- We use 3 and 9 to get 12.\n- We use 6 divided by 3 to get 2.\n- We multiply 12 by 2 to get 24.\n\nThus, the correct equation is: ((3 + 9) * (6 / 3)) = 24\n\nFinal answer: <<<((3 + 9) * (6 / 3))>>>"
