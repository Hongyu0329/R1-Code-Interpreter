    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 6, and 11 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 6s, which can be useful for multiplication or addition.\n2. The number 11 is relatively large, so it might be useful in addition or subtraction.\n3. The number 1 can be used to adjust the result slightly, either by addition or subtraction.\n\nNow, let's try to combine these numbers step by step:\n\n- Start by considering the larger number, 11, and see how it can be combined with others.\n- We can try to use multiplication to reach a higher number, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. Multiply 6 and 6: \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n2. Subtract 11 from 36: \\(36 - 11 = 25\\)\n3. Subtract 1 from 25: \\(25 - 1 = 24\\)\n\nThis combination uses all numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<((6*6)-11-1)>>>"
