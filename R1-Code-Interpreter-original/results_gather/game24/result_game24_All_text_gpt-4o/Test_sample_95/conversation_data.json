    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 7, and 8 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 5, 5, 7, and 8.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Start by considering combinations that involve multiplication and addition, as these are often effective in reaching a target number like 24.\n   - Consider using multiplication to increase the value quickly, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\n4. **Try different groupings and operations**:\n   - One possible approach is to multiply two numbers and then adjust the result with the remaining numbers.\n   - Another approach is to add or subtract numbers first, then multiply or divide.\n\n5. **Test combinations**:\n   - Try multiplying 5 and 5: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\). This is close to 24, so we need to adjust by subtracting 1.\n   - We can achieve this by using the remaining numbers 7 and 8.\n   - Consider: \\(25 - (8 - 7) = 25 - 1 = 24\\).\n\n6. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Check that each number is used exactly once: 5, 5, 7, and 8 are all used.\n   - Ensure the operations are valid and lead to the correct result.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\\[\n(5 \\times 5) - (8 - 7) = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<(5 * 5) - (8 - 7)>>>"
