    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 2, 2, 3, and 8, we need to carefully consider how to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and operations available:**\n   - Numbers: 2, 2, 3, 8\n   - Operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)\n\n2. **Consider possible combinations:**\n   - We need to use each number exactly once and combine them to get 24.\n\n3. **Try different operations and combinations:**\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n   - Consider using division to adjust the value if it becomes too large.\n\n4. **Experiment with combinations:**\n   - Try multiplying the larger numbers first: 8 * 3 = 24. This is promising because it directly gives us 24.\n   - Now, we need to incorporate the two 2s into the equation without changing the result.\n\n5. **Incorporate the remaining numbers:**\n   - We can use the two 2s in a way that doesn't alter the result of 24. For example, we can multiply them together and then divide by 1 (which doesn't change the value):\n     - (8 * 3) = 24\n     - (2 / 2) = 1\n     - 24 * 1 = 24\n\n6. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure all numbers are used: 2, 2, 3, 8\n   - Ensure the operations are valid and lead to 24.\n\nThe final solution is:\n- (8 * 3) * (2 / 2) = 24\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<(8 * 3) * (2 / 2)>>>"
