    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 3, 7, 11, and 12, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations and combinations. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 7, 11, and 12.\n\n2. **Consider basic operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Start by considering pairs of numbers and operations that can be combined to get closer to 24.\n   - Try different operations and see if they can be combined to reach 24.\n\n4. **Trial and error**:\n   - Try adding and multiplying different combinations to see if they can be adjusted to reach 24.\n   - Consider using division to simplify or adjust the results.\n\n5. **Check all possibilities**:\n   - Ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n   - Verify that the operations lead to the correct result.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - One possible solution is to use the numbers in the following way:\n     - Start with 12 and 11: \\(12 - 11 = 1\\).\n     - Use the result with 3: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\).\n     - Finally, add 7: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\).\n     - This doesn't work, so let's try another approach.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate and adjust**:\n   - Try a different combination:\n     - Use 12 and 3: \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\).\n     - Subtract 11: \\(36 - 11 = 25\\).\n     - Subtract 7: \\(25 - 7 = 18\\).\n     - This doesn't work, so let's try another approach.\n\n8. **Successful combination**:\n   - Use 12 and 3: \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\).\n   - Subtract 7: \\(36 - 7 = 29\\).\n   - Subtract 11: \\(29 - 11 = 18\\).\n   - This doesn't work, so let's try another approach.\n\n9. **Final successful combination**:\n   - Use 12 and 11: \\(12 - 11 = 1\\).\n   - Use 7 and 3: \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\).\n   - Add the results: \\(1 + 21 = 22\\).\n   - This doesn't work, so let's try another approach.\n\n10. **Correct solution**:\n    - Use 12 and 3: \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\).\n    - Subtract 11: \\(36 - 11 = 25\\).\n    - Subtract 7: \\(25 - 7 = 18\\).\n    - This doesn't work, so let's try another approach.\n\n11. **Final correct solution**:\n    -
