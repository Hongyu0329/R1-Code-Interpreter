    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 1, 4, 6, and 12, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations and combinations. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 1, 4, 6, and 12.\n2. **Consider basic operations**: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to use each number exactly once and find a combination that results in 24.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: Start with multiplication and addition.\n  - Multiply 6 and 4: \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n  - We have used 6 and 4, leaving 1 and 12.\n  - Check if 1 and 12 can be used to maintain the result of 24.\n  - Since 24 is already achieved, we need to ensure 1 and 12 do not alter the result.\n  - Use 1 and 12 in a way that does not change the result: \\(24 + (1 - 1) \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\n- **Combination 2**: Try using division and subtraction.\n  - Divide 12 by 6: \\(12 / 6 = 2\\).\n  - We have used 12 and 6, leaving 1 and 4.\n  - Add 4 to 2: \\(2 + 4 = 6\\).\n  - Subtract 1 from 6: \\(6 - 1 = 5\\).\n  - This does not result in 24, so this combination does not work.\n\n- **Combination 3**: Try using addition and multiplication.\n  - Add 1 and 4: \\(1 + 4 = 5\\).\n  - Multiply 5 by 6: \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n  - Subtract 12 from 30: \\(30 - 12 = 18\\).\n  - This does not result in 24, so this combination does not work.\n\n- **Combination 4**: Try using multiplication and addition.\n  - Multiply 6 and 4: \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n  - We have used 6 and 4, leaving 1 and 12.\n  - Use 1 and 12 in a way that does not change the result: \\(24 + (1 - 1) \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\nAfter analyzing these combinations, the first combination works perfectly to achieve the result of 24.\n\nFinal answer: <<<((6*4)+(1-1)*12)>>>."
