    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 6, 12, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. **Identify potential operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\n3. **Start with multiplication and division**: These operations can quickly increase or decrease the value, which might help in reaching 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings**: Use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps in reaching the target.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: \n  - Start with multiplication: 5 * 6 = 30\n  - Subtract 12: 30 - 12 = 18\n  - Add 13: 18 + 13 = 31 (This is not 24)\n\n- **Combination 2**:\n  - Start with addition: 12 + 13 = 25\n  - Subtract 6: 25 - 6 = 19\n  - Add 5: 19 + 5 = 24 (This is 24)\n\n- **Combination 3**:\n  - Start with addition: 5 + 6 = 11\n  - Add 13: 11 + 13 = 24\n  - Subtract 12: 24 - 12 = 12 (This is not 24)\n\n- **Combination 4**:\n  - Start with multiplication: 6 * 5 = 30\n  - Subtract 13: 30 - 13 = 17\n  - Add 12: 17 + 12 = 29 (This is not 24)\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we find that the second combination gives us the desired result:\n\n12 + 13 = 25\n25 - 6 = 19\n19 + 5 = 24\n\nTherefore, the correct equation using the numbers 5, 6, 12, and 13 to obtain 24 is:\n\n<<<(12 + 13) - 6 + 5>>>"
