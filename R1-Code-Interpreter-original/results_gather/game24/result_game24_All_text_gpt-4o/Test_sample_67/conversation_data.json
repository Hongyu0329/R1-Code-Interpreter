    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 7, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations and the order of operations (parentheses) to ensure each number is used exactly once.\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: 1, 2, 5, 7.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n   - Try to use subtraction or division to adjust the total to exactly 24.\n\n4. **Step-by-step exploration**:\n   - Consider using multiplication to reach a higher number, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - For example, multiplying 5 and 7 gives 35, which is too high, but we can adjust by subtracting or dividing.\n   - Try using 2 and 1 to adjust the result of 5 and 7.\n\n5. **Formulate a potential solution**:\n   - Calculate: (5 * 7) = 35.\n   - Subtract 2: 35 - 2 = 33.\n   - Subtract 1: 33 - 1 = 32.\n   - This approach doesn't work, so try another combination.\n\n6. **Re-evaluate and try a different approach**:\n   - Consider using division to reduce the number.\n   - Try: (7 - 5) = 2.\n   - Multiply by 2: 2 * 2 = 4.\n   - Add 1: 4 + 1 = 5.\n   - This approach doesn't work, so try another combination.\n\n7. **Try another combination**:\n   - Consider: (7 * 2) = 14.\n   - Add 5: 14 + 5 = 19.\n   - Add 1: 19 + 1 = 20.\n   - This approach doesn't work, so try another combination.\n\n8. **Final successful combination**:\n   - Consider: (7 - 1) = 6.\n   - Multiply by 5: 6 * 5 = 30.\n   - Subtract 2: 30 - 2 = 28.\n   - This approach doesn't work, so try another combination.\n\n9. **Re-evaluate and try a different approach**:\n   - Consider: (5 * 2) = 10.\n   - Add 7: 10 + 7 = 17.\n   - Add 1: 17 + 1 = 18.\n   - This approach doesn't work, so try another combination.\n\n10. **Final successful combination**:\n    - Consider: (7 - 1) = 6.\n    - Multiply by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.\n    -
