    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 4, 7, and 8 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 4, 7, 8.\n2. We need to use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/) to reach 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers like 24.\n- Try multiplying two numbers first, then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 24.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n1. Multiply 4 and 7: 4 * 7 = 28\n   - 28 is too high, so we need to reduce it by using subtraction or division.\n\n2. Try using 8 and 1:\n   - 8 - 1 = 7\n\n3. Now, use the result of 8 - 1 with the previous multiplication:\n   - 28 - 7 = 21 (not 24)\n\n4. Try another approach:\n   - Multiply 8 and 4: 8 * 4 = 32\n   - Subtract 7: 32 - 7 = 25\n   - Subtract 1: 25 - 1 = 24\n\nThis combination works, as it uses all numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(8 * 4) - 7 - 1>>>"
