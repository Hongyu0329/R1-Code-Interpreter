    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 10, 10, and 10 to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 6, 10, 10, and 10.\n2. **Objective**: Use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 24.\n3. **Constraints**: Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nNow, let's try to find a combination of operations that will yield 24:\n\n- Start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers.\n- Since we have three 10s, we can try to use them in a way that simplifies the calculation.\n- Consider using multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: \n  - Use multiplication to increase the value: \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\).\n  - Now, we have 100, 10, and 6 left.\n  - Try to adjust the result using subtraction and division: \n    - \\(100 - 10 = 90\\).\n    - \\(90 / 6 = 15\\) (not 24, so this doesn't work).\n\n- **Combination 2**:\n  - Use addition and multiplication:\n  - \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n  - Now, we have 20, 10, and 6 left.\n  - Try to adjust the result using multiplication:\n    - \\(20 + 6 = 26\\).\n    - \\(26 - 10 = 16\\) (not 24, so this doesn't work).\n\n- **Combination 3**:\n  - Use multiplication and subtraction:\n  - \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\).\n  - Now, we have 60, 10, and 10 left.\n  - Try to adjust the result using subtraction:\n    - \\(60 - 10 = 50\\).\n    - \\(50 - 10 = 40\\) (not 24, so this doesn't work).\n\n- **Combination 4**:\n  - Use division and addition:\n  - \\(10 / 10 = 1\\).\n  - Now, we have 1, 10, and 6 left.\n  - Try to adjust the result using multiplication:\n    - \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\).\n    - \\(6 + 10 = 16\\) (not 24, so this doesn't work).\n\n- **Combination 5**:\n  - Use addition and division:\n  - \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n  - Now, we have 20, 10, and 6 left.\n  - Try to adjust the result using division:\n    - \\(20 / 10 = 2\\).\n    - \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) (not 24, so this doesn't work).\n\n- **Combination 6**:\n  - Use addition and multiplication:\n  - \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n  - Now, we have 20, 10, and 6 left.\n  - Try to adjust the result using multiplication:\n    - \\(20 \\times 6 = 120\\).\n    - \\(120 / 10 = 12\\) (not 24, so this doesn't work).\n\n- **Combination 7**:\n  - Use addition and multiplication:\n  - \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n  - Now, we have 20, 10, and 6 left.\n  - Try to adjust the result using multiplication:\n    - \\(20 - 10 = 10\\).\n    - \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\) (not 24, so this doesn't work).\n\n- **Combination 8**:\n  - Use addition and multiplication:\n  - \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n  - Now, we have 20, 10, and 6 left.\n  - Try to adjust the result using multiplication:\n    - \\(20 - 6 = 14\\).\n    - \\(14 + 10 = 24\\) (this works).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is:\n\\[\n(10 + 10) - 6 + 10 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(10 + 10) - 6 + 10 = 24>>>"
