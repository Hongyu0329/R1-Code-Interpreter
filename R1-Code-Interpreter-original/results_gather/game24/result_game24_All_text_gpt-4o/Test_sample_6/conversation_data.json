    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 24.\n\n2. **Consider the Numbers**: We have 1, 1, 2, and 13.\n\n3. **Explore Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering the largest number, 13, and how it can be used to reach 24.\n   - Since 13 is a little more than half of 24, consider doubling it: \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\).\n   - We need to adjust this result to reach exactly 24.\n\n4. **Adjust the Result**:\n   - From 26, we need to subtract 2 to reach 24.\n   - We have two 1s available, which can be combined to make 2: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n5. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   - Use the numbers and operations to form the equation: \\((13 \\times 2) - (1 + 1) = 24\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\)\n     - \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n     - \\(26 - 2 = 24\\)\n\nThe equation satisfies the requirement of using each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nFinal answer: <<<((13 * 2) - (1 + 1))>>>."
