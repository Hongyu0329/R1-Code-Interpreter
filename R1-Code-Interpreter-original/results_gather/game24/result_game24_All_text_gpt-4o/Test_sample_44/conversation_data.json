    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 4, 6, and 8 exactly once each, along with basic arithmetic operations, to obtain the result of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Identify potential operations and combinations:**\n   - We have the numbers 1, 4, 6, and 8.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider multiplication and division first:**\n   - Multiplication and division can quickly increase or decrease the value, which might help in reaching 24.\n   - Try multiplying two numbers: 6 * 4 = 24. This is promising because it directly gives us 24.\n\n3. **Incorporate the remaining numbers:**\n   - We have used 6 and 4, leaving us with 1 and 8.\n   - We need to use 1 and 8 in a way that doesn't alter the result of 24 from 6 * 4.\n\n4. **Explore ways to incorporate 1 and 8:**\n   - Since 6 * 4 = 24, we can try to add or subtract 1 and 8 in a way that maintains the result.\n   - Consider using 1 as a neutral element in multiplication: 1 * (6 * 4) = 24.\n   - Now, we need to incorporate 8. We can use it in a way that doesn't change the result, such as adding and subtracting it: (1 * (6 * 4)) + 8 - 8 = 24.\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - The expression (1 * (6 * 4)) + 8 - 8 simplifies to 24, as the addition and subtraction of 8 cancel each other out.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(1 * (6 * 4)) + 8 - 8>>>"
