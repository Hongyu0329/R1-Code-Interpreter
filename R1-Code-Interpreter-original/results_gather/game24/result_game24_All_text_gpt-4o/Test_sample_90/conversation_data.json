    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 6, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 6s, which can be useful for multiplication or addition.\n2. The number 8 is relatively large, so it might be useful in addition or multiplication.\n3. The number 4 is smaller, so it might be useful in subtraction or division.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value:\n  - 6 * 4 = 24, but we still have 6 and 8 left, which doesn't help.\n  - 6 * 6 = 36, which is too large, but let's see if we can adjust it:\n    - 36 - 8 = 28, which is still too large.\n    - 36 / 6 = 6, which doesn't help.\n    - 36 - 4 = 32, which is still too large.\n\n- Consider using addition and subtraction:\n  - 8 + 6 = 14, then:\n    - 14 + 6 = 20, and 20 + 4 = 24, but this doesn't use all numbers correctly.\n    - 14 + 4 = 18, and 18 + 6 = 24, but this doesn't use all numbers correctly.\n\n- Consider using division:\n  - 8 / 4 = 2, then:\n    - 2 * 6 = 12, and 12 + 6 = 18, which doesn't work.\n    - 2 + 6 = 8, and 8 + 6 = 14, which doesn't work.\n\n- Try a different approach:\n  - Use subtraction to adjust the total:\n    - 6 + 6 = 12, then:\n      - 12 + 8 = 20, and 20 + 4 = 24, but this doesn't use all numbers correctly.\n      - 12 + 4 = 16, and 16 + 8 = 24, but this doesn't use all numbers correctly.\n\n- Try using subtraction and addition together:\n  - 8 - 4 = 4, then:\n    - 4 + 6 = 10, and 10 + 6 = 16, which doesn't work.\n    - 4 + 6 = 10, and 10 + 6 = 16, which doesn't work.\n\n- Finally, try a combination of operations:\n  - 6 * 4 = 24, then:\n    - 24 - 6 = 18, and 18 + 6 = 24, but this doesn't use all numbers correctly.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, the correct solution is:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition:\n  - (6 / (8 - 6)) * 4 = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((6/(8-6))*4)>>>"
