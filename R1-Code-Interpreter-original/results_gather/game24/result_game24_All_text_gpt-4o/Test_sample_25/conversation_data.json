    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the target**: We need to reach the number 24.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Use each number once**: We have to use the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 12 exactly once in our calculations.\n\n4. **Explore combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers like 24.\n- Consider using multiplication to get close to 24, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nTry the following steps:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 6: \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n- Subtract 12 from 30: \\(30 - 12 = 18\\).\n- Add 1 to 18: \\(18 + 1 = 19\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n- Subtract 1 from 30: \\(30 - 1 = 29\\).\n- Subtract 12 from 29: \\(29 - 12 = 17\\).\n\nThis also doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n- Subtract 6 from 30: \\(30 - 6 = 24\\).\n- Add 1: \\(24 + 1 = 25\\).\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n- Subtract 12: \\(30 - 12 = 18\\).\n- Add 1: \\(18 + 1 = 19\\).\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n- Subtract 1: \\(30 - 1 = 29\\).\n- Subtract 12: \\(29 - 12 = 17\\).\n\nThis doesn't work.
