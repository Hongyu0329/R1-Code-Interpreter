    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 6, 8, 10, and 12, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations and combinations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n\n2. **Consider basic operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to use each number exactly once and find a combination that results in 24.\n\n4. **Try different operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease values.\n   - Consider using addition and subtraction to adjust the total to 24.\n\n5. **Test potential solutions**:\n   - One possible approach is to use multiplication to get close to 24 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - Another approach is to use division to simplify the numbers and then use addition or multiplication.\n\n6. **Calculate step by step**:\n   - Let's try multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the others:\n     - Multiply 6 and 4 (since 4 is a factor of 24): 6 * 4 = 24.\n     - We need to form 4 using the remaining numbers 8, 10, and 12.\n     - Notice that 12 - 8 = 4.\n\n7. **Combine the steps**:\n   - Use the subtraction to form 4: (12 - 8) = 4.\n   - Multiply the result by 6: 6 * 4 = 24.\n\n8. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Ensure all numbers are used: 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n   - The operations used are valid and lead to the correct result.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<((12 - 8) * 6)>>>."
