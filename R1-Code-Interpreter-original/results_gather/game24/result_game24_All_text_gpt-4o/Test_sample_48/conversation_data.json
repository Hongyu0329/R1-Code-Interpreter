    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 7, 9, 11, and 11 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 7, 9, 11, and 11.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: We must ensure that each number is used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\nNow, let's try to find a combination of operations that will yield 24:\n\n- Start by considering the use of multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Notice that we have two 11s, which can be used to simplify calculations.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Use the two 11s: \\(11 + 11 = 22\\).\n- Add 2 more to reach 24: \\(22 + 2 = 24\\).\n- We need to form 2 using the remaining numbers 7 and 9.\n\nTo form 2 using 7 and 9:\n\n- Subtract 7 from 9: \\(9 - 7 = 2\\).\n\nNow, combine these steps:\n\n1. Calculate \\(11 + 11 = 22\\).\n2. Calculate \\(9 - 7 = 2\\).\n3. Add the results: \\(22 + 2 = 24\\).\n\nThis satisfies all conditions: each number is used exactly once, and the result is 24.\n\nFinal answer: <<<((11 + 11) + (9 - 7))>>>."
