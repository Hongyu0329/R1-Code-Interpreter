    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 6, 6, 12, and 12, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations and combinations. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 6, 6, 12, and 12.\n2. **Consider basic operations**: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n- **Step 1**: Consider using multiplication and division to simplify the problem. Since 12 is a multiple of 6, we can use division to simplify:\n  - \\(12 / 6 = 2\\)\n\n- **Step 2**: Now, we have the numbers 2, 6, and 12 left to use. Consider using multiplication:\n  - \\(2 * 12 = 24\\)\n\n- **Step 3**: We have used 12, 6, and 12, and we need to incorporate the remaining 6. We can use addition:\n  - \\(24 + 0 = 24\\) (where 0 is derived from \\(6 - 6\\))\n\nThus, the equation that uses all numbers and results in 24 is:\n\\[\n((12 / 6) * 12) + (6 - 6) = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<((12 / 6) * 12) + (6 - 6)>>>"
