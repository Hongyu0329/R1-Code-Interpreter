    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 11 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 8, 11, and 11.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: We must ensure that each number is used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\nNow, let's try to find a combination of operations that will yield 24:\n\n- Start by considering the use of multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Notice that we have two 11s, which can be useful for multiplication or addition.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: Use multiplication and addition.\n  - Try multiplying 11 by 2 (since we have two 11s, we can use one 11 and another number to make 2).\n  - 11 * 2 = 22\n  - We need 2 more to reach 24, so consider adding 3 and subtracting 1 (since 8 - 7 = 1).\n  - 22 + 3 - 1 = 24\n\n- **Combination 2**: Use division and addition.\n  - Consider dividing 8 by 2 to get 4.\n  - 8 / 2 = 4\n  - Multiply 4 by 6 (using 3 and 11 to make 6).\n  - 4 * 6 = 24\n\n- **Combination 3**: Use subtraction and addition.\n  - Subtract 3 from 11 to get 8.\n  - 11 - 3 = 8\n  - Add 8 to 11 to get 19.\n  - 8 + 11 = 19\n  - Add 5 (using 8 - 3) to get 24.\n  - 19 + 5 = 24\n\nAfter testing these combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- **Final Equation**: (11 + 11) + (8 - 3) = 24\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<(11 + 11) + (8 - 3)>>>"
