    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 10, 13, 13, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have three 13s and one 10.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try different approaches:\n\n- **Approach 1**: Start with addition and subtraction.\n  - If we add two 13s: 13 + 13 = 26\n  - Subtract 10 from 26: 26 - 10 = 16\n  - We still have one 13 left, and 16 + 13 = 29, which is too high.\n\n- **Approach 2**: Try multiplication and division.\n  - Multiply two 13s: 13 * 13 = 169, which is too high.\n  - Divide 13 by 13: 13 / 13 = 1\n  - Add 10 to 1: 1 + 10 = 11\n  - Add the remaining 13: 11 + 13 = 24\n\nThis approach works. We used each number exactly once and achieved the target of 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<((13/13) + 10 + 13)>>>."
