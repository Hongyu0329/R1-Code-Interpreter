    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 8, 9, 11, and 12, we need to carefully analyze the possible combinations and operations. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 8, 9, 11, and 12.\n2. **Consider basic operations**: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\nLet's try different combinations and operations:\n\n- **Step 1**: Consider using multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers like 24.\n- **Step 2**: Try to form intermediate results that are close to 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- **Combine 11 and 12**: \n  - 11 + 12 = 23\n- **Use 9 and 8**:\n  - 9 - 8 = 1\n- **Combine the results**:\n  - 23 + 1 = 24\n\nThis combination uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(11 + 12) + (9 - 8)>>>"
