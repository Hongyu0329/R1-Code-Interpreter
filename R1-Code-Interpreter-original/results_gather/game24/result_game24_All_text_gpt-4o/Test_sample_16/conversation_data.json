    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 6, 7, 12, and 12, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations and combinations. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 6, 7, 12, and 12.\n2. **Consider basic operations**: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n  - Try multiplying the two 12s: \\(12 \\times 12 = 144\\).\n  - This is too large, so let's try a different approach.\n\n- **Combination 2**: Consider using division to reduce the numbers.\n  - Try dividing one of the 12s by 6: \\(12 / 6 = 2\\).\n  - Now we have 2, 7, and 12 left.\n\n- **Combination 3**: Use the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n  - Multiply 7 by 2: \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\).\n  - Add the remaining 12: \\(14 + 12 = 26\\).\n  - This is too large, so let's try a different approach.\n\n- **Combination 4**: Re-evaluate the use of division and subtraction.\n  - Divide 12 by 6: \\(12 / 6 = 2\\).\n  - Subtract this result from 7: \\(7 - 2 = 5\\).\n  - Multiply the result by the remaining 12: \\(5 \\times 12 = 60\\).\n  - This is too large, so let's try a different approach.\n\n- **Combination 5**: Reconsider the use of addition and multiplication.\n  - Add 6 and 12: \\(6 + 12 = 18\\).\n  - Subtract 7 from 18: \\(18 - 7 = 11\\).\n  - Multiply the result by the remaining 12: \\(11 \\times 12 = 132\\).\n  - This is too large, so let's try a different approach.\n\n- **Combination 6**: Try a different sequence of operations.\n  - Multiply 6 by 7: \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\).\n  - Subtract 12: \\(42 - 12 = 30\\).\n  - Subtract the remaining 12: \\(30 - 12 = 18\\).\n  - This is too small, so let's try a different approach.\n\n- **Combination 7**: Re-evaluate the use of all operations.\n  - Multiply 6 by 12: \\(6 \\times 12 = 72\\).\n  - Divide 72 by 12: \\(72 / 12 = 6\\).\n  - Add 7: \\(6 + 7 = 13\\).\n  - This is too small, so let's try a different approach.\n\n- **Combination 8**: Try a different sequence of operations.\n  - Multiply 6 by 12: \\(6 \\times 12 = 72\\).\n  - Divide 72 by 12: \\(72 / 12 = 6\\).\n  - Add 7: \\(6 + 7 = 13\\).\n  - This is too small, so let's try a different approach.\n\n- **Combination 9**: Try a different sequence of operations.\n  -
