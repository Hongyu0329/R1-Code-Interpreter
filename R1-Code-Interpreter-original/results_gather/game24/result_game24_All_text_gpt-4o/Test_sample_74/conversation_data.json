    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 8, 9, 10, and 13, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations and combinations. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Identify possible operations and combinations:**\n   - We can try different combinations of these numbers with the four basic operations.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Try different combinations:**\n   - Start by testing simple operations and gradually increase complexity.\n   - Consider using multiplication and division first, as they can quickly increase or decrease values.\n\n3. **Test combinations:**\n   - Try combining numbers in pairs and then combining the results.\n   - For example, try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the result from another number.\n\n4. **Check for valid operations:**\n   - Ensure that division operations do not result in fractions unless they are necessary to reach 24.\n   - Ensure that all numbers are used exactly once.\n\n5. **Iterate and adjust:**\n   - If a combination does not work, adjust the order of operations or try a different set of operations.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Start with the numbers 8 and 10: \\(8 \\times 10 = 80\\).\n- Subtract 13 from 80: \\(80 - 13 = 67\\).\n- Subtract 9 from 67: \\(67 - 9 = 58\\).\n- This approach does not work, so let's try another combination.\n\nAnother approach:\n\n- Start with 13 and 9: \\(13 - 9 = 4\\).\n- Multiply the result by 8: \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\).\n- Subtract 10 from 32: \\(32 - 10 = 22\\).\n- This approach also does not work, so let's try another combination.\n\nFinally, a successful combination:\n\n- Start with 13 and 10: \\(13 + 10 = 23\\).\n- Add 9 to 23: \\(23 + 9 = 32\\).\n- Subtract 8 from 32: \\(32 - 8 = 24\\).\n\nThis combination successfully uses all numbers and results in 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<((13 + 10) + 9) - 8 = 24>>>."
