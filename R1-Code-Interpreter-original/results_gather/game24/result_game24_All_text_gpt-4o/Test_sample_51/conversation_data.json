    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 8, 10, and 11 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 2, 8, 10, and 11.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\n4. **Check for possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering addition and multiplication, as they can quickly increase the value.\n   - Consider subtraction and division to adjust the total to exactly 24.\n\n5. **Try different groupings and operations**:\n   - One possible approach is to try combining numbers to get close to 24 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\n6. **Trial and error**:\n   - Let's try combining 10 and 11 first, as they are the largest numbers.\n   - 10 + 11 = 21. We need to reach 24, so we need an additional 3.\n   - We have 2 and 8 left. Notice that 8 - 2 = 6.\n   - If we divide 6 by 2, we get 3, which is what we need to add to 21 to get 24.\n\n7. **Construct the equation**:\n   - Use the operations in the correct order to ensure the result is 24.\n   - ((10 + 11) + (8 / (8 - 2))) = 24\n\n8. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 10 + 11 = 21\n     - 8 - 2 = 6\n     - 8 / 6 = 1.333 (This doesn't work as expected, so let's try another approach)\n   - Let's try another approach:\n     - 10 + 11 = 21\n     - 8 - 2 = 6\n     - 21 + (8 - 6) = 21 + 2 = 23 (This also doesn't work, let's try another approach)\n   - Let's try another approach:\n     - 10 + 11 = 21\n     -
