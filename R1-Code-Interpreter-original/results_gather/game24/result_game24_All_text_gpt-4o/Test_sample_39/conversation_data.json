    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 11, 11, and 11 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 2, 11, 11, and 11.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n\nLet's try different approaches:\n\n- **Approach 1**: Start with multiplication and addition.\n  - If we multiply two 11s, we get 121, which is too large.\n  - If we add two 11s, we get 22, which is close to 24.\n\n- **Approach 2**: Use subtraction to adjust the result.\n  - If we add two 11s to get 22, we can add 2 to get 24.\n  - This gives us: (11 + 11) + 2 = 24.\n\n- **Approach 3**: Consider other combinations.\n  - Using division doesn't seem to help as dividing 11 by 11 gives 1, which doesn't help in reaching 24.\n  - Multiplying 11 by 2 gives 22, and adding another 11 gives 33, which is too large.\n\nAfter analyzing these approaches, the most straightforward solution is:\n\n- Add two 11s to get 22.\n- Add 2 to 22 to get 24.\n\nThus, the equation is: (11 + 11) + 2 = 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<((11 + 11) + 2)>>>."
