    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 3, 12, and 12 to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 12s, which can be useful for multiplication or addition to reach higher numbers.\n2. The number 3 can be used to divide or multiply to adjust the result.\n3. The number 2 can be used to divide or multiply to adjust the result.\n\nNow, let's try to form an equation:\n\n- Start by considering the multiplication of the two 12s: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n- We can use the remaining numbers 3 and 2 to adjust the result.\n\nLet's try to form an equation:\n\n1. Multiply the two 12s: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n2. Use the number 3 to divide one of the 12s: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\).\n3. Multiply the result by 2: \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n4. Add the result to the other 12: \\(8 + 12 = 20\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n1. Multiply 12 by 2: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n2. Use the number 3 to divide one of the 12s: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\).\n3. Add the result to the other 12: \\(4 + 12 = 16\\).\n\nThis approach also doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n1. Multiply 12 by 2: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n2. Use the number 3 to divide one of the 12s: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\).\n3.
