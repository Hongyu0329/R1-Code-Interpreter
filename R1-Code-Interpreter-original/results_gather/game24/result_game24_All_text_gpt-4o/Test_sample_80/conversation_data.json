    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 10, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 2s, which can be used to either add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Since they are the same, they might be useful in multiplication or division to simplify the equation.\n\n2. The number 10 is relatively large compared to 2, so it might be useful in addition or multiplication to reach closer to 24.\n\n3. The number 13 is also large, and it can be used in addition or subtraction to adjust the total.\n\nNow, let's try to combine these numbers step by step:\n\n- Start by considering the largest numbers, 10 and 13. Adding them gives 23, which is close to 24.\n- We need to add 1 to 23 to reach 24. We can achieve this by using the two 2s.\n- Notice that (2/2) equals 1. This operation uses both 2s and results in the number 1.\n- Now, add this result to the sum of 10 and 13.\n\nThe equation becomes: (10 + 13) + (2 / 2) = 23 + 1 = 24.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(10 + 13) + (2 / 2)>>>."
