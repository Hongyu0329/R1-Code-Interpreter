    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 8, 10, and 10 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 4, 8, 10, and 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one results in 24.\n\n4. **Trial and error**:\n   - Start by considering the use of multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers quickly.\n   - Consider using subtraction to adjust the total to exactly 24.\n\n5. **Possible solution**:\n   - One possible approach is to use multiplication to increase the value and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - Try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n\n6. **Testing combinations**:\n   - Let's try: (10 * 4) - (10 + 8)\n   - Calculate: 10 * 4 = 40\n   - Then: 40 - 10 = 30\n   - Finally: 30 - 8 = 22 (This does not work)\n\n7. **Adjust and retry**:\n   - Try: (10 + 10) + (8 - 4)\n   - Calculate: 10 + 10 = 20\n   - Then: 8 - 4 = 4\n   - Finally: 20 + 4 = 24 (This works)\n\n8. **Verify**:\n   - Ensure all numbers are used: 4, 8, 10, 10.\n   - Ensure the operations are correct and result in 24.\n\nThe correct equation is: (10 + 10) + (8 - 4) = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(10 + 10) + (8 - 4)>>>"
