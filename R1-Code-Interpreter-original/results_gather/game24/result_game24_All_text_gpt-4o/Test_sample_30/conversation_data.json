    "To solve the problem of obtaining 24 using the numbers 6, 6, 10, and 13, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations and combinations. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 6, 6, 10, and 13.\n2. **Consider basic operations**: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n- **Try multiplication and addition**: \n  - If we multiply 6 and 6, we get 36. \n  - If we add 10 and 13, we get 23. \n  - These results are not directly useful as they don't lead to 24.\n\n- **Try division and subtraction**:\n  - If we divide 13 by 6, we get a fraction, which is not useful.\n  - If we subtract 10 from 13, we get 3, which might be useful.\n\n- **Try combinations of operations**:\n  - Consider using multiplication and addition:\n    - Multiply 6 by 4 to get 24. We need to form 4 using the remaining numbers.\n    - We can form 4 by subtracting 10 from 6: (10 - 6) = 4.\n    - Therefore, the expression becomes: 6 * (10 - 6) = 24.\n\nThis combination uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6 * (10 - 6)>>>."
