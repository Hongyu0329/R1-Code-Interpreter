    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 7, 10, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 7, 10, 12.\n2. We need to use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/) to reach 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how it can be combined with others.\n- Try adding 12 to another number to get closer to 24. For example, 12 + 10 = 22, which is close to 24.\n- We need to add 2 more to reach 24. We have the numbers 1 and 7 left.\n- Consider using multiplication or division to adjust the remaining numbers.\n- If we use 1 and 7, we can try: 1 * 2 = 2, which can be added to 22 to make 24.\n- However, we need to use all numbers exactly once.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using multiplication to reach a higher number quickly.\n- Try multiplying 7 and 10: 7 * 10 = 70.\n- Now, we need to adjust this result to get 24.\n- Consider dividing by 12: 70 / 12 is not an integer, so this doesn't work.\n- Try another combination: 12 * 2 = 24, which is exactly what we need.\n- Now, we need to use the remaining numbers 1 and 7.\n- We can use 1 as a neutral element in multiplication: 1 * (12 * 2) = 24.\n- We have used 1, 2, 12, and 7 in the operations.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the correct approach is:\n\n- Use 12 and 2 to directly get 24: 12 * 2 = 24.\n- Use 1 as a neutral element in multiplication: 1 * (12 * 2) = 24.\n- Use 7 in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as adding zero: 7 - 7 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(12 * 2) + (1 * (7 - 7))>>>"
