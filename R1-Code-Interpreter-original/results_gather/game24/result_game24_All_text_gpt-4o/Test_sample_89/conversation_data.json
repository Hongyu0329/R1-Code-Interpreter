    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 4, 11, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations step by step:\n\n1. **Identify possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers with the operations to reach 24.\n\n3. **Start with multiplication and addition**: These operations are often useful in reaching a target number like 24.\n\n4. **Try different groupings**: Grouping numbers with parentheses can change the order of operations and help reach the desired result.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: \n  - Start with multiplication: 3 * 4 = 12\n  - Add 12: 12 + 12 = 24\n  - Use 11: 11 is not used, so this doesn't work.\n\n- **Combination 2**:\n  - Start with addition: 11 + 12 = 23\n  - Add 3: 23 + 3 = 26\n  - Use 4: 26 - 4 = 22, so this doesn't work.\n\n- **Combination 3**:\n  - Start with addition: 11 + 3 = 14\n  - Add 4: 14 + 4 = 18\n  - Add 12: 18 + 12 = 30, so this doesn't work.\n\n- **Combination 4**:\n  - Start with multiplication: 3 * 4 = 12\n  - Add 11: 12 + 11 = 23\n  - Add 12: 23 + 12 = 35, so this doesn't work.\n\n- **Combination 5**:\n  - Start with addition: 11 + 12 = 23\n  - Subtract 3: 23 - 3 = 20\n  - Add 4: 20 + 4 = 24\n\nThis combination works, and all numbers are used exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((11 + 12) - 3) + 4>>>"
