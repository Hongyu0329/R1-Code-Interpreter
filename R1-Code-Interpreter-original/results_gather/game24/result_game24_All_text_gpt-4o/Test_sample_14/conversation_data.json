    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 7, 7, 11, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\n3. **Start with simple operations**: \n   - Check if any simple addition or multiplication of these numbers can directly give 24. \n   - For example, 7 + 7 = 14, 11 + 12 = 23, 7 * 3 = 21, etc.\n\n4. **Try combinations**:\n   - Since 7 + 7 = 14, we can try to use the remaining numbers 11 and 12 to adjust this to 24.\n   - Consider using multiplication or division to adjust the result.\n\n5. **Experiment with operations**:\n   - One possible approach is to use multiplication to increase the value of 7 or 11.\n   - For example, 7 * 11 = 77, which is too high, but we can try to adjust it with division or subtraction.\n\n6. **Refine the approach**:\n   - Try using division to reduce the result of a multiplication.\n   - For example, (7 * 12) = 84, and then try to adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\n7. **Find a working combination**:\n   - After testing various combinations, one that works is:\n     - (7 * (12 - 11)) + 7 = 7 * 1 + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14, which is incorrect.\n     - Adjust the approach to find a correct combination.\n\n8. **Correct approach**:\n   - Use the numbers in a way that balances the operations to reach exactly 24.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the correct solution is:\n\n- ((7 * 12) / (11 - 7)) = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((7 * 12) / (11 - 7))>>>"
