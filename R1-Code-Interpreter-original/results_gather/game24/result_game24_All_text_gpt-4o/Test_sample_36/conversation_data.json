    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 12, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 8, 12, and 12.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: We must ensure that each number is used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\nNow, let's try to find a combination of operations that will yield 24:\n\n- Start by considering the numbers 12 and 12. Multiplying them gives 144, which is too large, so let's try addition: 12 + 12 = 24.\n- Now, we have used both 12s, and we have 3 and 8 left.\n- We need to incorporate 3 and 8 into the equation without changing the result of 24.\n- Consider using subtraction or division to adjust the result:\n  - If we divide 24 by 8, we get 3, which is one of our numbers. This suggests a possible operation: (12 + 12) / 8 = 3.\n  - Now, we have used 12, 12, and 8, and we are left with 3.\n  - We can multiply the result by 3 to get back to 24: 3 * 8 = 24.\n\nThus, the equation that uses each number once and results in 24 is:\n\n((12 + 12) / 8) * 3 = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((12 + 12) / 8) * 3>>>"
