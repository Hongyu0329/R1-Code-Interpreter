    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 8, and 9 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 5, 8, 9.\n2. We need to use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/) to reach 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value.\n- Try multiplying the larger numbers first: 8 * 3 = 24. We don't have a 3, but we can try to create it.\n- Consider using 9 and 1 to create 3: (9 - 6) = 3. We don't have a 6, but we can try to create it.\n- Consider using 5 and 1 to create 6: (5 + 1) = 6.\n- Now, we can use the numbers as follows: (9 - (5 + 1)) = 3.\n- Multiply the result by 8: 8 * 3 = 24.\n\nThus, the equation that uses each number exactly once and results in 24 is:\n\n(8 * (9 - (5 + 1))) = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(8 * (9 - (5 + 1)))>>>"
