    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 3, 9, and 9 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 3, 9, and 9.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try different approaches:\n\n- **Approach 1**: Start with multiplication and addition.\n  - Multiply two numbers and see if the result can be adjusted to 24 using the other numbers.\n  - For example, 3 * 9 = 27. We need to adjust this to 24.\n  - 27 - 3 = 24. This uses three numbers, but we still have one more 9 to use.\n\n- **Approach 2**: Use division to simplify.\n  - Consider dividing one of the 9s by 3 to get 3.\n  - 9 / 3 = 3. Now we have 3, 3, and 3 left.\n  - 3 * 3 = 9. We have another 9 left.\n  - 9 + 9 = 18. This doesn't work.\n\n- **Approach 3**: Use subtraction and addition.\n  - Consider using subtraction to adjust the total.\n  - 9 + 9 = 18. We need to add 6 to get 24.\n  - 3 + 3 = 6. This works perfectly.\n\nThus, the correct combination is:\n- Add the two 9s: 9 + 9 = 18.\n- Add the two 3s: 3 + 3 = 6.\n- Add the results: 18 + 6 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(9 + 9) + (3 + 3)>>>"
