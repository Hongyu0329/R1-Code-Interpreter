    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 8, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 2s, which can be used to either add, subtract, multiply, or divide.\n2. The number 8 can be used in combination with other numbers to reach closer to 24.\n3. The number 12 is relatively large and can be used to either add to or subtract from other numbers to reach 24.\n\nNow, let's try to combine these numbers step by step:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 12. We can try to add or subtract from it to reach 24.\n- If we add 12 to another number, we need the result to be 12 (since 12 + 12 = 24).\n- We can use the two 2s to create a 4 (2 + 2 = 4).\n- Now, we have 12 and 4, which can be added to reach 16.\n- We still have the number 8 left, and 16 + 8 = 24.\n\nThus, the equation that uses all numbers exactly once and results in 24 is:\n\n(12 + (2 + 2) + 8) = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(12 + (2 + 2) + 8)>>>"
