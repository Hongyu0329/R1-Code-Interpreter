    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 11, 13, 13, and 13.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try different approaches:\n\n- **Approach 1**: Start with addition and multiplication.\n  - Try adding two numbers and then multiplying: (11 + 13) * 13 = 24. This doesn't work as (11 + 13) = 24, and 24 * 13 is too large.\n  \n- **Approach 2**: Use subtraction and addition.\n  - Try subtracting and then adding: 13 - 11 + 13 + 13 = 24. This doesn't work as 13 - 11 = 2, and 2 + 13 + 13 = 28.\n  \n- **Approach 3**: Use division and multiplication.\n  - Try dividing and then multiplying: (13 / 13) * 11 + 13 = 24. This doesn't work as (13 / 13) = 1, and 1 * 11 + 13 = 24.\n\n- **Approach 4**: Use a combination of operations.\n  - Try: (13 - (13 / 13)) * 11 = 24. This works because:\n    - 13 / 13 = 1\n    - 13 - 1 = 12\n    - 12 * 11 = 132, which is incorrect.\n\n- **Approach 5**: Re-evaluate and try another combination.\n  - Try: (11 + 13) - (13 - 13) = 24. This works because:\n    - 13 - 13 = 0\n    - 11 + 13 = 24\n    - 24 - 0 = 24\n\nAfter evaluating different combinations, the correct solution is:\n\n<<<(11 + 13) - (13 - 13)>>>"
