    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 11 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the target**: We need to reach the number 24.\n\n2. **Consider the numbers available**: We have three 2s and one 11.\n\n3. **Explore possible operations**:\n   - Addition: 2 + 2 + 2 + 11 = 17 (not 24)\n   - Multiplication: 2 * 2 * 2 * 11 = 88 (too high)\n   - Subtraction and division can be used to adjust the results.\n\n4. **Try combinations**:\n   - We can try to use multiplication to get closer to 24, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - Consider using 11 as a base and adjust with the 2s.\n\n5. **Experiment with operations**:\n   - If we multiply two 2s: 2 * 2 = 4\n   - Then multiply the result by the third 2: 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Now, add 11 to 8: 8 + 11 = 19 (still not 24)\n\n6. **Re-evaluate and try different combinations**:\n   - Consider using division to adjust the numbers.\n   - Try using 11 as a base and adjust with the 2s.\n\n7. **Successful combination**:\n   - Use division to simplify: 2 / 2 = 1\n   - Add the result to 11: 11 + 1 = 12\n   - Multiply by the remaining 2: 12 * 2 = 24\n\nThis combination uses all numbers exactly once and achieves the target of 24.\n\nFinal answer: <<<((2 / 2) + 11) * 2>>>"
