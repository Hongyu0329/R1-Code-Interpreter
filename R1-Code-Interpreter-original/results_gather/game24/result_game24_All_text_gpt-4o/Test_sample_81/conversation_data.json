    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 8, and 9 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 8, 8, and 9.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of these numbers with the operations to see which one results in 24.\n\n4. **Try different approaches**:\n   - Start by considering the largest number, 9, and see how it can be combined with others.\n   - Consider using multiplication first, as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Use addition and subtraction to adjust the total to 24.\n\n5. **Test combinations**:\n   - One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition:\n     - Try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n     - For example, multiply 3 and 8, then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\n6. **Calculate step by step**:\n   - Let's try: (3 * 8) = 24\n   - We have used 3 and 8, and we have another 8 and 9 left.\n   - We need to adjust the result to 24 using the remaining numbers.\n   - Since (3 * 8) already gives us 24, we need to ensure the remaining numbers do not alter the result.\n   - Consider using subtraction or division to neutralize the effect of the remaining numbers.\n\n7. **Final calculation**:\n   - Use the remaining numbers in a way that does not change the result:\n   - (3 * 8) = 24\n   - Use the remaining 8 and 9 in a way that results in zero or does not affect the total:\n   - (3 * 8) + (8 - 8) = 24\n   - This works because (8 - 8) = 0, so it does not change the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(3 * 8) + (8 - 8)>>>"
