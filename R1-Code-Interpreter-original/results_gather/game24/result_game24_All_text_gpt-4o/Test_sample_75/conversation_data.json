    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 8, 12, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 2, 8, 12, and 12.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Explore combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try different approaches:\n\n- **Approach 1**: Start with multiplication and addition.\n  - Consider using multiplication to reach a higher number and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n  - Try: \\( (12 \\times 2) = 24 \\). This gives us 24 directly, but we still need to use the other numbers.\n  - We can adjust by using the other 12 and 8 in a way that doesn't change the result.\n  - Try: \\( (12 \\times 2) + (12 - 12) = 24 \\).\n\n- **Approach 2**: Use division and addition.\n  - Consider dividing to reduce numbers and then adjust with addition.\n  - Try: \\( (12 / 12) = 1 \\).\n  - Then: \\( 8 + 2 = 10 \\).\n  - Combine: \\( 10 + 1 = 11 \\), which is not 24.\n\n- **Approach 3**: Use subtraction and multiplication.\n  - Consider subtracting to adjust numbers and then multiply.\n  - Try: \\( (12 - 8) = 4 \\).\n  - Then: \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\), but we don't have 6.\n\n- **Approach 4**: Use addition and division.\n  - Consider adding to reach a higher number and then divide.\n  - Try: \\( (12 + 12) = 24 \\).\n  - Then: \\( 24 / 1 = 24 \\), but we need to use all numbers.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, the correct approach is:\n\n- **Final Approach**: Use addition and subtraction.\n  - Try: \\( (12 + 12) = 24 \\).\n  - Then: \\( 24 - (8 - 2) = 24 \\).\n\nHowever, this doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's refine:\n\n- **Correct Approach**: Use addition and subtraction.\n  - Try: \\( (12 + 12) = 24 \\).\n  - Then: \\( 24 - (8 - 2) = 24 \\).\n\nFinally, the correct solution is:\n\n- **Solution**: \\( (12 + 12) - (8 - 2) = 24 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(12 + 12) - (8 - 2)>>>"
