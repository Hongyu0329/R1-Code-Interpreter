    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 12 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 12.\n2. We need to use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/) to reach 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n- Notice that 12 is a large number compared to the others, so it might be useful in multiplication or division.\n- Consider using multiplication to reach a higher number, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. Multiply 12 by 2: 12 * 2 = 24. This already gives us 24, but we need to use all numbers.\n2. Consider using 3 and 1 in a way that doesn't affect the result of 24.\n\nTry this approach:\n\n- Use 12 and 2 to get 24: 12 * 2 = 24.\n- Now, we need to incorporate 3 and 1 without changing the result.\n- We can use 3 and 1 in a way that results in 1, which doesn't affect the multiplication: (3 - 1) = 2.\n\nNow, combine these steps:\n\n- Calculate (3 - 1) = 2.\n- Multiply the result by 12: 12 * 2 = 24.\n\nThis uses all numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nFinal answer: <<<((3 - 1) * 12)>>>."
