    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 6, 11, and 11 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 3, 6, 11, and 11.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. **Use each number once**: We must ensure that each number is used exactly once in the equation.\n4. **Target result**: The final result should be 24.\n\nNow, let's try to construct an equation:\n\n- We have two 11s, which can be used to simplify the problem. If we add them, we get 22.\n- We can then add 3 to 22, which gives us 25.\n- Finally, subtract 6 from 25 to get 19, which is not 24. So, this approach doesn't work.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using multiplication to reach a higher number quickly.\n- If we multiply 6 by 3, we get 18.\n- Adding 11 to 18 gives us 29, which is too high.\n- Instead, let's try using subtraction: 11 - 3 = 8.\n- Now, multiply 8 by 3 to get 24.\n\nThis approach works:\n\n- Start with 11 - 3 = 8.\n- Multiply 8 by 3 to get 24.\n\nThus, the equation that satisfies the conditions is:\n\n<<<(11 - 3) * 3 = 24>>>"
