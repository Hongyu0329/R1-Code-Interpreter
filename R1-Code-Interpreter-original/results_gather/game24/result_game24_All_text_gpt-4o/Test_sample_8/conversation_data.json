    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 11, and 12 to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers and possible operations:\n\n1. We have two 1s, which can be used to either add, subtract, multiply, or divide without changing the value significantly.\n2. The numbers 11 and 12 are larger and can be used to reach closer to 24.\n\nLet's try different combinations and operations:\n\n- Start by adding 11 and 12:  \n  \\(11 + 12 = 23\\)\n\n- We need to reach 24, so we need to add 1 more to 23. We have two 1s available.\n\n- Add one of the 1s to 23:  \n  \\(23 + 1 = 24\\)\n\n- The remaining 1 can be used in a way that doesn't change the result, such as multiplying by 1:  \n  \\((23 + 1) \\times 1 = 24\\)\n\nThus, the equation that uses all numbers exactly once and results in 24 is:\n\n\\((11 + 12 + 1) \\times 1 = 24\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(11 + 12 + 1) * 1>>>"
