    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 13, and 13 to obtain the result of 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 4, 6, 13, and 13.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Since we have two 13s, we can consider using them in a way that simplifies the equation, such as subtraction or division.\n   - We can try to form intermediate results that are easy to manipulate to reach 24.\n\n4. **Try different operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly change the magnitude of numbers.\n   - Consider using addition and subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 24.\n\n5. **Test potential solutions**:\n   - One approach is to use the two 13s in a way that simplifies the equation. For example, dividing or subtracting them.\n   - We can try to form a product or sum that is close to 24 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\n6. **Find a valid equation**:\n   - Let's try using multiplication and addition:\n     - Consider using 13 and 13 to form a base number: \\(13 - 13 = 0\\).\n     - This doesn't help directly, so let's try another approach.\n     - Consider using multiplication: \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\).\n     - Adjust with subtraction: \\(26 - 6 = 20\\).\n     - This is not 24, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try using addition and multiplication:\n     - \\(13 + 13 = 26\\).\n     - Adjust with subtraction: \\(26 - 6 = 20\\).\n     - Again, this is not 24, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try using division:\n     - \\(13 / 13 = 1\\).\n     - Use multiplication: \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\).\n     - Adjust with addition: \\(6 + 4 = 10\\).\n     - This is not 24, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try using a different combination:\n     - \\(13 + 13 = 26\\).\n     - Subtract 4: \\(26 - 4 = 22\\).\n     - Add 6: \\(22 + 6 = 28\\).\n     - This is not 24, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try using a different combination:\n     - \\(13 + 13 = 26\\).\n     - Subtract 6: \\(26 - 6 = 20\\).\n     - Add 4: \\(20 + 4 = 24\\).\n\n7. **Verify the solution**:\n   - The equation \\( (13 + 13) - 6 + 4 = 24 \\) uses all numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<(13 + 13) - 6 + 4 = 24>>>"
