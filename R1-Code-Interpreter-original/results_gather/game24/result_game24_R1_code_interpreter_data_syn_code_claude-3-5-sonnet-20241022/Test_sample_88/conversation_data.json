    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have numbers: 1, 5, 6, 9\n   - We need to use each number exactly once\n   - We can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)\n   - The result should be 24\n\n2) This is a combinatorial problem. Let's write a Python program to:\n   - Generate all possible permutations of numbers\n   - Generate all possible combinations of operators\n   - Try all possible ways to group operations (using parentheses)\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\nimport operator\n\ndef evaluate(nums, ops, paren):\n    if paren == 0:  # ((a#b)#c)#d\n        try:\n            val1 = ops[0](nums[0], nums[1])\n            val2 = ops[1](val1, nums[2])\n            return ops[2](val2, nums[3])\n        except:\n            return None\n    elif paren == 1:  # (a#b)#(c#d)\n        try:\n            val1 = ops[0](nums[0], nums[1])\n            val2 = ops[2](nums[2], nums[3])\n            return ops[1](val1, val2)\n        except:\n            return None\n    elif paren == 2:  # (a#(b#c))#d\n        try:\n            val1 = ops[1](nums[1], nums[2])\n            val2 = ops[0](nums[0], val1)\n            return ops[2](val2, nums[3])\n        except:\n            return None\n\ndef find_24(numbers):\n    operators = {\n        '+': operator.add,\n        '-': operator.sub,\n        '*': operator.mul,\n        '/': operator.truediv\n    }\n    \n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product([operators[op] for op in '+-*/'], repeat=3):\n            for paren in range(3):\n                result = evaluate(nums, ops, paren)\n                if result is not None and abs(result - 24) < 1e-10:\n                    # Convert operators back to symbols\n                    op_symbols = []\n                    for op in ops:\n                        if op == operator.add: op_symbols.append('+')\n                        elif op == operator.sub: op_symbols.append('-')\n                        elif op == operator.mul: op_symbols.append('*')\n                        else: op_symbols.append('/')\n                    \n                    if paren == 0:\n                        return f\"(({nums[0]}{op_symbols[0]}{nums[1]}){op_symbols[1]}{nums[2]}){op_symbols[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n                    elif paren == 1:\n                        return f\"({nums[0]}{op_symbols[0]}{nums[1]}){op_symbols[1]}({nums[2]}{op_symbols[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n                    else:\n                        return f\"({nums[0]}{op_symbols[0]}({nums[1]}{op_symbols[1]}{nums[2]})){op_symbols[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n\nresult = find_24([1, 5, 6, 9])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe program has found a solution.

    "I see that the code found a different (and actually better) solution than what I initially provided.
