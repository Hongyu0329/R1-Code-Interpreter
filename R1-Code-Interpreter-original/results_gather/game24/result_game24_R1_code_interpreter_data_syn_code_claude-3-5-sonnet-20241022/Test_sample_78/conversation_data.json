    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We need to use numbers 3, 6, 6, 12\n   - Each number must be used exactly once\n   - We can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)\n   - The result must be 24\n\n2) Since we have two 6's, we need to be careful about distinguishing them.\n\n3) Let's write a Python program to systematically check all possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport operator\n\ndef evaluate(nums, ops, parens):\n    # Convert string representation to actual operators\n    op_dict = {'+': operator.add, '-': operator.sub, '*': operator.mul, '/': operator.truediv}\n    \n    try:\n        if parens == 0:  # ((a#b)#c)#d\n            result = op_dict[ops[0]](nums[0], nums[1])\n            result = op_dict[ops[1]](result, nums[2])\n            result = op_dict[ops[2]](result, nums[3])\n        elif parens == 1:  # (a#b)#(c#d)\n            result1 = op_dict[ops[0]](nums[0], nums[1])\n            result2 = op_dict[ops[2]](nums[2], nums[3])\n            result = op_dict[ops[1]](result1, result2)\n        elif parens == 2:  # (a#(b#c))#d\n            result = op_dict[ops[1]](nums[1], nums[2])\n            result = op_dict[ops[0]](nums[0], result)\n            result = op_dict[ops[2]](result, nums[3])\n        \n        return abs(result - 24) < 1e-10\n    except:\n        return False\n\ndef find_24(numbers):\n    operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    \n    # Try all number permutations\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Try all operator combinations\n        for op1 in operators:\n            for op2 in operators:\n                for op3 in operators:\n                    ops = [op1, op2, op3]\n                    # Try different parentheses arrangements\n                    for parens in range(3):\n                        if evaluate(nums, ops, parens):\n                            if parens == 0:\n                                return f\"(({nums[0]}{op1}{nums[1]}){op2}{nums[2]}){op3}{nums[3]}\"\n                            elif parens == 1:\n                                return f\"({nums[0]}{op1}{nums[1]}){op2}({nums[2]}{op3}{nums[3]})\"\n                            else:\n                                return f\"({nums[0]}{op1}({nums[1]}{op2}{nums[2]})){op3}{nums[3]}\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nprint(find_24([3, 6, 6, 12]))\n```\n\nThe program found a solution.

    "Ah, I see the code found a different valid solution. Let me verify this solution:\n\n(3-(6/6))*12\n= (3-1)*12\n= 2*12\n= 24\n\nThis is indeed a valid solution and it's actually simpler than the one I initially thought of. Let's confirm this is our final answer.\n\n<<<(3-(6/6))*12>>>"
