    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 6 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Consider different combinations of operations and groupings to see how we can reach 24.\n2. Try to use multiplication and addition as they are more likely to increase the result to 24.\n3. Check if any combination of operations and numbers can yield 24.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 4 to get 24.\n- Add 3 and 2 to get 5.\n- Subtract 5 from 24 to get 19, which is not correct.\n- Instead, try another combination.\n\nFinally, the correct combination is:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 4 to get 24.\n- Add 3 and 2 to get 5.\n- Subtract 5 from 24 to get 19, which is not correct.\n- Instead, try another combination.\n\nFinally, the correct combination is:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 4 to get 24.\n- Add 3 and 2 to get 5.\n- Subtract 5 from 24 to

    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations. We'll use backtracking to try different permutations of the numbers and operations, ensuring that we consider all potential solutions. We'll also handle the order of operations correctly by using parentheses where necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Use a recursive function to evaluate expressions with different groupings using parentheses.\n4. Check if any of these expressions evaluate to 24.\n5. Return the first valid expression found.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operators, repeat=3):\n            # Generate all possible expressions with parentheses\n            expressions = [\n                f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}{num_perm[2]}){ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}\",\n                f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}({num_perm[1]}{ops[1]}{num_perm[2]})){ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}\",\n                f\"{num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}(({num_perm[1]}{ops[1]}{num_perm[2]}){ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\",\n                f\"{num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}({num_perm[1]}{ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\",\n                f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            ]\n            for expr in expressions:\n                if evaluate_expression(expr) == 24:\n                    return expr\n    return None\n\nnumbers = [2, 3, 4, 6]\nsolution = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, checking each possible expression to see if it evaluates to 24.
