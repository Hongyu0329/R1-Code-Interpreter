    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 10, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 5, 5, 10, and 13.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Subtract 5 from 13 to get 8.\n- Add the result to 10 to get 18.\n- Add the remaining 5 to get 23.\n- Add 1 to 23 to get 24.\n\nHowever, we need to use all numbers exactly once, so let's adjust the operations:\n\n- Subtract 5 from 13 to get 8.\n- Add 10 to 8 to get 18.\n- Add the remaining 5 to 18 to get 23.\n- Add 1 to 23 to get 24.\n\nThis doesn't work as expected, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 5 from 13 to get 8.\n- Multiply 8 by 3 (using 5 and 10) to get 24.\n\nLet's write the final equation:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 5, 5, 10, and 13\nresult = (13 - 5) * (10 // 5)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the result of the equation using the given numbers and operations.",
    "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations. We'll use backtracking to try different permutations of the numbers and apply different operations to see if we can achieve the target result of 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible ways to insert the operations (+, -, *, /) between the numbers.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the current permutation of numbers and operations\n    expression = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n    try:\n        if eval(expression) == 24:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return None\n\nnumbers = [5, 5, 10, 13]\nexpression = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\n\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. If such an expression is found, it will be printed in the required format."

    "The current approach is not yielding the correct result. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This will help ensure that all possibilities are considered, and the correct equation is found. Aim to generate code that can handle symbolic computing and efficient searching to solve the problem."
