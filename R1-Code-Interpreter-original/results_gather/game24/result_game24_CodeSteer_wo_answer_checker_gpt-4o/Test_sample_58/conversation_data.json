    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 13, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 13s, which can be useful for operations like subtraction or division.\n2. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n3. Consider using multiplication and addition to reach a number close to 24, then adjust with subtraction or division.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Use one of the 13s and 3 to form a product: \\(13 \\times 3 = 39\\).\n- Subtract 7 from 39: \\(39 - 7 = 32\\).\n- Subtract the remaining 13 from 32: \\(32 - 13 = 19\\).\n- This approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find:\n\n- Use one of the 13s and 7 to form a product: \\(13 \\times 7 = 91\\).\n- Subtract 3 from 91: \\(91 - 3 = 88\\).\n- Divide 88 by the remaining 13: \\(88 / 13 \\approx 6.77\\).\n- This approach doesn't work either, so let's try another combination.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n- Use one of the 13s and 3 to form a sum: \\(13 + 3 = 16\\).\n- Multiply 16 by 7: \\(16 \\times 7 = 112\\).\n- Divide 112 by the remaining 13: \\(112 / 13 \\approx 8.615\\).\n- This approach doesn't work either, so let's try another combination.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n- Use one of the 13s and 7 to form a sum: \\(13 + 7 = 20\\).\n- Add 3 to 20: \\(20 + 3 = 23\\).\n- Add the remaining 13 to 23: \\(23 + 13 = 36\\).\n- This approach doesn't work either, so let's try another combination.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n- Use one of the 13s and 3 to form a sum: \\(13 + 3 = 16\\).\n- Add 7 to 16: \\(16 + 7 = 23\\).\n- Add the

    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a brute-force approach to test all possible permutations of the numbers and all possible combinations of arithmetic operations. This approach will ensure that we find a valid solution if one exists.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers. Since we have four numbers, there are \\(4! = 24\\) permutations.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of arithmetic operations. There are three operations to place between four numbers, and each operation can be one of the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). This results in \\(4^3 = 64\\) combinations of operations.\n3. Evaluate each expression formed by a permutation of numbers and a combination of operations.\n4. Check if the result of the expression is 24. If it is, print the expression.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression with the given numbers and operations\n    try:\n        result = eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\")\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression_for_24(numbers):\n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result == 24:\n                # Format the expression for output\n                expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n                return f\"<<<{expression}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Test the function with the given input\nnumbers = [3, 7, 13, 13]\nprint(find_expression_for_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will systematically test all possible combinations of the numbers and operations to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24. If a solution is found, it will be printed in the specified format."

    "The current approach of trying different combinations manually is not effective. To solve this problem, consider implementing a more systematic approach using code. You can use a backtracking algorithm or a brute-force search to explore all possible combinations of the numbers and operations. This will ensure that you find a valid solution if one exists. Try to generate code that systematically tests all permutations of the numbers with all possible operations to find a combination that results in 24."
