    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 2, and 13.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 as follows: \\((13 - 1) \\times (2 + 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(13 - 1 = 12\\)\n- \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n- \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\)\n\nHowever, this does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 as follows: \\((13 + 1) \\times (2 - 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(13 + 1 = 14\\)\n- \\(2 - 1 = 1\\)\n- \\(14 \\times 1 = 14\\)\n\nThis also does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 as follows: \\((13 \\times 2) - (1 + 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\)\n- \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(26 - 2 = 24\\)\n\nThis gives us the correct result of 24. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13\nresult = (13 * 2) - (1 + 1)\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(\"<<<((13 * 2) - (1 + 1))>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more robust solution that can handle a variety of inputs and find an equation that results in 24, we can use a combination of permutations and symbolic computation. The plan is as follows:\n\n1. **Generate Permutations**: Create all possible permutations of the input numbers. This will allow us to try different orders of the numbers.\n\n2. **Generate Combinations of Operations**: For each permutation of numbers, generate all possible combinations of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n\n3. **Evaluate Expressions**: For each combination of numbers and operations, evaluate the expression to see if it results in 24.\n\n4. **Use Parentheses**: Consider different ways to parenthesize the expressions to respect the order of operations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once a valid expression is found, output it in the specified format.\n\nHere's a Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport operator\n\n# Define the operations\nops = {\n    '+': operator.add,\n    '-': operator.sub,\n    '*': operator.mul,\n    '/': operator.truediv\n}\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression with given numbers and operations\ndef evaluate_expression(numbers, operations):\n    try:\n        # Try different parenthesizations\n        for a, b, c in itertools.permutations(range(3), 3):\n            # ((a op b) op c)\n            if ops[operations[0]](ops[operations[1]](numbers[a], numbers[b]), numbers[c]) == 24:\n                return f\"(({numbers[a]} {operations[1]} {numbers[b]}) {operations[0]} {numbers[c]})\"\n            # (a op (b op c))\n            if ops[operations[0]](numbers[a], ops[operations[1]](numbers[b], numbers[c])) == 24:\n                return f\"({numbers[a]} {operations[0]} ({numbers[b]} {operations[1]} {numbers[c]}))\"\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\n# Main function to find the expression\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # Generate all permutations of numbers\n    for num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops_comb in itertools.product(ops.keys(), repeat=2):\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops_comb)\n            if result:\n                return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Example input\nnumbers = [1, 1, 2, 13]\n\n# Find and print the expression\nprint(find_expression_to_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid expression that results in 24 using the given numbers and operations. It uses permutations to try different orders of numbers and operations, and it evaluates each possible expression. If a valid expression is found, it outputs it in the specified format."

    "The current solution uses direct numerical operations, which is sufficient for this specific problem. However, to enhance the code's capability for similar tasks with different inputs, consider implementing a more complex solution that involves symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms. This could involve generating permutations of the numbers and operations, and evaluating each combination to find the correct equation that results in 24. This approach will make the solution more robust and adaptable to a wider range of inputs."
