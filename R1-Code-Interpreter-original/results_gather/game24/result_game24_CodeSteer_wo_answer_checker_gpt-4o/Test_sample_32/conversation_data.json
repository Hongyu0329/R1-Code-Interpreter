    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 11, and 11 to form an equation that results in 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 11s, which can be added together to make 22.\n2. We can add 2 to 22 to get 24.\n3. The number 1 can be used in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as multiplying by 1.\n\nSo, the equation can be structured as follows: (1 * (11 + 11 + 2)) = 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = 11\nd = 11\n\n# Calculate the result using the numbers and operations\nresult = (a * (c + d + b))\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more sophisticated approach, we can implement a recursive function that explores all possible combinations and permutations of the numbers and operations. This approach will ensure that we consider all potential solutions.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers. Since we have four numbers, there are 4! (24) permutations.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible ways to insert the operations (+, -, *, /) between the numbers. There are 4 operations and 3 slots between numbers, resulting in 4^3 (64) combinations for each permutation.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, format it and print it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Construct the expression as a string\n    expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n    try:\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        if eval(expr) == 24:\n            return expr\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if expr:\n                return expr\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 11, 11]\n\n# Find and print the expression that evaluates to 24\nsolution = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically tries all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, evaluating each expression to see if it equals 24. If a valid expression is found, it is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution is correct in terms of the arithmetic operations, but the code lacks complexity and symbolic computing. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that explores different combinations and permutations of the numbers and operations to ensure all possible solutions are considered. This could involve using a recursive function or a backtracking algorithm to systematically try different combinations until the correct one is found. Aim to generate code that not only solves the problem but also demonstrates a deeper understanding of symbolic computation and efficient searching."
