    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 11, and 12.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 11, and 12 as follows: \\((12 - 11) \\times (1 + 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\).\n\nThis doesn't give us 24, so let's try another approach.\n\nAfter further testing, we find that:\n\n- \\((12 + 11) + (1 \\times 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(23 + 1 = 24\\).\n\nThis gives us the desired result of 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 1, 1, 11, and 12\nresult = (12 + 11) + (1 * 1)\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(\"<<<((12 + 11) + (1 * 1))>>>\")\n```",
