    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 7, 10, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- ((12 - 10) * (7 + 5)) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this result.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 5, 7, 10, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations and groupings\nresult = ((d - c) * (b + a))\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<(({}-{})*({}+{}))>>>\".format(d, c, b, a))\n```",
    "To enhance the solution's complexity and efficiency, we can implement a recursive function that explores all possible permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations. This approach will systematically try different groupings and operations to find a valid equation that results in 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the input numbers since the order of numbers can affect the result.\n2. Use a recursive function to try all possible combinations of operations and groupings.\n3. Check if any combination results in 24.\n4. If a valid combination is found, format and print the equation.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport operator\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [5, 7, 10, 12]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.truediv]\noperation_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the expression with given numbers and operations.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Apply operations in the order of precedence\n        result = ops[0](nums[0], nums[1])\n        result = ops[1](result, nums[2])\n        result = ops[2](result, nums[3])\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression():\n    \"\"\"Find a valid expression that evaluates to the target.\"\"\"\n    for num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n                # Format the expression with the correct symbols\n                expr = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{operation_symbols[operations.index(ops[0])]}{num_perm[1]})\" \\\n                       f\"{operation_symbols[operations.index(ops[1])]}{num_perm[2]})\" \\\n                       f\"{operation_symbols[operations.index(ops[2])]}{num_perm[3]}\"\n                return expr\n    return None\n\n# Find and print the expression\nexpression = find_expression()\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No valid expression found.\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically tries all permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24. If such an expression is found, it is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution is correct and outputs the desired result. However, to enhance the code's complexity and efficiency, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that explores all possible combinations of operations and groupings. This could involve using a recursive function or a backtracking algorithm to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This approach will ensure that the solution is not only correct but also robust and adaptable to different sets of input numbers."
