    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 7, 7, and 7 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have three 7s and one 4. We can try to use multiplication and addition to reach 24.\n2. Notice that \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\). If we can make 3 using the remaining numbers, we can add it to 21 to get 24.\n3. We can use the remaining 7 and 4 to make 3 by doing \\(7 - 4 = 3\\).\n4. Now, we can add this result to 21 to get 24.\n\nThe equation becomes: \\((7 \\times 3) + (7 - 4) = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 4, 7, 7, 7\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = (b * (c - a)) + (d - a)\n\n# Print the formatted answer\nprint(f\"<<<({b} * ({c} - {a})) + ({d} - {a}) = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more dynamic solution that can handle a variety of inputs, we can implement a recursive function that tries different combinations of numbers and operations. This approach will systematically explore all possible ways to combine the numbers using the basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value of 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a recursive function to try all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the given numbers and operations\n    a, b, c, d = nums\n    op1, op2, op3 = ops\n    \n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    try:\n        if eval(f\"({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d})\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\"\n        if eval(f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\"\n        if eval(f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d}\") == 24:\n            return f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d}\"\n        if eval(f\"{a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d})\") == 24:\n            return f\"{a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d})\"\n        if eval(f\"{a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\") == 24:\n            return f\"{a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\"\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return f\"<<<{result} = 24>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [4, 7, 7, 7]\nprint(find_expression_to_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, checking each possible parenthesization to see if it evaluates to 24. If a valid expression is found, it will be printed in the required format."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code is not leveraging symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques. To improve the code, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that explores different combinations of operations and numbers to find the solution. This could involve using a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try different possibilities. Aim to generate code that can handle a variety of inputs and find solutions dynamically, rather than hardcoding the solution."
