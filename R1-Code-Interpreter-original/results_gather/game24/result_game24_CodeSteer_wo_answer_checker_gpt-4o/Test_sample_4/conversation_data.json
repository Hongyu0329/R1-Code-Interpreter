    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 2, and 11.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers in the order: 11, 2, 1, 1.\n- The operations are: multiplication, addition, and subtraction.\n\nThe equation is: \\((11 \\times 2) + (1 \\times 1)\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print this result.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 11\nb = 2\nc = 1\nd = 1\n\n# Calculate the result using the equation\nresult = (a * b) + (c * d)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic approach, we can implement a recursive function that explores all possible combinations of the numbers and operations.

For each permutation, try all possible ways to insert the operations (+, -, *, /) between the numbers.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the current permutation of numbers and operations\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product('+-*/', repeat=3):\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == 24:\n                # Format the expression as a string\n                expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n                return f\"<<<{expression}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [1, 1, 2, 11]\n\n# Find and print the expression that results in 24\nprint(find_expression_to_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24.
