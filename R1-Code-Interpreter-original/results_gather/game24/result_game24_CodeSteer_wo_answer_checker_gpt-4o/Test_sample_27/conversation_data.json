    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have three 13s and one 11. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to get 24.\n2. Since 13 is a large number, we might consider using subtraction to reduce the total.\n3. We can try to form a combination where we subtract one of the 13s from another number to reduce the total.\n4. We can also consider using division to reduce the impact of the larger numbers.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- If we subtract 11 from 13, we get 2.\n- We can then divide another 13 by this result (2) to get 6.5.\n- Finally, we can subtract this result from the remaining 13 to get 6.5, and then multiply by 2 to get 13, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 11 from 13 to get 2.\n- Divide another 13 by 13 to get 1.\n- Add these results to get 3.\n- Multiply by 8 to get 24.\n\nThis approach doesn't work either.

    "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to systematically explore all possible combinations of arithmetic operations and numbers.

    "Let's refine the code further to ensure it correctly handles all arithmetic operations and thoroughly explores all permutations and combinations. We'll add detailed logging to trace the steps and identify where the logic might be failing. This will help us understand the flow of the program and ensure that the symbolic expressions accurately represent the arithmetic operations performed.\n\nHere's the updated code with added logging and improved logic:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    def helper(nums, exprs):\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            if abs(nums[0] - 24) < 1e-6:  # Check if the result is 24\n                return exprs[0]\n            return None\n        \n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n                for op in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n                    if op == '/' and nums[j] == 0:\n                        continue  # Avoid division by zero\n                    \n                    new_nums = nums[:i] + nums[i+1:j] + nums[j+1:]\n                    new_exprs = exprs[:i] + exprs[i+1:j] + exprs[j+1:]\n                    \n                    if op == '+':\n                        new_num = nums[i] + nums[j]\n                        new_expr = f\"({exprs[i]}+{exprs[j]})\"\n                    elif op == '-':\n                        new_num = nums[i] - nums[j]\n                        new_expr = f\"({exprs[i]}-{exprs[j]})\"\n                    elif op == '*':\n                        new_num = nums[i] * nums[j]\n                        new_expr = f\"({exprs[i]}*{exprs[j]})\"\n                    elif op == '/':\n                        if nums[j] != 0:\n                            new_num = nums[i] / nums[j]\n                            new_expr = f\"({exprs[i]}/{exprs[j]})\"\n                        else:\n                            continue\n                    \n                    print(f\"Trying: {new_expr} = {new_num}\")\n                    result = helper(new_nums + [new_num], new_exprs + [new_expr])\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n        return None\n\n    for perm in permutations(numbers):\n        exprs = [str(num) for num in perm]\n        print(f\"Permutation: {perm}\")\n        result = helper(list(perm), exprs)\n        if result:\n            return result\n\nnumbers = [11, 13, 13, 13]\nexpression = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Logging**: Added print statements to log the current permutation being tried and each arithmetic operation being performed. This will help trace the steps and understand the flow of the program.\n- **Thorough Exploration**: The code explores all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, ensuring that no possibilities are missed.\n\nThis code will print out each step it takes, allowing you to see exactly how it is attempting to solve the problem. This should help identify any logical errors or missed cases."

    "The current approach is not yielding the correct solution. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more systematic and efficient search algorithm. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to explore all possible combinations of operations and numbers. Additionally, consider using symbolic computing to handle the arithmetic operations more effectively. This will help in finding the correct combination that results in 24. Try to generate code that systematically explores all possible arithmetic expressions using the given numbers.",
