    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 3, 7, 9, 9.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- If we add 9 and 9, we get 18.\n- If we add 3 to 18, we get 21.\n- If we add 7 to 21, we get 28.\n- If we subtract 4 from 28, we get 24.\n\nHowever, we need to use all numbers exactly once, and the above steps don't use all numbers correctly.

    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a recursive function to explore all possible permutations of the numbers and apply the four basic arithmetic operations. This approach will ensure that we explore all potential solutions. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2.
