    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 7, 7, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Start by considering the numbers 11 and 12, which are close to 24 when added together.\n- Add 11 and 12 to get 23.\n- We have two 7s left. We can use one of the 7s to add to 23 to get 30.\n- Then, subtract the other 7 from 30 to get 23.\n- Finally, add 1 to reach 24.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't work directly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using multiplication and division to adjust the values.\n- We can try multiplying 7 by 11 to get 77.\n- Then, divide 77 by 7 to get 11.\n- Add 12 to 11 to get 23.\n- Finally, add 1 to reach 24.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work directly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using multiplication and addition to adjust the values.\n- Multiply 7 by 7 to get 49.\n- Subtract 11 from 49 to get 38.\n- Subtract 12 from 38 to get 26.\n- Finally, subtract 2 to reach 24.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work directly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using multiplication and addition to adjust the values.\n- Multiply 7 by 7 to get 49.\n- Subtract 12 from 49 to get 37.\n- Subtract 11 from 37 to get 26.\n- Finally, subtract 2 to reach 24.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work directly.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Each number should be used only once but each number has to be used in the equation. Input: 9 10 11 13, Answer: ((10-9)*(11+13)) = 24 Input: 4 10 10 11, Answer: ((4*11)-(10+10)) = 24 Input: 5 6 13 13, Answer: ((5-(13/13))*6)Input: 2 6 6 7, Answer: ((6+(6*7))/2) Input: 2 6 10 18, Answer: (2-(6-(10+18)))Input: 7 7 11 12 Answer:\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
    "The current approach is not yielding the correct solution. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more systematic and efficient search algorithm, such as backtracking or using a recursive function, to explore all possible combinations of operations and groupings. This will help ensure that all potential solutions are considered. Additionally, consider using symbolic computing to handle the arithmetic operations more effectively.",
    "The current code attempts to solve the problem using a recursive approach, which is a good start. However, the solution is not correct as it outputs an incorrect result. To improve the solution, ensure that the recursive function correctly handles all possible combinations of operations and groupings. Additionally, verify that the base case correctly identifies when the result is exactly 24, and ensure that the recursive calls properly build and return the correct equation. Consider debugging the code to identify where the logic may be failing and adjust the approach to ensure all potential solutions are explored.",
