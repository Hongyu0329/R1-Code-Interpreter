    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 10, 10, and 10 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have three 10s and one 6. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to get 24.\n2. One approach is to consider using multiplication and addition, as these operations can help us reach larger numbers.\n3. We can start by considering the multiplication of two numbers and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n4. Let's try multiplying two 10s to get 100, then see how we can adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we find that:\n\n- Multiply two 10s: \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\)\n- Subtract 6: \\(100 - 6 = 94\\)\n- Subtract the remaining 10: \\(94 - 10 = 84\\)\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 6 by 10: \\(6 \\times 10 = 60\\)\n- Subtract 10: \\(60 - 10 = 50\\)\n- Subtract the remaining 10: \\(50 - 10 = 40\\)\n\nThis also doesn't work. Let's try a different approach:\n\n- Add two 10s: \\(10 + 10 = 20\\)\n- Add 6: \\(20 + 6 = 26\\)\n- Subtract the remaining 10: \\(26 - 10 = 16\\)\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 by 10: \\(6 \\times 10 = 60\\)\n- Divide by 10: \\(60 / 10 = 6\\)\n- Add the remaining 10: \\(6 + 10 = 16\\)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Add two 10s: \\(10 + 10 = 20\\)\n- Multiply by 6: \\(20 \\times 6 = 120\\)\n- Divide by the remaining 10: \\(120 / 10 = 12\\)\n\nThis doesn't work.

    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible combinations of operations and numbers.
