    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 6, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have two pairs of numbers: 6 and 12.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations to see if we can reach 24.\n3. One possible approach is to use multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n\nLet's try the following steps:\n\n- Multiply one pair of numbers: 6 * 12 = 72\n- Divide the result by the other pair of numbers: 72 / 6 = 12\n- Add the remaining number: 12 + 12 = 24\n\nThis approach uses all numbers and results in 24. Now, let's write the Python code to reflect this solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 6, 6, 12, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = ((a * c) / b) + d\n\n# Print the final equation and result\nprint(f\"<<<(({a}*{c})/{b})+{d}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more efficiently and handle a variety of inputs, we can implement a recursive function that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. This approach will involve:\n\n1. Generating all permutations of the input numbers to consider different orders.\n2. Trying all possible combinations of arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n3. Placing parentheses in different ways to change the order of operations.\n4. Using recursion to explore these possibilities and check if any combination results in 24.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the expression with given numbers and operations.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Try different parenthesis placements\n        expressions = [\n            f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n            f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n            f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n            f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n            f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        ]\n        for expr in expressions:\n            if eval(expr) == 24:\n                return expr\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_for_24(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Find an expression that evaluates to 24 using all numbers and basic operations.\"\"\"\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [6, 6, 12, 12]\nprint(find_expression_for_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `find_expression_for_24` that takes a list of four numbers and attempts to find an expression that evaluates to 24. It uses permutations to try different orders of numbers and combinations of operations, and it evaluates different parenthesis placements to find a valid solution. If a solution is found, it prints the expression in the required format."

    "The current solution uses a straightforward approach with basic arithmetic operations, but it lacks symbolic computing and efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that explores different combinations of operations and parentheses placements. This could involve using a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try all possible ways to combine the numbers and operations to reach the target value of 24. Aim to generate code that can handle a variety of inputs and find a solution if one exists."
