    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 13, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 13s, which can be combined in various ways. One straightforward way is to add them together: 13 + 13 = 26.\n2. We can then subtract 4 from 26 to get 22: 26 - 4 = 22.\n3. Finally, we can add 6 to 22 to get 28: 22 + 6 = 28.\n\nHowever, this doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. Start by multiplying 4 and 6: 4 * 6 = 24.\n2. We have two 13s left. We can use them in a way that doesn't affect the result of 24. For example, we can divide one 13 by the other: 13 / 13 = 1.\n3. Subtract this result from 24: 24 - 1 = 23.\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24. Let's try a different combination:\n\n1. Multiply 4 by 6: 4 * 6 = 24.\n2. We have two 13s left.

    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of the numbers and operations. This will help us find a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 4, 6, 13, and 13.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a recursive function to try all possible combinations of numbers and operations.\n2. At each step, choose two numbers and apply one of the four basic operations (+, -, *, /).\n3. Replace the two numbers with the result of the operation and continue the process with the remaining numbers.\n4. If at any point we have a single number left and it equals 24, we have found a solution.\n5. Ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the current permutation of numbers and operations\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0 or result % nums[i + 1] != 0:\n                return None\n            result //= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    # Try all permutations of numbers and operations\n    for num_perm in permutations(nums):\n        for ops in product('+-*/', repeat=3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == 24:\n                # Construct the expression string\n                expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n                return expression\n    return None\n\nnumbers = [4, 6, 13, 13]\nexpression = find_expression(numbers)\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24.

    "Let's refine the code to ensure that the expression is correctly formatted and that all operations are applied in the correct order. We'll also handle division carefully to avoid division by zero and ensure integer division where necessary. Additionally, we'll improve the expression construction to accurately reflect the operations performed.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef apply_operation(a, b, op):\n    if op == '+':\n        return a + b\n    elif op == '-':\n        return a - b\n    elif op == '*':\n        return a * b\n    elif op == '/':\n        if b == 0 or a % b != 0:\n            return None\n        return a // b\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Apply the operations in the order given by ops\n    result = apply_operation(nums[0], nums[1], ops[0])\n    if result is None:\n        return None\n    result = apply_operation(result, nums[2], ops[1])\n    if result is None:\n        return None\n    result = apply_operation(result, nums[3], ops[2])\n    return result\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    # Try all permutations of numbers and operations\n    for num_perm in permutations(nums):\n        for ops in product('+-*/', repeat=3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == 24:\n                # Construct the expression string\n                expression = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}{num_perm[2]}){ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}\"\n                return expression\n    return None\n\nnumbers = [4, 6, 13, 13]\nexpression = find_expression(numbers)\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n1. **Operation Application**: The `apply_operation` function handles each operation, ensuring that division is only performed when the divisor is non-zero and the result is an integer.\n2. **Expression Evaluation**: The `evaluate_expression` function applies operations in sequence, checking for valid results at each step.\n3. **Expression Construction**: The expression is constructed to reflect the order of operations, using parentheses to ensure clarity.\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 4, 6, 13, and 13, and print it in the required format.",
    "To enhance the search strategy, we can implement a more sophisticated backtracking approach that explores different groupings of operations and numbers.
