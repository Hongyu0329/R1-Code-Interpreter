    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 12.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 5, 5, and 12 to form a part of the equation: \\( (5 \\times 5) - 12 \\).\n- This results in \\( 25 - 12 = 13 \\).\n- Now, add the remaining number 3 to 13: \\( 13 + 3 = 16 \\).\n\nHowever, this doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 5, 5, and 3 to form a part of the equation: \\( (5 \\times 5) - 3 \\).\n- This results in \\( 25 - 3 = 22 \\).\n- Now, add the remaining number 12 to 22: \\( 22 + 12 = 34 \\).\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24.

    "To systematically find a solution, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations. We'll use a backtracking algorithm to generate and evaluate all possible expressions that use each number exactly once. This approach will ensure that we don't miss any potential solutions.\n\nHere's a plan for the solution:\n\n1. Define a recursive function that takes a list of numbers and a target value (24 in this case).\n2. If the list has only one number, check if it equals the target. If so, return the expression.\n3. Otherwise, iterate over all pairs of numbers in the list.\n4. For each pair, apply each of the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and recursively solve the problem with the new list of numbers (excluding the used pair and including the result of the operation).\n5. Use a symbolic computing library like SymPy to handle the arithmetic operations and expression evaluations.\n6. Return the first valid expression that evaluates to the target value.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef find_expression(numbers, target):\n    if len(numbers) == 1:\n        if simplify(numbers[0]) == target:\n            return str(numbers[0])\n        else:\n            return None\n\n    for i, j in permutations(range(len(numbers)), 2):\n        num1, num2 = numbers[i], numbers[j]\n        remaining = [numbers[k] for k in range(len(numbers)) if k != i and k != j]\n\n        for op in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n            if op == '/' and num2 == 0:\n                continue\n\n            expr = f\"({num1}{op}{num2})\"\n            new_numbers = [expr] + remaining\n            result = find_expression(new_numbers, target)\n\n            if result:\n                return result\n\n    return None\n\nnumbers = [3, 5, 5, 12]\ntarget = 24\nx = symbols('x')\nexpression = find_expression([str(x) for x in numbers], target)\n\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically explore all possible combinations of the numbers and operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24."

    "The current approach of trying different combinations manually is not yielding the correct result. To improve the solution, consider using a more systematic approach with code that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations.
