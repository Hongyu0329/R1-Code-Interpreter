    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of operations and groupings of the numbers. This approach will help us find a valid equation that results in 24. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. Define a recursive function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of all possible results that can be obtained using those numbers with basic arithmetic operations.\n2. For each pair of numbers, apply each arithmetic operation and recursively compute the results for the remaining numbers.\n3.
