    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have three 2s and one 11. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to reach 24.\n2. One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition, as these operations can increase the value quickly.\n3. We can start by multiplying two of the 2s to get 4.\n4. Then, we can multiply the result by the third 2 to get 8.\n5. Finally, we can add 11 to 8 and then add the remaining 2 to reach 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to represent this solution:\n\n```python\nresult = ((2 * 2) * 2) + 11 + 2\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the result using the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 11, and outputs the final answer in the required format.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to explore different combinations of the numbers and operations to find an expression that equals 24. We can use a recursive backtracking approach to systematically try different permutations of the numbers and operations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the given numbers and operations\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for num_perm in itertools.permutations(nums):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == 24:\n                # Format the expression\n                expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n                return f\"<<<{expression}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnums = [2, 2, 2, 11]\nprint(find_expression(nums))\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. If a valid expression is found, it will be printed in the required format."

    "The current approach is incorrect as it does not yield the desired result of 24. The code lacks symbolic computing and efficient searching to explore different combinations of operations and numbers. To improve, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically tries different permutations of the numbers and operations to find a valid expression that equals 24. You can use recursive backtracking or a similar method to explore all possible combinations. Ensure that each number is used exactly once in the expression."
