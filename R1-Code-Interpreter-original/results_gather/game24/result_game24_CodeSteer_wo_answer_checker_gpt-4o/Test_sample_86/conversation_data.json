    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 6 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 6.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- ((5 + 5) * (6 - 3)) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to compute this and print the result in the required format.\n\n```python\nresult = ((5 + 5) * (6 - 3))\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more systematically, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations and permutations of the numbers with the basic arithmetic operations. We will also consider all possible parenthesizations to account for different operation orders. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Permutations**: Generate all permutations of the input numbers. This will allow us to try different orders of the numbers.\n\n2. **Operations**: For each permutation, try all combinations of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n\n3. **Parenthesization**: Consider all possible ways to parenthesize the expression. This is crucial because the order of operations can affect the result.\n\n4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n\n5. **Output**: If a valid expression is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    try:\n        if eval(f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        if eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n        if eval(f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\") == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n        if eval(f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\") == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        if eval(f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\") == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            expression = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if expression:\n                return f\"<<<{expression}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [3, 5, 5, 6]\nprint(find_expression_to_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all possible combinations and parenthesizations to find an expression that evaluates to 24.

    "The current approach is not yielding the correct result. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that explores all possible combinations and permutations of the numbers with the basic arithmetic operations. This can be achieved by using a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try different combinations until the correct one is found. Additionally, ensure that the code checks for all possible parenthesizations to account for different operation orders. This will help in finding the correct expression that evaluates to 24."
