    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 5, 9, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 4, 5, 9, 9.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- If we multiply 5 by 4, we get 20.\n- Then, if we add 9 to 20, we get 29.\n- Finally, if we subtract the other 9 from 29, we get 20.\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 5 by 4, we get 20.\n- Then, if we add 9 to 20, we
