    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of operations and groupings. This will allow us to find a valid equation that results in 24 using the numbers 5, 6, 12, and 13. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that takes a list of numbers and tries all possible operations between them.\n2. **Base Case**: If the list has only one number, check if it equals 24.\n3. **Recursive Case**: For each pair of numbers, apply each arithmetic operation and recursively solve the problem with the new list of numbers.\n4. **Parentheses Handling**: Use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.\n5. **Output**: Once a valid equation is found, print it in the required format.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nfrom operator import add, sub, mul, truediv\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    ops = [add, sub, mul, truediv]\n    op_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n    def helper(nums):\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            if abs(nums[0] - 24) < 1e-6:  # Check if the result is 24\n                return str(nums[0])\n            return None\n\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(len(nums)):\n                if i != j:\n                    for op, symbol in zip(ops, op_symbols):\n                        try:\n                            new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j]\n                            new_nums.append(op(nums[i], nums[j]))\n                            expr = helper(new_nums)\n                            if expr:\n                                return f\"({nums[i]} {symbol} {nums[j]})\" + expr\n                        except ZeroDivisionError:\n                            continue\n        return None\n\n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        result = helper(list(perm))\n        if result:\n            return result\n\nnums = [5, 6, 12, 13]\nexpression = find_expression(nums)\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all possible operations between them to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24. The use of permutations ensures that all possible orderings of the numbers are considered, and the recursive function explores all combinations of operations.",
    "To address the issue and ensure the code correctly handles the order of operations and parentheses, we need to carefully construct and evaluate expressions. The recursive function should build expressions step-by-step, ensuring that each operation is applied correctly. Let's refine the approach:\n\n1. **Recursive Function**: The function should try all combinations of numbers and operations, ensuring that each number is used exactly once.\n2. **Expression Construction**: Build expressions as strings, ensuring that parentheses are used to maintain the correct order of operations.\n3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate each expression to check if it equals 24.\n4. **Debugging**: Add print statements to trace the construction and evaluation of expressions.\n\nHere's the refined Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nfrom operator import add, sub, mul, truediv\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    ops = [add, sub, mul, truediv]\n    op_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n    def helper(nums, exprs):\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            if abs(nums[0] - 24) < 1e-6:  # Check if the result is 24\n                return exprs[0]\n            return None\n\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(len(nums)):\n                if i != j:\n                    for op, symbol in zip(ops, op_symbols):\n                        try:\n                            new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j]\n                            new_exprs = [exprs[k] for k in range(len(exprs)) if k != i and k != j]\n                            new_nums.append(op(nums[i], nums[j]))\n                            new_exprs.append(f\"({exprs[i]} {symbol} {exprs[j]})\")\n                            result = helper(new_nums, new_exprs)\n                            if result:\n                                return result\n                        except ZeroDivisionError:\n                            continue\n        return None\n\n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        exprs = list(map(str, perm))\n        result = helper(list(perm), exprs)\n        if result:\n            return result\n\nnums = [5, 6, 12, 13]\nexpression = find_expression(nums)\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Expression Tracking**: The `helper` function now tracks both the numeric values and their corresponding string expressions.\n- **Expression Construction**: When combining two numbers, their corresponding expressions are also combined with the appropriate operator and parentheses.\n- **Evaluation**: The function checks if the final numeric result is close to 24, and if so, returns the corresponding expression.\n\nThis approach ensures that the order of operations is respected and that the final expression is correctly formatted and evaluated."
