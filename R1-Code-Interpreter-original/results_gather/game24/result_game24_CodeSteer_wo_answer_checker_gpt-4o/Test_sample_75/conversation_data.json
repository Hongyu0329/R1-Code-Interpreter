    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 8, 12, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 12s, which can be used to simplify the equation. For example, adding them together gives us 24, which is the target number.\n2. We can then use the remaining numbers, 2 and 8, to form an equation that results in 0, so that adding it to 24 does not change the result.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n- Use the two 12s to get 24: \\(12 + 12 = 24\\).\n- Use the 2 and 8 to form an equation that results in 0: \\(8 - 8 = 0\\).\n- Combine these results: \\(24 + 0 = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to represent this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (12 + 12) + (8 - 8)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((12+12)+(8-8))>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem in a more generalized manner, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. The goal is to find a valid equation that results in 24. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Permutations of Numbers**: Generate all permutations of the input numbers. This allows us to try different orders of the numbers.\n\n2. **Combinations of Operations**: For each permutation of numbers, try all possible combinations of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n\n3. **Recursive Evaluation**: Use a recursive function to evaluate all possible ways to combine the numbers and operations. This involves trying different groupings of numbers and operations.\n\n4. **Check for Validity**: For each combination, check if the result is 24. If it is, format the equation and return it.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: If a valid equation is found, print it in the required format.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try all possible ways to parenthesize the expression\n    a, b, c, d = nums\n    op1, op2, op3 = ops\n    \n    # Different ways to parenthesize\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\",\n        f\"(({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d})\",\n        f\"({a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d}))\",\n        f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\",\n        f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d})))\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        try:\n            if abs(eval(expr) - 24) < 1e-6:  # Check if the result is 24\n                return expr\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if expr:\n                return f\"<<<{expr}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [2, 8, 12, 12]\nprint(find_expression_to_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code systematically tries all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, evaluating each possible expression to see if it equals 24. If a valid expression is found, it is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution is too simplistic and does not fully utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching to explore all possible combinations of the numbers and operations. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically tries different combinations of the numbers and operations to find a valid equation that results in 24. This could involve using recursive functions or backtracking to explore all possible permutations and combinations. Aim to generate code that can handle a variety of inputs and find solutions in a more generalized manner."
