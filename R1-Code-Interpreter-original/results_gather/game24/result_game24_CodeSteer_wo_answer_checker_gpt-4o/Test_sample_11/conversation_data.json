    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 3, 8, 11, 11.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 11 and 11 to perform subtraction: \\(11 - 11 = 0\\).\n- Add 3 to the result: \\(0 + 3 = 3\\).\n- Multiply the result by 8: \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\).\n\nThis gives us the equation: \\((11 - 11 + 3) \\times 8 = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 3\nb = 8\nc = 11\nd = 11\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = (d - c + a) * b\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<(({} - {} + {}) * {})>>>\".format(d, c, a, b))\n```",
    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of the numbers and operations. The goal is to find a valid arithmetic expression that uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a recursive function to try all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Check if any combination results in 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, format it and print it.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the given numbers and operations\n    a, b, c, d = nums\n    op1, op2, op3 = ops\n    \n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    try:\n        if eval(f\"({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d})\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\"\n        if eval(f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\"\n        if eval(f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d}\") == 24:\n            return f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d}\"\n        if eval(f\"{a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d})\") == 24:\n            return f\"{a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d})\"\n        if eval(f\"{a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\") == 24:\n            return f\"{a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\"\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [3, 8, 11, 11]\nsolution = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically tries all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, checking each possible parenthesization to see if it results in 24. If a valid expression is found, it is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution does not correctly use all numbers in a way that adheres to the problem's constraints. The solution should involve using each number exactly once in a valid arithmetic expression that results in 24. Consider using a more systematic approach to explore all possible combinations and operations, such as implementing a recursive function or using a library for symbolic computation to ensure all possibilities are considered. This will help in finding a valid solution that meets the problem's requirements."
