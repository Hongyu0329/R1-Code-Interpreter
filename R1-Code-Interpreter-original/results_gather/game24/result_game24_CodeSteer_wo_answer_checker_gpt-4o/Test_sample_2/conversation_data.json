    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 2, and 8.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.\n- Add 1 to 16 to get 17.\n- Add the remaining 1 to 17 to get 18.\n- Finally, multiply 18 by 1 to get 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to represent this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 1, 2, 8\n\n# Calculate the result using the operations\nresult = (d * c) + a + b\n\n# Print the final equation and result\nprint(f\"<<<({d} * {c}) + {a} + {b} = {result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the equation and the result in the required format.",
    "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of operations and groupings of the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8. We'll use backtracking to try different operations and check if any combination results in 24. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a recursive function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of all possible results that can be obtained using those numbers with basic arithmetic operations.\n2. For each pair of numbers, apply each of the four basic operations (+, -, *, /) and recursively calculate the results for the remaining numbers.\n3. Check if any of the results equals 24.\n4. If a valid equation is found, format it and print it.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef calculate(a, b, op):\n    if op == '+':\n        return a + b\n    elif op == '-':\n        return a - b\n    elif op == '*':\n        return a * b\n    elif op == '/':\n        if b != 0:\n            return a / b\n    return None\n\ndef find_24(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) == 1:\n        if abs(numbers[0] - 24) < 1e-6:  # Check if the result is 24\n            return True, str(numbers[0])\n        return False, \"\"\n\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        for j in range(len(numbers)):\n            if i != j:\n                for op in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n                    # Create a new list without the i-th and j-th elements\n                    new_numbers = [numbers[k] for k in range(len(numbers)) if k != i and k != j]\n                    result = calculate(numbers[i], numbers[j], op)\n                    if result is not None:\n                        new_numbers.append(result)\n                        found, equation = find_24(new_numbers)\n                        if found:\n                            return True, f\"({numbers[i]} {op} {numbers[j]})\" + equation\n    return False, \"\"\n\n# Try all permutations of the numbers\nnumbers = [1, 1, 2, 8]\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    found, equation = find_24(list(perm))\n    if found:\n        print(f\"<<<{equation} = 24>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will explore all permutations of the numbers and all possible operations to find a valid equation that results in 24. It will print the first valid equation it finds."

    "The current solution does not achieve the desired result of 24. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex approach that involves symbolic computing and efficient searching. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to explore all possible combinations of operations and groupings of the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8. This will help ensure that all potential solutions are considered. Additionally, make sure to verify the correctness of the solution by checking if the final result equals 24. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code rather than simply displaying the answer."
