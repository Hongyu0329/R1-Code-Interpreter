    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 6, and 11 to form an equation that results in 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 6, 6, and 11.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that equals 24.\n\nLet's try different combinations and operations:\n\n- We can start by trying to use multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Consider using the two 6s together, as they might be useful in multiplication or addition.\n- We can also try to use subtraction to adjust the total to 24.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the two 6s to multiply: 6 * 6 = 36\n- Subtract 11 from 36: 36 - 11 = 25\n- Subtract 1 from 25: 25 - 1 = 24\n\nThis gives us the equation: ((6 * 6) - 11 - 1) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 6, 6, 11\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = (b * c) - d - a\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<(({b} * {c}) - {d} - {a}) = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To improve the solution, we can implement a more sophisticated approach using recursion and backtracking. This approach will systematically explore all possible permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations to find a valid solution that results in 24. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Permutations of Numbers**: Generate all possible permutations of the input numbers. This ensures that we consider every possible order of the numbers.\n\n2. **Combinations of Operations**: For each permutation of numbers, try all possible combinations of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n\n3. **Recursive Evaluation**: Use a recursive function to evaluate each combination of numbers and operations. The function will try different groupings of operations to find a valid equation.\n\n4. **Check for Valid Solution**: If a combination results in 24, print the equation in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different groupings of operations\n    try:\n        # ((a op1 b) op2 c) op3 d\n        result1 = ops[2](ops[1](ops[0](nums[0], nums[1]), nums[2]), nums[3])\n        if result1 == 24:\n            return f\"((({nums[0]} {ops[0].__name__} {nums[1]}) {ops[1].__name__} {nums[2]}) {ops[2].__name__} {nums[3]}) = 24\"\n        \n        # (a op1 (b op2 c)) op3 d\n        result2 = ops[2](ops[0](nums[0], ops[1](nums[1], nums[2])), nums[3])\n        if result2 == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0].__name__} ({nums[1]} {ops[1].__name__} {nums[2]})) {ops[2].__name__} {nums[3]} = 24\"\n        \n        # (a op1 b) op2 (c op3 d)\n        result3 = ops[1](ops[0](nums[0], nums[1]), ops[2](nums[2], nums[3]))\n        if result3 == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0].__name__} {nums[1]}) {ops[1].__name__} ({nums[2]} {ops[2].__name__} {nums[3]}) = 24\"\n        \n        # a op1 ((b op2 c) op3 d)\n        result4 = ops[0](nums[0], ops[2](ops[1](nums[1], nums[2]), nums[3]))\n        if result4 == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]} {ops[0].__name__} (({nums[1]} {ops[1].__name__} {nums[2]}) {ops[2].__name__} {nums[3]}) = 24\"\n        \n        # a op1 (b op2 (c op3 d))\n        result5 = ops[0](nums[0], ops[1](nums[1], ops[2](nums[2], nums[3])))\n        if result5 == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]} {ops[0].__name__} ({nums[1]} {ops[1].__name__} ({nums[2]} {ops[2].__name__} {nums[3]})) = 24\"\n        \n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        # Ignore division by zero errors\n        pass\n    \n    return None\n\ndef find_solution(numbers):\n    # Define the operations\n    operations = [lambda x, y: x + y, lambda x, y: x - y, lambda x, y: x * y, lambda x, y: x / y]\n    operations_names = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of numbers\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            solution = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if solution:\n                return f\"<<<{solution}>>>\"\n    \n    return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [1, 6, 6, 11]\n\n# Find and print the solution\nprint(find_solution(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code uses permutations to explore all possible orders of the numbers and uses the `product` function to try all combinations of operations. The `evaluate_expression` function checks different groupings of operations to find a valid equation that results in 24. If a solution is found, it is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code lacks complexity and does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the code, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations to find a valid solution. This will ensure that the code is robust and can handle a wider range of inputs."
