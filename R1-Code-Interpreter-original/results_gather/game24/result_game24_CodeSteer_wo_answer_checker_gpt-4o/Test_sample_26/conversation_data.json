    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 4, 6, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We can start by trying to use multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers like 24.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 4, we get 24.\n- We can then use the remaining numbers, 1 and 12, in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as adding 1 and subtracting 1.\n\nThus, the equation that works is: \\((6 \\times 4) + (12 - 12)\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (6 * 4) + (12 - 12)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((6*4)+(12-12))>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more systematically, we can use a brute-force approach that tries all permutations of the numbers and all possible combinations of operations and parentheses. This approach will ensure that we explore all potential solutions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Permutations of Numbers**: Generate all permutations of the input numbers. This will allow us to try every possible order of the numbers.\n\n2. **Operations**: Define the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) that can be used between the numbers.\n\n3. **Parentheses Combinations**: Consider all possible ways to insert parentheses in the expression. This is crucial because the order of operations can change the result.\n\n4. **Evaluation**: For each combination of numbers, operations, and parentheses, evaluate the expression to see if it equals 24.\n\n5. **Symbolic Computation**: Use Python's `itertools` for permutations and a custom function to evaluate expressions with different operations and parentheses.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport operator\n\n# Define the operations\nops = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.truediv]\nops_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression with given numbers and operations\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Try different parenthesis placements\n        # ((a op b) op c) op d\n        result1 = ops[2](ops[1](ops[0](nums[0], nums[1]), nums[2]), nums[3])\n        if result1 == 24:\n            return f\"(({nums[0]}{ops_symbols[0]}{nums[1]}){ops_symbols[1]}{nums[2]}){ops_symbols[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n        \n        # (a op (b op c)) op d\n        result2 = ops[2](ops[0](nums[0], ops[1](nums[1], nums[2])), nums[3])\n        if result2 == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]}{ops_symbols[0]}({nums[1]}{ops_symbols[1]}{nums[2]})){ops_symbols[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n        \n        # (a op b) op (c op d)\n        result3 = ops[1](ops[0](nums[0], nums[1]), ops[2](nums[2], nums[3]))\n        if result3 == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]}{ops_symbols[0]}{nums[1]}){ops_symbols[1]}({nums[2]}{ops_symbols[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        \n        # a op ((b op c) op d)\n        result4 = ops[0](nums[0], ops[2](ops[1](nums[1], nums[2]), nums[3]))\n        if result4 == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]}{ops_symbols[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops_symbols[1]}{nums[2]}){ops_symbols[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        \n        # a op (b op (c op d))\n        result5 = ops[0](nums[0], ops[1](nums[1], ops[2](nums[2], nums[3])))\n        if result5 == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]}{ops_symbols[0]}({nums[1]}{ops_symbols[1]}({nums[2]}{ops_symbols[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        \n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [1, 4, 6, 12]\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n    for ops_perm in itertools.product(ops, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops_perm)\n        if result:\n            print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations and parentheses to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24."

    "The current solution is too simplistic and does not fully utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching to explore all possible combinations of operations and groupings. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically tries all permutations of the numbers and all possible combinations of operations and parentheses. This approach will ensure that all potential solutions are explored, and the correct one is found. Use libraries or techniques that support symbolic computation to handle the complexity of the task."
