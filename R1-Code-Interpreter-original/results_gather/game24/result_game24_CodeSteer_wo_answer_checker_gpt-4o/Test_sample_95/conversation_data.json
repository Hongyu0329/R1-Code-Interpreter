    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 7, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others to reach 24.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 5 to get 25.\n- Subtract 7 to get 18.\n- Add 8 to get 26.\n- Subtract 2 to get 24.\n\nThis can be expressed as: \\(((5 \\times 5) - 7 + 8 - 2) = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (5 * 5) - 7 + 8 - 2\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((5*5)-7+8-2)>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem correctly, we need to explore all possible permutations of the numbers and apply all possible combinations of arithmetic operations. We also need to consider different ways to group the numbers using parentheses to respect the order of operations. This can be achieved using a recursive function or a backtracking algorithm.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers. Since we have four numbers, there are \\(4! = 24\\) permutations.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n3. Use parentheses to group the numbers in different ways to respect the order of operations.\n4. Check if any of these combinations result in 24.\n5. Return the first valid equation found.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        try:\n            if eval(expr) == 24:\n                return expr\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n    return None\n\ndef find_solution(numbers):\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [5, 5, 7, 8]\nsolution = find_solution(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will explore all possible combinations and permutations of the numbers and operations, checking for a valid equation that results in 24. The first valid equation found will be printed in the required format."

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect as it does not use all the numbers exactly once, and the arithmetic operations do not yield the correct result. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex approach that involves generating all possible permutations of the numbers and applying all possible combinations of arithmetic operations. This can be achieved using a recursive function or a backtracking algorithm to explore all potential solutions. Additionally, ensure that the solution checks for the correct use of parentheses to respect the order of operations. This approach will help in finding a valid equation that results in 24."
