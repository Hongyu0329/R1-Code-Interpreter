    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 3, 8, 12, 12.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 12, 12, and 3 to form the expression: \\((12 / (12 / 3))\\).\n- This simplifies to \\((12 / 4)\\), which equals 3.\n- Then, multiply this result by 8: \\(3 * 8 = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to demonstrate this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 3\nb = 8\nc = 12\nd = 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = (c / (d / a)) * b\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({c}/({d}/{a}))*{b}>>>\")\n```",
    "To improve the solution and explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations, we can implement a recursive function that tries different permutations of the numbers and applies various arithmetic operations. This approach will ensure that we consider all potential solutions.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the input numbers. Since we have four numbers, there are \\(4! = 24\\) permutations.\n2. For each permutation, recursively apply different arithmetic operations between the numbers.\n3. Use a helper function to evaluate expressions and check if they equal 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the current permutation of numbers and operations\n    a, b, c, d = nums\n    op1, op2, op3 = ops\n    \n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    try:\n        if eval(f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d})))\") == 24:\n            return f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d})))\"\n        if eval(f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\"\n        if eval(f\"(({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d})\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d})\"\n        if eval(f\"({a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d}))\") == 24:\n            return f\"({a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d}))\"\n        if eval(f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\"\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    # Define possible operations\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for op1 in operations:\n            for op2 in operations:\n                for op3 in operations:\n                    result = evaluate_expression(perm, (op1, op2, op3))\n                    if result:\n                        return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [3, 8, 12, 12]\n\n# Find and print the expression\nprint(find_expression(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code systematically explores all permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations, checking each possible expression to see if it evaluates to 24. If a valid expression is found, it is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code lacks complexity and does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. This can be achieved by using recursive functions or backtracking algorithms to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This approach will ensure that all potential solutions are considered, and the most efficient one is found."
