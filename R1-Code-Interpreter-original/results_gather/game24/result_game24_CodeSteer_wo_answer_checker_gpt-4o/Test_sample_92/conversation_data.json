    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 6, 11, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 5, 6, 11, and 13.\n- Calculate: \\((5 \\times 6) - (13 - 11)\\).\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (5 * 6) - (13 - 11)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((5*6)-(13-11))>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem in a more systematic and efficient way, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations. This approach will involve:\n\n1. Generating all permutations of the numbers to consider different orders.\n2. Using a recursive function to try all possible combinations of operations between the numbers.\n3. Evaluating each expression to check if it equals 24.\n4. Using symbolic computation to handle the expressions and ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nHere's how we can implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Create symbolic variables for the numbers\n    a, b, c, d = symbols('a b c d')\n    # Create the expression using the given operations\n    expr = f\"(({a}{ops[0]}{b}){ops[1]}({c}{ops[2]}{d}))\"\n    # Substitute the numbers into the expression\n    expr = expr.replace('a', str(nums[0])).replace('b', str(nums[1]))\n    expr = expr.replace('c', str(nums[2])).replace('d', str(nums[3]))\n    # Simplify the expression and check if it equals 24\n    return simplify(expr) == 24, expr\n\ndef find_solution(numbers):\n    # Define possible operations\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in permutations(operations, 3):\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            is_valid, expr = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n            if is_valid:\n                return expr\n    return None\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [5, 6, 11, 13]\nsolution = find_solution(numbers)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nif solution:\n    print(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically explores all permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. It uses symbolic computation to handle the expressions and ensure correctness."

    "The current solution uses a straightforward approach with direct mathematical operations, which may not be sufficient for more complex cases. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that can explore various combinations of numbers and operations systematically. You might want to use a recursive function or backtracking to try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This approach will allow you to handle more complex scenarios and ensure that all possible solutions are considered. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, incorporating symbolic computing and efficient searching techniques."
