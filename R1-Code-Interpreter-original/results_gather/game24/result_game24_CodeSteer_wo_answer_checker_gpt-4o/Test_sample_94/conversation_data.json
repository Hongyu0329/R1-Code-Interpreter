    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 8.\n- Calculate: (8 - 1) * (3 + 7)\n\nThis results in 24 because:\n- (8 - 1) = 7\n- (3 + 7) = 10\n- 7 * 10 = 70\n\nHowever, this doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 8.\n- Calculate: (8 / (1 - (3 / 7)))\n\nThis results in 24 because:\n- (3 / 7) = 0.4286 (approximately)\n- (1 - 0.4286) = 0.5714 (approximately)\n- 8 / 0.5714 = 14 (approximately)\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 8.\n- Calculate: (8 * 3) - (7 + 1)\n\nThis results in 24 because:\n- (8 * 3) = 24\n- (7 + 1) = 8\n- 24 - 8 = 16\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 8.\n- Calculate: (8 * 3) - (7 - 1)\n\nThis results in 24 because:\n- (8 * 3) = 24\n- (7 - 1) = 6\n- 24 - 6 = 18\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24.
