    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 8, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We will test different combinations systematically.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 5, 8, and 9.\n- Calculate: (9 - 1) * (8 - 5) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to demonstrate this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 1\nb = 5\nc = 8\nd = 9\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = (d - a) * (c - b)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({d}-{a})*({c}-{b})>>>\")\n```",
    "To improve the code and make it more robust, we can implement a recursive backtracking algorithm that systematically explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. This approach will allow us to handle a wider range of inputs and find solutions more efficiently.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Define a recursive function that takes a list of numbers and a target value (24 in this case).\n2. Use a loop to iterate over all pairs of numbers and apply each of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n3. For each operation, create a new list of numbers by replacing the pair with the result of the operation.\n4. Recursively call the function with the new list of numbers.\n5. If the list is reduced to a single number that equals the target, print the solution.\n6. Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef find_expression(numbers, target=24):\n    # Helper function to evaluate expressions\n    def evaluate(nums, expr):\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            if abs(nums[0] - target) < 1e-6:  # Check if the result is close to the target\n                print(f\"<<<{expr}>>>\")\n                return True\n            return False\n        \n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n                # Try all operations\n                for op in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n                    if op == '/' and nums[j] == 0:\n                        continue  # Avoid division by zero\n                    \n                    # Calculate new number\n                    if op == '+':\n                        new_num = nums[i] + nums[j]\n                    elif op == '-':\n                        new_num = nums[i] - nums[j]\n                    elif op == '*':\n                        new_num = nums[i] * nums[j]\n                    elif op == '/':\n                        new_num = nums[i] / nums[j]\n                    \n                    # Create new list of numbers\n                    new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j] + [new_num]\n                    new_expr = f\"({expr[i]}{op}{expr[j]})\"\n                    \n                    # Recursively evaluate\n                    if evaluate(new_nums, [new_expr] + [expr[k] for k in range(len(expr)) if k != i and k != j]):\n                        return True\n        return False\n\n    # Try all permutations of numbers\n    for perm in permutations(numbers):\n        if evaluate(list(perm), list(map(str, perm))):\n            break\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 5, 8, 9]\nfind_expression(numbers)\n```\n\nThis code uses permutations to try all possible orders of the numbers and recursively evaluates all possible expressions using the basic arithmetic operations. It prints the first valid expression that evaluates to 24."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code lacks complexity and does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques. To improve the code, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that systematically explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. This could involve using recursive functions or backtracking algorithms to ensure all potential solutions are considered. Aim to generate code that can handle a wider range of inputs and find solutions more efficiently."
