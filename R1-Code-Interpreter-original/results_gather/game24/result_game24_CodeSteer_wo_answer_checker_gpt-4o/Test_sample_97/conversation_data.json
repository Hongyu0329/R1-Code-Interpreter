    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 3, 4, and 5 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We can start by trying to multiply some numbers to get close to 24 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- Multiplying 5 and 4 gives us 20.\n- Adding 3 to 20 gives us 23.\n- Adding the last 3 gives us 26.\n- Subtracting 2 (which is 3 - 1) from 26 gives us 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to reflect this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 3, 3, 4, and 5\nresult = (5 * 4) + 3 + 3 - 2\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((5*4)+3+3-2)>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a brute-force approach to try all possible permutations of the numbers and all possible combinations of arithmetic operations. We will also consider different ways to group the numbers using parentheses. This approach ensures that we explore all possibilities to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all combinations of arithmetic operations.\n3. Use different groupings with parentheses to evaluate the expressions.\n4. Check if any of these expressions evaluate to 24.\n5. Print the first valid expression found.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        try:\n            if eval(expr) == 24:\n                return expr\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if expr:\n                return expr\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [3, 3, 4, 5]\nsolution = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, checking each possible parenthesization to find an expression that evaluates to 24."

    "The current solution does not correctly use all the numbers provided in the input, and the arithmetic operations do not yield the correct result. To improve the solution, consider using a more systematic approach to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations. Implement a search algorithm that tries different permutations of the numbers and applies various arithmetic operations to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24. This approach will ensure that all possibilities are considered, and the correct solution is found."
