    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 7, 9, 11, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 7, 9, 11, 11.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations (+, -, *, /) that results in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 11 and 11 to perform subtraction: \\(11 - 11 = 0\\).\n- Add 9 to the result: \\(0 + 9 = 9\\).\n- Multiply the result by 7: \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\).\n- Finally, divide by 3 (which is the result of \\(11 - 8\\)): \\(63 / 3 = 21\\).\n\nHowever, this doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 11 and 11 to perform addition: \\(11 + 11 = 22\\).\n- Add 9 to the result: \\(22 + 9 = 31\\).\n- Subtract 7 from the result: \\(31 - 7 = 24\\).\n\nThis gives us the desired result of 24. Let's write the Python code to reflect this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 7\nb = 9\nc = 11\nd = 11\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = (c + d) + b - a\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({c} + {d}) + {b} - {a} = {result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final answer in the required format.",
    "To implement a more sophisticated approach, we can use a recursive function to explore all possible permutations of the numbers and apply different arithmetic operations. This approach will systematically try different combinations until the desired result is found. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, recursively apply all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Check if any combination results in 24.\n4. If a valid combination is found, print the equation.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport operator\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [7, 9, 11, 11]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.truediv]\noperation_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the expression given numbers and operations.\"\"\"\n    result = nums[0]\n    expression = str(nums[0])\n    for i in range(3):\n        result = ops[i](result, nums[i + 1])\n        expression = f\"({expression} {operation_symbols[operations.index(ops[i])]} {nums[i + 1]})\"\n    return result, expression\n\ndef find_solution():\n    \"\"\"Find a solution that results in the target value.\"\"\"\n    for perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in permutations(operations, 3):\n            try:\n                result, expression = evaluate_expression(perm, ops)\n                if abs(result - target) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating-point precision\n                    return expression\n            except ZeroDivisionError:\n                continue\n    return None\n\nsolution = find_solution()\nif solution:\n    print(f\"<<<{solution} = {target}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will explore all permutations of the numbers and apply all possible combinations of operations to find a solution that results in 24. It will print the first valid equation it finds.",
    "Let's refine the code to ensure it correctly considers all permutations of operations and handles division and floating-point precision more robustly. We'll also ensure that the number of operations matches the number of gaps between numbers, which is one less than the number of numbers.\n\nHere's the improved code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\nimport operator\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [7, 9, 11, 11]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.truediv]\noperation_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the expression given numbers and operations.\"\"\"\n    result = nums[0]\n    expression = str(nums[0])\n    for i in range(3):\n        try:\n            result = ops[i](result, nums[i + 1])\n            expression = f\"({expression} {operation_symbols[operations.index(ops[i])]} {nums[i + 1]})\"\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            return None, None\n    return result, expression\n\ndef find_solution():\n    \"\"\"Find a solution that results in the target value.\"\"\"\n    for perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            result, expression = evaluate_expression(perm, ops)\n            if result is not None and abs(result - target) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating-point precision\n                return expression\n    return None\n\nsolution = find_solution()\nif solution:\n    print(f\"<<<{solution} = {target}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n1. **Operation Permutations**: We use `product(operations, repeat=3)` to ensure all combinations of three operations are considered, matching the number of gaps between four numbers.\n2. **Zero Division Handling**: We catch `ZeroDivisionError` within the loop to skip invalid operations.\n3. **Floating-Point Precision**: We use a small tolerance (`1e-6`) to compare floating-point results to the target, ensuring precision issues do not affect the outcome.\n\nThis refined code should correctly find a valid solution if one exists."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code lacks complexity and symbolic computing. To improve, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that explores all possible combinations and operations using the given numbers. This can be achieved by using recursive functions or backtracking to systematically try different permutations and operations until the desired result is found. This approach will ensure that all potential solutions are considered, and it will enhance the code's complexity and efficiency.",
    "The current approach uses a systematic search with permutations and recursive evaluation, which is a good step towards a more complex solution. However, the code did not find a solution, indicating that the logic might need refinement. Consider the following improvements:\n\n1. Ensure that all permutations of operations are considered correctly, especially since the number of operations is one less than the number of numbers.\n2. Double-check the logic for evaluating expressions, particularly the handling of division and potential zero division errors.\n3. Consider using a more robust method for floating-point comparison to ensure precision issues do not affect the result.\n\nRefine the code to address these points and ensure it can find a valid solution if one exists."
