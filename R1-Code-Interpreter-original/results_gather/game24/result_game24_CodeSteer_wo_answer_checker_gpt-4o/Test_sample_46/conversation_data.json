    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Consider the target number 24 and think about how it can be achieved using the given numbers.\n2. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n3. Notice that 12 is a large number, and multiplying it by 2 gives us 24. This suggests that we can use multiplication to reach 24.\n4. We can use the numbers 1 and 3 to adjust the equation to use all numbers.\n\nLet's try to form an equation:\n\n- Start with 12 and multiply it by 2 to get 24.\n- Use the number 3 to divide 12 by 3, which gives us 4.\n- Multiply 4 by 6 (which is 2 * 3) to get 24.\n\nNow, let's write the equation:\n\n- (12 / 3) * (2 * 3) = 24\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this equation:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 2, 3, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the equation\nresult = (d / c) * (b * c)\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"<<<({d} / {c}) * ({b} * {c}) = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can implement a recursive backtracking algorithm. This approach will systematically explore different combinations of numbers and operations to find a valid equation that results in 24. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that takes a list of numbers and tries to combine them using basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number (24 in this case).\n\n2. **Base Case**: If the list contains only one number, check if it equals 24. If it does, return the equation as a string.\n\n3. **Recursive Case**: For each pair of numbers in the list, apply each arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /) and recursively call the function with the new list of numbers (after replacing the pair with the result of the operation).\n\n4. **Avoid Division by Zero**: Ensure that division operations do not result in division by zero.\n\n5. **Track Equations**: Keep track of the equations formed at each step to output the final equation when 24 is reached.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_equation_to_24(numbers):\n    def helper(nums, equation):\n        if len(nums) == 1:\n            if abs(nums[0] - 24) < 1e-6:  # Check if the result is 24\n                return equation\n            return None\n        \n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n                # Try all operations\n                for op in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n                    if op == '/' and nums[j] == 0:\n                        continue  # Avoid division by zero\n                    \n                    # Calculate new number\n                    if op == '+':\n                        new_num = nums[i] + nums[j]\n                    elif op == '-':\n                        new_num = nums[i] - nums[j]\n                    elif op == '*':\n                        new_num = nums[i] * nums[j]\n                    elif op == '/':\n                        new_num = nums[i] / nums[j]\n                    \n                    # Form new list of numbers\n                    new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j]\n                    new_nums.append(new_num)\n                    \n                    # Form new equation\n                    new_equation = f\"({equation[i]} {op} {equation[j]})\"\n                    \n                    # Recursive call\n                    result = helper(new_nums, [new_equation] + [equation[k] for k in range(len(equation)) if k != i and k != j])\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n        return None\n\n    # Initial call with numbers and their string representations\n    initial_equation = [str(num) for num in numbers]\n    return helper(numbers, initial_equation)\n\n# Test the function with the given input\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 12]\nequation = find_equation_to_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{equation}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will explore different combinations of operations and numbers to find a valid equation that results in 24, and it will print the equation in the specified format."

    "The current solution uses a straightforward approach with direct mathematical operations, which may not be sufficient for more complex cases. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that explores different combinations of operations and numbers. You can use techniques such as backtracking or recursive search to systematically try different possibilities and find a valid equation that results in 24. This approach will allow the code to handle a wider range of inputs effectively."
