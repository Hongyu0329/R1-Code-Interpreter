    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 4, and 6 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 4, and 6.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations (+, -, *, /) that results in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- If we multiply 6 by 4, we get 24.\n- We can use the two 1s in a way that doesn't change the result, such as adding them together and then subtracting them from the result.\n\nThus, the equation that works is: \\( (6 \\times 4) + (1 - 1) = 24 \\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (6 * 4) + (1 - 1)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<(6*4)+(1-1)>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more efficiently, we can implement a recursive function that explores all possible combinations of the given numbers and operations. This approach will systematically generate and evaluate potential expressions to find the correct one that results in 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that takes a list of numbers and tries all possible combinations of operations between them.\n2. **Base Case**: If there's only one number left, check if it equals 24.\n3. **Recursive Case**: For each pair of numbers, apply each operation (+, -, *, /) and recursively solve the problem with the new list of numbers.\n4. **Symbolic Representation**: Keep track of the operations and numbers used to form the expression.\n5. **Output**: Once a valid expression is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]})\"\n    result = eval(expression)\n    for i in range(2, len(nums)):\n        expression = f\"({expression}{ops[i-1]}{nums[i]})\"\n        result = eval(expression)\n    return result, expression\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n            try:\n                result, expression = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n                if abs(result - 24) < 1e-6:  # Consider floating-point precision\n                    return f\"<<<{expression}>>>\"\n            except ZeroDivisionError:\n                continue\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [1, 1, 4, 6]\nprint(find_expression_to_24(numbers))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Permutations**: We generate all permutations of the numbers to consider different orders.\n- **Product**: We generate all combinations of operations for the given number of slots.\n- **Evaluation**: We evaluate each generated expression and check if it equals 24.\n- **Precision**: We handle floating-point precision issues by checking if the result is close to 24.\n- **Zero Division**: We handle division by zero errors gracefully.\n\nThis code will explore all possible combinations and find the correct expression that evaluates to 24."

    "To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex and efficient algorithm that can explore various combinations of numbers and operations to find the correct equation. Utilize symbolic computing techniques to systematically generate and evaluate possible expressions. This approach will ensure that all potential solutions are considered, and the correct one is identified.
