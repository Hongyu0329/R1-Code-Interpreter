    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 10, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 3, 8, 10, and 11.\n- Calculate: ((11 - 8) * (10 - 3)) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to perform this calculation and print the result in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 3, 8, 10, 11\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = ((d - b) * (c - a))\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<((11 - 8) * (10 - 3)) = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can use a systematic approach to explore all possible combinations of numbers, operations, and groupings. This involves:\n\n1.

    "The current solution is incorrect as it does not yield the desired result of 24. The code lacks complexity and does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching to explore all possible combinations of operations and groupings. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that systematically tries all permutations of the numbers and all possible combinations of operations and parentheses. This can be achieved using recursive functions or backtracking algorithms to explore the solution space more effectively. Aim to generate code that can handle this complexity and find the correct solution.",
    "The current code attempts to solve the problem using a systematic search approach, which is a step in the right direction. However, there is a TypeError due to incorrect indexing of the `operation_symbols` list. To fix this, ensure that the correct index is used to access the operation symbols. You should map the operations to their corresponding symbols correctly. Additionally, ensure that the code handles all possible permutations and combinations effectively. Refine the code to address these issues and ensure it can find the correct solution."
