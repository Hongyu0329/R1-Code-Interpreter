    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 6, 6, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 6, 6, and 8.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 6, 6, and 8 to perform multiplication and addition.\n- Use the number 2 to divide the result.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Multiply 6 and 8 to get 48.\n2. Add the other 6 to get 54.\n3. Divide the result by 2 to get 27.\n4. Subtract 3 to get 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to perform these operations and print the result.\n\n```python\nresult = ((6 * 8) + 6) / 2\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the result in the required format.",
    "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of the numbers and operations. We'll use backtracking to try different permutations of the numbers and apply the operations in various ways to see if we can achieve the target result of 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible ways to insert the operations (+, -, *, /) between the numbers.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, format it according to the required output format and print it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the current permutation of numbers and operations\n    expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n    try:\n        if eval(expression) == 24:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [2, 6, 6, 8]\nsolution = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. If a solution is found, it will be printed in the required format."

    "The current approach is not yielding the correct result. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that explores all possible combinations of the numbers and operations. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This will help ensure that all potential solutions are considered. Additionally, ensure that the code correctly formats the final expression to match the required output format."
