    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 3, 13, and 13 to form an equation that results in 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 13s, which can be combined in various ways. One potential way is to add them together: 13 + 13 = 26.\n2. We can then use the remaining numbers, 1 and 3, to adjust this result to 24.\n3. Subtract 3 from 26 to get 23.\n4. Finally, add 1 to 23 to get 24.\n\nThe equation that satisfies these conditions is: (13 + 13) - 3 + 1 = 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 3, 13, 13\n\n# Calculate the result using the equation\nresult = (c + d) - b + a\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"<<<({c} + {d}) - {b} + {a} = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more sophisticated solution, we can implement a recursive function that explores different permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations. This approach will systematically try different possibilities until it finds a valid equation that results in 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the input numbers. This will allow us to try different orders of the numbers.\n2. Define a list of possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n3. Use a recursive function to try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n4. Check if any combination results in 24.\n5. If a valid equation is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the numbers and operations\n    result = nums[0]\n    expression = str(nums[0])\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n            expression += f\" + {nums[i + 1]}\"\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n            expression += f\" - {nums[i + 1]}\"\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n            expression += f\" * {nums[i + 1]}\"\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                return None, None  # Avoid division by zero\n            result /= nums[i + 1]\n            expression += f\" / {nums[i + 1]}\"\n    return result, expression\n\ndef find_equation_to_24(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            result, expression = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n            if result == 24:\n                return f\"<<<{expression} = 24>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [1, 3, 13, 13]\n\n# Find and print the equation\nprint(find_equation_to_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an equation that results in 24. If a solution is found, it will print the equation in the required format."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code is quite straightforward and lacks complexity. To improve the code, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that explores different combinations and permutations of the numbers and operations to find a solution. This could involve using a recursive function or backtracking algorithm to systematically try different possibilities until the correct equation is found. This approach will not only solve the current problem but also be adaptable to similar problems with different inputs."
