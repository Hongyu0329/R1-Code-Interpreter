    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 8, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 2, 8, and 12.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 24.\n3. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to achieve this.\n\nLet's try to find a combination:\n\n- We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers.\n- If we multiply 2 and 12, we get 24. However, we still need to use the other two numbers.\n- Let's try using the other two numbers in a way that doesn't change the result of 24.\n\nAfter some trial and error, we find that:\n\n- If we multiply 2 and 12, we get 24.\n- We can then add 2 and 8, which gives us 10.\n- Subtracting 10 from 24 gives us 14, which is not correct.\n- Let's try another approach.\n\nFinally, we find a correct combination:\n\n- Multiply 2 and 8 to get 16.\n- Add the other 2 to get 18.\n- Add 12 to 18 to get 30.\n- Subtract 6 (which is 2 + 2) from 30 to get 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to represent this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 2, 2, 8, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the correct combination of operations\nresult = (a * c) + b + d - (a + b)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({a}*{c})+{b}+{d}-({a}+{b})>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more systematically, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations. This involves:\n\n1. Generating all permutations of the numbers.\n2. Trying all possible combinations of operations between these numbers.\n3. Evaluating each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. Using recursion to handle different groupings of numbers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n- Generate all permutations of the numbers to ensure each number is used exactly once in different orders.\n- For each permutation, recursively try all possible ways to insert operations and parentheses.\n- Evaluate each expression to check if it equals 24.\n- If a valid expression is found, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport operator\n\n# Define the operations\nops = [('+', operator.add), ('-', operator.sub), ('*', operator.mul), ('/', operator.truediv)]\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the expression with the given numbers and operations.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Try different groupings by evaluating the expression in different orders\n        result1 = ops[1][1](ops[0][1](nums[0], nums[1]), ops[2][1](nums[2], nums[3]))\n        result2 = ops[0][1](nums[0], ops[1][1](nums[1], ops[2][1](nums[2], nums[3])))\n        result3 = ops[0][1](ops[1][1](nums[0], nums[1]), ops[2][1](nums[2], nums[3]))\n        result4 = ops[2][1](ops[0][1](nums[0], nums[1]), ops[1][1](nums[2], nums[3]))\n        \n        # Check if any result equals 24\n        if any(abs(result - 24) < 1e-6 for result in [result1, result2, result3, result4]):\n            return True\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return False\n    return False\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    \"\"\"Find an expression that evaluates to 24.\"\"\"\n    for num_perm in permutations(nums):\n        for op_perm in permutations(ops, 3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, op_perm):\n                # Construct the expression string\n                expr = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{op_perm[0][0]}{num_perm[1]}){op_perm[1][0]}({num_perm[2]}{op_perm[2][0]}{num_perm[3]}))\"\n                return expr\n    return None\n\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [2, 2, 8, 12]\n\n# Find and print the expression\nexpression = find_expression(numbers)\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically explores all permutations of the numbers and operations, evaluating each possible expression to find one that equals 24. If a valid expression is found, it prints it in the required format."

    "The current approach lacks symbolic computing and efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically explores all possible combinations of operations and groupings. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to try different permutations of the numbers and operations, ensuring that each number is used exactly once. This will help in finding the correct combination that results in 24. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code rather than simply displaying the answer."
