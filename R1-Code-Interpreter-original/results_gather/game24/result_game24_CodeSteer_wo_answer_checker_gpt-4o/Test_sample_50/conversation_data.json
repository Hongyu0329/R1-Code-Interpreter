    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 12, 12, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have three 12s and one 2. We can try to use multiplication and division to reach 24.\n2. Notice that 12 * 2 = 24. This is a straightforward way to reach 24 using two of the numbers.\n3. We still need to use the remaining two 12s. We can use them in a way that doesn't change the result, such as adding and subtracting them.\n\nLet's construct the equation:\n\n- Start with 12 * 2 to get 24.\n- Use the remaining two 12s in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as adding and then subtracting them.\n\nThe equation can be: \\((12 \\times 2) + (12 - 12)\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this equation:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 2, 12, 12, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the equation\nresult = (b * a) + (c - d)\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"<<<({b} * {a}) + ({c} - {d})>>>\")\n```",
    "To address the problem more systematically and efficiently, we can implement a recursive backtracking algorithm. This approach will explore different combinations and permutations of the numbers and operations to find a valid equation that results in 24. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Permutations of Numbers**: Generate all possible permutations of the input numbers. This ensures that we consider every possible order of the numbers.\n\n2. **Combinations of Operations**: For each permutation of numbers, try all possible combinations of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n\n3. **Recursive Evaluation**: Use a recursive function to evaluate different groupings of numbers and operations. This will allow us to explore different ways to parenthesize the expression.\n\n4. **Check for Validity**: For each combination, check if the result is 24. If it is, print the equation.\n\n5. **Output**: Once a valid equation is found, output it in the specified format.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    try:\n        # ((a op1 b) op2 c) op3 d\n        if eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\") == 24:\n            return f\"((({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        # (a op1 (b op2 c)) op3 d\n        if eval(f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\") == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n        # (a op1 b) op2 (c op3 d)\n        if eval(f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\") == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        # a op1 ((b op2 c) op3 d)\n        if eval(f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\") == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        # a op1 (b op2 (c op3 d))\n        if eval(f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\") == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_for_24(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [2, 12, 12, 12]\n\n# Find and print the expression\nprint(find_expression_for_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try different combinations and permutations of the numbers and operations, checking for a valid equation that results in 24. If a solution is found, it will be printed in the specified format."

    "The current solution uses a straightforward approach to solve the problem, but it lacks the complexity needed for symbolic computing and efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that explores different combinations and permutations of the numbers and operations. This could involve using recursive functions or backtracking to systematically try different possibilities until the correct equation is found. Aim to generate code that can handle a wider range of inputs and find solutions more efficiently."
