    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 8, 8, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 8, 8, and 13.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 8, 8, and 2 to perform multiplication and division: \\( (8 \\times 3) = 24 \\).\n- To get 3, we can use the numbers 13 and 2: \\( (13 - 8) = 5 \\) and then \\( (5 - 2) = 3 \\).\n\nThus, the equation is: \\((8 \\times (13 - 8 - 2)) = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 2, 8, 8, 13\n\n# Calculate the result using the derived equation\nresult = (b * (d - b - a))\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations. We'll use backtracking to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This approach will ensure that all potential solutions are considered.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Use a recursive function to evaluate each combination.\n4. Check if the result equals 24.\n5. Use a symbolic computing library like SymPy to handle arithmetic operations and expressions.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [2, 8, 8, 13]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define the operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Define a function to evaluate expressions\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    x, y, z, w = symbols('x y z w')\n    expr = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n    try:\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        if solve(Eq(eval(expr), target)):\n            return expr\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and combinations of operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations, using SymPy to evaluate the expressions. If a valid expression that equals 24 is found, it will be printed in the required format."

    "The current solution lacks symbolic computing and efficient searching, which are crucial for solving this type of problem effectively. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. You can use a recursive approach or backtracking to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This will ensure that all potential solutions are considered, and the correct one is found.
