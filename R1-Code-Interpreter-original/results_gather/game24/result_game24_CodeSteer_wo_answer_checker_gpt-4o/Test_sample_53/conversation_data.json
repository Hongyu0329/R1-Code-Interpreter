    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 6, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 6, 6, and 13.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations (+, -, *, /) that results in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 6 and 6 to multiply, which gives us 36.\n- Subtract 13 from 36, which gives us 23.\n- Add 1 to 23, which gives us 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to represent this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 1\nb = 6\nc = 6\nd = 13\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = (b * c) - d + a\n\n# Print the final equation and result\nprint(f\"<<<({b}*{c})-{d}+{a}={result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To tackle this problem with a more sophisticated approach, we can use a recursive function to explore all possible permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations. We'll use the `itertools` library to generate permutations and the `SymPy` library to handle symbolic expressions. This approach will systematically try different combinations until it finds a valid expression that evaluates to 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the input numbers.\n2. Generate all possible combinations of operations for each permutation.\n3. Use a recursive function to evaluate each combination of numbers and operations.\n4. Use the `SymPy` library to handle symbolic expressions and evaluate them.\n5. Stop when a valid expression that evaluates to 24 is found.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the numbers and operations\nnumbers = [1, 6, 6, 13]\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Define a function to evaluate expressions\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    x, y, z, w = symbols('x y z w')\n    expr = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n    try:\n        if solve(Eq(eval(expr), 24)):\n            return expr\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and combinations of operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops_comb in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops_comb)\n        if result:\n            print(f\"<<<{result} = 24>>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations, using symbolic computation to evaluate each expression. It will print the first valid expression that evaluates to 24."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code lacks complexity and symbolic computing. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. This can be achieved by using recursive functions or backtracking algorithms to systematically try different permutations and combinations. Additionally, consider using symbolic computing libraries like SymPy to handle expressions more effectively. Aim to generate a solution that not only finds the correct answer but also demonstrates a more complex and efficient search strategy."
