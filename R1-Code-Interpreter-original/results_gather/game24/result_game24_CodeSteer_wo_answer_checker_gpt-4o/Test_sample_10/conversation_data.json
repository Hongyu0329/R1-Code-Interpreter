    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 5 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have two 1s and two 5s.\n2. We need to find a combination of operations that will result in 24.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider how we can use multiplication and addition to reach 24, given that we have two 5s which can be multiplied to get 25, and then adjust using the 1s.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n- Multiply the two 5s to get 25.\n- Subtract one of the 1s from 25 to get 24.\n- Use the remaining 1 in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as adding and then subtracting it.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to implement this plan:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 1, 5, 5\n\n# Calculate the result using the numbers and operations\nresult = (c * d) - a + b - b\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({c}*{d})-{a}+{b}-{b}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations of operations and parentheses. This involves trying different permutations of the numbers and applying different operations between them. We will use a recursive function to systematically try each combination and check if it results in 24.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the input numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible ways to insert parentheses and operations.\n3. Use a recursive function to evaluate each expression.\n4. If an expression evaluates to 24, print it in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport operator\n\n# Define the operations\nops = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.truediv]\nops_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try all possible ways to insert parentheses\n    try:\n        # ((a op1 b) op2 c) op3 d\n        result1 = ops[2](ops[1](ops[0](nums[0], nums[1]), nums[2]), nums[3])\n        if result1 == 24:\n            return f\"((({nums[0]} {ops_symbols[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops_symbols[1]} {nums[2]}) {ops_symbols[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        \n        # (a op1 (b op2 c)) op3 d\n        result2 = ops[2](ops[0](nums[0], ops[1](nums[1], nums[2])), nums[3])\n        if result2 == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]} {ops_symbols[0]} ({nums[1]} {ops_symbols[1]} {nums[2]})) {ops_symbols[2]} {nums[3]}\"\n        \n        # (a op1 b) op2 (c op3 d)\n        result3 = ops[1](ops[0](nums[0], nums[1]), ops[2](nums[2], nums[3]))\n        if result3 == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]} {ops_symbols[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops_symbols[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops_symbols[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        \n        # a op1 ((b op2 c) op3 d)\n        result4 = ops[0](nums[0], ops[2](ops[1](nums[1], nums[2]), nums[3]))\n        if result4 == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]} {ops_symbols[0]} (({nums[1]} {ops_symbols[1]} {nums[2]}) {ops_symbols[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        \n        # a op1 (b op2 (c op3 d))\n        result5 = ops[0](nums[0], ops[1](nums[1], ops[2](nums[2], nums[3])))\n        if result5 == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]} {ops_symbols[0]} ({nums[1]} {ops_symbols[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops_symbols[2]} {nums[3]}))\"\n        \n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    for num_perm in permutations(nums):\n        for op_perm in permutations(ops, 3):\n            expression = evaluate_expression(num_perm, op_perm)\n            if expression:\n                return expression\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [1, 1, 5, 5]\n\n# Find and print the expression\nexpression = find_expression(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and operations, checking each possible expression to see if it evaluates to 24. If a valid expression is found, it will be printed in the required format."

    "The current approach lacks symbolic computing and efficient searching, which are crucial for solving this task effectively. Consider implementing a more complex algorithm that explores all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to achieve the target result. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try different combinations and check if they yield the desired result of 24. This will ensure that all potential solutions are considered, and the correct one is found."
