    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 8, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n- We can start by trying to combine numbers in pairs and see if we can reach 24.\n- One possible approach is to try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 8, we get 48.\n- Then, if we subtract 9
