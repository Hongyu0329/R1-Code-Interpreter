    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 12 in the equation: \\((5 - 1) \\times (12 - 6)\\).\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 5, 6, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the equation\nresult = (b - a) * (d - c)\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"<<<({b} - {a}) * ({d} - {c}) = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To improve the solution and make it more systematic, we can implement a recursive backtracking algorithm. This approach will explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations to find a valid equation that results in 24. The algorithm will:\n\n1. Use a recursive function to try all permutations of the numbers.\n2. Apply all possible combinations of arithmetic operations between the numbers.\n3. Use parentheses to change the order of operations and explore different groupings.\n4. Check if any combination results in 24, and if so, print the equation.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n        f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        try:\n            if eval(expr) == 24:\n                return expr\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n    return None\n\ndef find_solution(numbers):\n    operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operators, repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [1, 5, 6, 12]\nsolution = find_solution(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution} = 24>>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Permutations**: We generate all possible orderings of the numbers using `itertools.permutations`.\n- **Product**: We generate all possible combinations of three operators using `itertools.product`.\n- **Evaluate Expression**: We define a function `evaluate_expression` that tries different ways to parenthesize the expression and checks if it evaluates to 24.\n- **Recursive Search**: The `find_solution` function iterates over all permutations of numbers and combinations of operators, using `evaluate_expression` to check for a valid solution.\n- **Output**: If a valid expression is found, it is printed in the required format. If no solution is found, it returns \"No solution found\". \n\nThis approach is more systematic and can handle a wider range of inputs efficiently."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code is quite simple and lacks symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the code, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that can systematically explore different combinations of operations and groupings to find the solution. This could involve using recursive functions or backtracking to try all possible combinations of the numbers and operations. Aim to generate code that can handle a wider range of inputs and find solutions more efficiently."
