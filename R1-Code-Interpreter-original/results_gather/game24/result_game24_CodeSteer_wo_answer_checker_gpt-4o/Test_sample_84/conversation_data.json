    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how it can be combined with the others.\n- We can try adding or subtracting the other numbers from 13 to see if we can reach 24.\n- Alternatively, we can try multiplying or dividing the numbers to see if that helps.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- ((13 - 9) * (9 - 2)) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 2, 9, 9, 13\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen equation\nresult = ((d - b) * (c - a))\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"<<<(({d} - {b}) * ({c} - {a})) = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic approach, we can implement a recursive function that explores all possible permutations of the numbers and all possible combinations of arithmetic operations. This approach will ensure that we consider every possible way to combine the numbers to reach the target value of 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers. Since the order of operations matters, we need to consider different orders of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of the operations (+, -, *, /) between the numbers.\n3. Use parentheses to explore different groupings of operations, as the order of operations can affect the result.\n4. Check if any combination results in 24, and if so, print the equation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    try:\n        # ((a op1 b) op2 c) op3 d\n        if eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\") == 24:\n            return f\"((({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} {nums[2]}) {ops[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        # (a op1 (b op2 c)) op3 d\n        if eval(f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\") == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} ({nums[1]} {ops[1]} {nums[2]})) {ops[2]} {nums[3]}\"\n        # (a op1 b) op2 (c op3 d)\n        if eval(f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\") == 24:\n            return f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        # a op1 ((b op2 c) op3 d)\n        if eval(f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\") == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]} {ops[0]} (({nums[1]} {ops[1]} {nums[2]}) {ops[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        # a op1 (b op2 (c op3 d))\n        if eval(f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\") == 24:\n            return f\"{nums[0]} {ops[0]} ({nums[1]} {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]}))\"\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_for_24(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return f\"<<<{result} = 24>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [2, 9, 9, 13]\n\n# Find and print the expression\nprint(find_expression_for_24(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, checking each possible parenthesization to see if it results in 24. If a valid equation is found, it will be printed."

    "The current approach is not yielding the correct result. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers with the operations (+, -, *, /) to find a valid equation that results in 24. This approach will ensure that all possibilities are considered, increasing the likelihood of finding the correct solution."
