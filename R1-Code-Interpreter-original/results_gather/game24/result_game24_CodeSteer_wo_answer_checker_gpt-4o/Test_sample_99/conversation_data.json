    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 3, 9, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two pairs of numbers: 3 and 9.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations to see if we can reach 24.\n3. One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition, as these operations can help us reach larger numbers.\n\nLet's try the following steps:\n\n- Multiply one pair of 3 and 9: \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\).\n- Subtract the other pair of 3 from 27: \\(27 - 3 = 24\\).\n\nThis gives us the equation: \\((3 \\times 9) - 3 = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 3, 3, 9, 9\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = (a * c) - b\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"<<<({a} * {c}) - {b} = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more robust solution that can handle a wider range of inputs, we can implement a recursive function that tries different combinations of numbers and operations to reach the target value of 24. This approach will involve:\n\n1. Generating all possible permutations of the input numbers.\n2. Trying all possible combinations of arithmetic operations between these numbers.\n3. Using recursion to evaluate each combination and check if it results in 24.\n4. Returning the first valid equation found.\n\nHere's how we can implement this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport operator\n\n# Define the target value\nTARGET = 24\n\n# Define the operations\noperations = {\n    '+': operator.add,\n    '-': operator.sub,\n    '*': operator.mul,\n    '/': operator.truediv\n}\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the expression given numbers and operations.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            result = ops[i](result, nums[i + 1])\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    \"\"\"Find an expression that evaluates to the target value.\"\"\"\n    for num_perm in permutations(nums):\n        for ops in permutations(operations.values(), 3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == TARGET:\n                # Construct the expression string\n                expr = f\"({num_perm[0]} {list(operations.keys())[list(operations.values()).index(ops[0])]} {num_perm[1]})\"\n                expr = f\"({expr} {list(operations.keys())[list(operations.values()).index(ops[1])]} {num_perm[2]})\"\n                expr = f\"({expr} {list(operations.keys())[list(operations.values()).index(ops[2])]} {num_perm[3]})\"\n                return expr\n    return None\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [3, 3, 9, 9]\n\n# Find and print the expression\nexpression = find_expression(numbers)\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression} = {TARGET}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the given numbers and basic arithmetic operations. It uses permutations to try all possible orders of numbers and operations, and it evaluates each combination to see if it results in the target value. If a valid expression is found, it is printed in the specified format."

    "The current solution is correct for the given input, but the code lacks complexity and does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that can handle a wider range of inputs and find solutions using symbolic computing. You could explore using a recursive function or backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of operations and numbers to reach the target value of 24. This will make the solution more robust and adaptable to different sets of numbers."
