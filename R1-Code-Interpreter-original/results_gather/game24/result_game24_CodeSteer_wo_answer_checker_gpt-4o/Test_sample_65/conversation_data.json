    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 4, 5, and 5 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two pairs of numbers: 4 and 5.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations to see if we can reach 24.\n3. One possible approach is to multiply one pair and add the result to the product of the other pair.\n\nLet's try the following steps:\n\n- Multiply the first pair: 4 * 5 = 20\n- Multiply the second pair: 4 * 5 = 20\n- Add the two results: 20 + 4 = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to reflect this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 4, 4, 5, 5\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = (a * c) + b\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({a}*{c})+{b}={result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the equation and the result in the specified format.",
    "To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that all numbers are used exactly once and that the operations result in 24. A systematic approach involves trying all permutations of the numbers and all possible combinations of operations. We can use a recursive function to explore these possibilities.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. Return the first valid expression found.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different parenthesizations\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        try:\n            if eval(expr) == 24:\n                return expr\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_for_24(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if expr:\n                return expr\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [4, 4, 5, 5]\nsolution = find_expression_for_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, checking if any combination results in 24. It will print the first valid expression it finds."

    "The current solution does not correctly use all the numbers exactly once, as required by the task. To improve the solution, consider using a more complex approach that involves symbolic computing and efficient searching. You can explore all possible combinations of the numbers and operations to find a valid equation that results in 24. Implement a recursive function or use a library that supports symbolic computation to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This will ensure that all numbers are used exactly once and the correct solution is found."
