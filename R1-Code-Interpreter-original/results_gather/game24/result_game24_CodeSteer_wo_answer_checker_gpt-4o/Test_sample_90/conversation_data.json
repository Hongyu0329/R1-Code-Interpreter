    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 6, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 4, 6, 6, and 8.\n- Calculate: ((6 / (8 - 6)) * 4) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 4\nb = 6\nc = 6\nd = 8\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations and groupings\nresult = ((b / (d - c)) * a)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem, we can implement a recursive function that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. This approach will systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations to find a valid solution that results in 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Use a recursive function to evaluate different groupings with parentheses.\n4. Check if any combination results in 24.\n5. Print the first valid solution found.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try all possible ways to insert parentheses\n    a, b, c, d = nums\n    op1, op2, op3 = ops\n    \n    # Different ways to group the operations\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\",\n        f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d}\",\n        f\"({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d})\",\n        f\"{a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d})\",\n        f\"{a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        try:\n            if eval(expr) == 24:\n                return expr\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n    return None\n\ndef find_solution(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [4, 6, 6, 8]\nsolution = find_solution(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations, checking each possible way to group the operations with parentheses. It will print the first valid expression that evaluates to 24."

    "The current approach is not yielding the correct result. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that explores all possible combinations of numbers and operations. You can use a recursive function or backtracking to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This will help ensure that all possibilities are considered, increasing the chances of finding a valid solution. Additionally, ensure that the code correctly handles the order of operations and parentheses to achieve the desired result."
