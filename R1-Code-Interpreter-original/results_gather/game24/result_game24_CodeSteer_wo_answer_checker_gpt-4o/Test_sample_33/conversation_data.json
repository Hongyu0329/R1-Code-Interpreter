    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 10, and 10 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 10s, which can be useful for addition or multiplication.\n2. We can try to use multiplication to reach a higher number and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n3. Consider using one of the 10s to multiply with 3 or 7 to get closer to 24.\n4. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that:\n\n- Multiply 3 by 7 to get 21.\n- Add one of the 10s to 21 to get 31.\n- Subtract the other 10 from 31 to get 21.\n- Finally, add 3 to 21 to get 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to reflect this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 3, 7, 10, 10\n\n# Calculate the result using the operations\nresult = (a * b) + c - d\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({a}*{b})+{c}-{d}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible combinations and permutations of the numbers with different operations. This approach will systematically try different possibilities until the correct solution is found. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Permutations**: Generate all possible permutations of the input numbers. This allows us to try different orders of the numbers.\n\n2. **Operations**: For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) between the numbers.\n\n3. **Recursive Evaluation**: Use a recursive function to evaluate expressions formed by combining numbers and operations. Check if any of these expressions evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Output**: Once a valid expression is found, format it and print it.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the current permutation of numbers and operations\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        expression = str(nums[0])\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                    return None, None\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n            expression += f\" {ops[i]} {nums[i + 1]}\"\n        return result, expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None, None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Generate all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product('+-*/', repeat=3):\n            result, expression = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result == 24:\n                return expression\n    return None\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [3, 7, 10, 10]\n\n# Find and print the expression that evaluates to 24\nexpression = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nif expression:\n    print(f\"<<<{expression}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. If such an expression is found, it will be printed in the required format."

    "The current solution does not correctly solve the problem as it does not use all numbers exactly once to achieve the target of 24. The code lacks complexity and does not employ symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques. To improve, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that explores all possible combinations and permutations of the numbers with different operations. You can use recursive functions or backtracking to systematically try different possibilities until the correct solution is found. Aim to generate code that can handle similar problems with varying inputs effectively."
