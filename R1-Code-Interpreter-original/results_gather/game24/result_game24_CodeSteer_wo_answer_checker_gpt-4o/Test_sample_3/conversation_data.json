    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have three 2s and one 12.\n2. We need to find a combination of operations that will result in 24.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider how we can use multiplication and addition to reach 24, given that 12 is already half of 24. We can try to manipulate the 2s to complement the 12.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n- Start with the number 12.\n- We know that 12 * 2 = 24, so we can use one of the 2s to multiply with 12.\n- We are left with two 2s. We can use them in a way that doesn't affect the multiplication result, such as adding them together and then subtracting them back to zero.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to express this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 12\nresult = (12 * 2) + (2 - 2)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((12*2)+(2-2))>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more dynamic solution that can handle various inputs and find the correct combination of numbers and operations to achieve the target result (24 in this case), we can use a recursive approach with backtracking. This will allow us to explore all possible permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the input numbers. This ensures that we consider every possible order of the numbers.\n2. Use a recursive function to try all combinations of operations between the numbers.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n4. If a valid expression is found, return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression based on the current permutation of numbers and operations\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\ndef find_expression(nums):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for num_perm in permutations(nums):\n        for ops in permutations(operations, 3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == 24:\n                return f\"<<<({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}{num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}>>>\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [2, 2, 2, 12]\n\n# Find and print the expression\nprint(find_expression(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. If a solution is found, it will be printed in the required format. If no solution is found, it will indicate that as well."

    "The current solution uses a straightforward approach with basic arithmetic operations, but it lacks the complexity needed for symbolic computing and efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that explores different combinations of operations and numbers. You can use techniques such as backtracking or recursive functions to systematically try different permutations and combinations of the numbers and operations. This will help ensure that all possible solutions are considered, and the correct one is found. Aim to generate code that can handle a variety of inputs and find the solution dynamically, rather than hardcoding a specific answer."
