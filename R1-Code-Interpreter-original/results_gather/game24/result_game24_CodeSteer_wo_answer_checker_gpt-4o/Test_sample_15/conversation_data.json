    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We should test different permutations of the numbers to find a valid equation.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 5, 5, 11, and 12.\n- Calculate: ((5 * 5) - (12 - 11)) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to demonstrate this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 5, 5, 11, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = ((a * b) - (d - c))\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<((5 * 5) - (12 - 11)) = {result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more robust solution that can handle a wider range of inputs, we can implement a recursive function that systematically tries different combinations of numbers and operations. This approach will allow us to explore all possible ways to combine the numbers using the basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value of 24.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a recursive function to try all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Use parentheses to change the order of operations and explore different groupings.\n4. Check if any combination results in the target value of 24.\n5. Return the first valid equation found.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression with the given numbers and operations\n    try:\n        # Try different parenthesizations\n        expr1 = f\"(({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]}))\"\n        expr2 = f\"(({nums[0]} {ops[0]} ({nums[1]} {ops[1]} {nums[2]})) {ops[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        expr3 = f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} (({nums[1]} {ops[1]} {nums[2]}) {ops[2]} {nums[3]}))\"\n        expr4 = f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} ({nums[1]} {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]})))\"\n        expr5 = f\"(({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} {nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        \n        for expr in [expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4, expr5]:\n            if eval(expr) == 24:\n                return expr\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # Try all permutations of the numbers\n    for nums in permutations(numbers):\n        # Try all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product(\"+-*/\", repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Input numbers\nnumbers = [5, 5, 11, 12]\n\n# Find and print the expression that evaluates to 24\nsolution = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses permutations to try all possible orders of the numbers and uses the `product` function to try all combinations of the operations. It evaluates different parenthesizations to find a valid expression that results in 24."

    "The current solution is correct for the given input, but the approach lacks complexity and does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that can handle a wider range of inputs and find solutions more efficiently. You could explore using recursive functions or backtracking to systematically try different combinations of numbers and operations. This will help in generating a more robust solution that can be applied to similar problems with different inputs."
