    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 5, 9, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Start by adding 12 and 9 to get 21.\n- Then, add 5 to 21 to get 26.\n- Finally, subtract 2 from 26 to get 24.\n\nThis gives us the equation: (12 + 9 + 5 - 2) = 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 2, 5, 9, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = (d + c + b - a)\n\n# Print the final equation and result\nprint(f\"<<<({d} + {c} + {b} - {a}) = {result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the equation and the result in the specified format.",
    "To create a more comprehensive solution that explores all possible combinations of operations and groupings, we can use a recursive approach. This approach will systematically try different combinations of numbers and operations to find a valid equation that results in 24. We can use Python's `itertools` to generate permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations, and then evaluate each possible expression.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers to account for different orders.\n2. Generate all combinations of operations (+, -, *, /) for the three operations needed.\n3. Use a recursive function to evaluate all possible groupings of the numbers and operations.\n4. Check if any of these combinations result in 24.\n5. Use Python's `eval` function to evaluate the expressions dynamically.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Try different groupings of the numbers and operations\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\",\n        f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\",\n        f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        try:\n            if eval(expr) == 24:\n                return expr\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_for_24(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if expr:\n                return expr\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [2, 5, 9, 12]\nsolution = find_expression_for_24(numbers)\nprint(f\"<<<{solution} = 24>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, checking each possible grouping to see if it results in 24. If a valid expression is found, it will be printed in the specified format."

    "The current solution is correct in terms of achieving the desired result, but it lacks complexity and does not explore all possible combinations of operations and groupings. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically tries different combinations of operations and groupings to ensure that all possibilities are explored. This could involve using recursive functions or backtracking to find a valid equation that results in 24. Additionally, consider using symbolic computing libraries like SymPy to handle the expression building and evaluation more effectively."
