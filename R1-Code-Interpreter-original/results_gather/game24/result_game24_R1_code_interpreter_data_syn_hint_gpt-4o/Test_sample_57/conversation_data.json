    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 11 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to increase the value to reach 24.\n2. We can try multiplying two of the 2s together, which gives us 4. Then, we can multiply this result by the third 2, giving us 8.\n3. Now, we have 8 and 11 left. Adding these two numbers gives us 19, which is not 24.\n4. Let's try a different approach: multiply 11 by 2, which gives us 22. Then, we can add the remaining two 2s to reach 24.\n\nThe equation that satisfies the condition is: (11 * 2) + 2 + 2 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (11 * 2) + 2 + 2 = 24 <<<answer>>>"
