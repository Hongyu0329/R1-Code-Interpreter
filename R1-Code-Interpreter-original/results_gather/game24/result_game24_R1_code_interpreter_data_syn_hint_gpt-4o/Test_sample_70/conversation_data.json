    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 4 to obtain 24, we need to consider different combinations of arithmetic operations and groupings. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try multiplying the numbers together, but 2 * 2 * 2 * 4 = 32, which is too high.\n2. We can try adding and multiplying in different orders, such as (2 + 2) * (2 + 4) = 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nThis combination works because:\n- We first add two of the 2s to get 4.\n- Then, we add the remaining 2 to 4 to get 6.\n- Finally, we multiply 4 by 6 to get 24.\n\nThus, the expression that uses each number exactly once and results in 24 is:\n\n(2 + 2) * (2 + 4) = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
