    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 8, 9, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try addition and subtraction to see if we can balance the numbers to reach 24.\n2. Multiplication and division can be used to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start by adding two numbers and see if the remaining numbers can be combined to reach 24.\n- Try multiplying two numbers and see if the remaining numbers can be adjusted to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few calculations manually:\n\n- If we multiply 8 and 3, we get 24. So, we need to see if we can form 3 using the remaining numbers 9, 11, and 12.\n- If we try (12 - 9), we get 3. So, we can use this to form 24.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n- Multiply 8 by (12 - 9) to get 24.\n\nThe expression is: \\( 8 \\times (12 - 9) = 24 \\).\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 8 * (12 - 9) = 24 <<<answer>>>"
