    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 12, and 12 to form the number 24 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers. Since we have two 12s, we can try to use them in a way that simplifies the equation.\n\n2. One potential approach is to use multiplication and division to simplify the numbers. For example, multiplying or dividing by 12 can help us reach closer to 24.\n\n3. We can also consider using addition and subtraction to adjust the values.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24, but we need to use all numbers.\n- If we add 3 and 8, we get 11, which doesn't directly help us reach 24.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- Consider using one of the 12s as a divisor or multiplier to adjust the other numbers.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- Use one 12 to divide or multiply the result of an operation involving the other numbers.\n\nAfter some trial and error, we find that:\n\n- ((12 / 12) + 3) * 8 = 24\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<((12 / 12) + 3) * 8 = 24>>>"
