    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 7, 7, 11, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value.\n2. Consider using division to reduce larger numbers if needed.\n3. We can also use subtraction to adjust the total to 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition:\n  - \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\), and then add 3 to get 24. But we don't have a 3 directly.\n  - \\( 12 - 7 = 5 \\), and then \\( 5 \\times 7 = 35 \\), which is too large.\n  - \\( 11 + 7 = 18 \\), and then \\( 18 + 6 = 24 \\), but we don't have a 6 directly.\n\n- Consider using division:\n  - \\( 12 / 6 = 2 \\), but we don't have a 6 directly.\n  - \\( 11 - 7 = 4 \\), and then \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\), but we don't have a 6 directly.\n\n- Try using subtraction and addition:\n  - \\( 12 - 11 = 1 \\), and then \\( 1 + 23 = 24 \\), but we don't have a 23 directly.\n\nLet's try a different approach by using a combination of operations:\n\n- \\( 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\)\n- \\( 49 - 11 = 38 \\)\n- \\( 38 - 12 = 26 \\), which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- \\( 12 - 7 = 5 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times 7 = 35 \\)\n- \\( 35 - 11 = 24 \\)\n\nThis combination works. Let's verify:\n\n- \\( 12 - 7 = 5 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times 7 = 35 \\)\n- \\( 35 - 11 = 24 \\)\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<answer>>>((12 - 7) * 7 - 11) = 24<<<answer>>>"
