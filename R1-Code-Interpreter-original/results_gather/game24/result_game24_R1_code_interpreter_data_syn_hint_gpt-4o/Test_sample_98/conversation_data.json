    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try using addition and multiplication:\n   - (3 + 5) * 3 = 24, but we have two 5s and a 12 to use.\n   \n2. We can try using subtraction and addition:\n   - 12 - 5 = 7, and 7 + 5 = 12, but this doesn't help us reach 24.\n\n3. We can try using division:\n   - 12 / 3 = 4, and 4 * 5 = 20, but this doesn't reach 24.\n\n4. We can try using a combination of operations:\n   - (5 * 5) - (12 - 3) = 25 - 9 = 16, which is not 24.\n\n5. Let's try another combination:\n   - (5 * 5) - (3 + 12) = 25 - 15 = 10, which is not 24.\n\n6. Let's try using division and addition:\n   - (12 / (5 - 3)) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11, which is not 24.\n\n7. Let's try using multiplication and addition:\n   - (5 * 3) + (12 - 5) = 15 + 7 = 22, which is not 24.\n\n8. Let's try using a different approach:\n   - (5 * 5) - (12 / 3) = 25 - 4 = 21, which is not 24.\n\n9. Let's try using a combination of operations:\n   - (12 - 5) * (5 - 3) = 7 * 2 = 14, which is not 24.\n\n10. Let's try using a different combination:\n    - (5 + 5) * (12 / 3) = 10 * 4 = 40, which is not 24.\n\n11. Let's try using a different approach:\n    - (12 - 5) + (5 * 3) = 7 + 15 = 22, which is not 24.\n\n12. Let's try using a different combination:\n    - (5 * 3) + (12 - 5) = 15 + 7 = 22, which is not 24.\n\n13. Let's try using a different approach:\n    - (5 * 3) - (12 - 5) = 15 - 7 = 8, which is not 24.\n\n14. Let's try using a different combination:\n    - (5 + 5) * (12 / 3) = 10 * 4 = 40, which is not 24.\n\n15.
