    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 3, 9, and 9 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try using multiplication and addition:\n   - (3 * 9) + (3 * 1) = 27 + 3 = 30 (too high)\n   - (3 * 8) = 24 (but we don't have 8)\n\n2. We can try using division:\n   - 9 / 3 = 3, then 3 * 3 = 9, and 9 + 9 = 18 (too low)\n   - 9 / 3 = 3, then 3 + 9 = 12, and 12 * 2 = 24 (but we don't have 2)\n\n3. We can try using subtraction:\n   - 9 - 3 = 6, then 6 * 3 = 18, and 18 + 6 = 24 (but we don't have 6)\n\n4. We can try using a combination of operations:\n   - (9 - 3) = 6, then 6 * 3 = 18, and 18 + 6 = 24 (but we don't have 6)\n\nAfter trying several combinations, let's try a different approach:\n\n- We can use the numbers to form a division and multiplication:\n  - (9 / 3) = 3, then 3 * 3 = 9, and 9 * 3 = 27 (too high)\n  - (9 / 3) = 3, then 3 * 9 = 27, and 27 - 3 = 24\n\nThis combination works. Let's verify:\n\n- (9 / 3) = 3\n- 3 * 9 = 27\n- 27 - 3 = 24\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (9 / 3) * 9 - 3 = 24 <<<answer>>>"
