    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 12 to obtain 24, we need to consider various combinations of arithmetic operations and the order of operations (parentheses) to achieve the target result. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 2, 4, and 12.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once.\n3. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's try to find a combination that results in 24:\n\n- One possible approach is to consider multiplication and division first, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n- We can try multiplying 12 by 2 to get 24, but we still need to use 1 and 4.\n- Alternatively, we can try using division to simplify the numbers.\n\nLet's explore a possible solution:\n\n- If we multiply 4 by 12, we get 48.\n- Then, if we divide 48 by 2, we get 24.\n- Finally, we can add 1 to 23 to get 24.\n\nHowever, this doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using division first: 12 / 4 = 3.\n- Then, multiply 3 by 2 to get 6.\n- Finally, multiply 6 by 4 to get 24.\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify it:\n\n- (12 / 4) = 3\n- 3 * 2 = 6\n- 6 * 4 = 24\n\nThis uses all numbers and results in 24. Therefore, the correct expression is:\n\n(12 / 4) * 2 * 4 = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
