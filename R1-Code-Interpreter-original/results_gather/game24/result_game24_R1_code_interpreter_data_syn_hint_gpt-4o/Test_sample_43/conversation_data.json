    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 1, 4, 7, and 8 to obtain 24, we need to consider various combinations of arithmetic operations and the order of operations (parentheses) to achieve the target result. \n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try using addition and multiplication, as these operations can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n2. We can also consider subtraction and division, but they might be less straightforward given the numbers we have.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, which is too high, so this doesn't work directly.\n- Try using addition and multiplication: (1 + 7) * 4 = 32, which is also too high.\n- Try using subtraction: 8 - 4 = 4, then 4 * 7 = 28, which is too high.\n- Try using division: 8 / 4 = 2, then 2 * 7 = 14, which is too low.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using 8 and 1 together: 8 + 1 = 9\n- Then, use 9 and 4: 9 * 4 = 36, which is too high.\n- Try using subtraction: 8 - 1 = 7, then 7 * 4 = 28, which is too high.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- Use 8 and 4: 8 * 4 = 32\n- Subtract 7: 32 - 7 = 25, which is close but not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Use 8 and 7: 8 + 7 = 15\n- Then, use 15 and 4: 15 + 4 = 19, which is too low.\n- Try using multiplication: 15 * 1 = 15, which is too low.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- Use 8 and 4: 8 * 4 = 32\n- Subtract 1: 32 - 1 = 31, which is too high.\n- Subtract 7: 31 - 7 = 24, which is correct.\n\nThe correct combination is: (8 * 4) - 7 - 1 = 24\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (8 * 4) - 7 - 1 = 24 <<<answer>>>"
