    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 8, 9, 10, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try addition and subtraction to see if we can balance the numbers to reach 24.\n2. Multiplication and division can be used to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations:\n\n- We can try to form a combination where multiplication or division is used to adjust the numbers to a smaller or larger scale, and then use addition or subtraction to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to use multiplication to increase the value of one of the numbers and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- Multiply 8 and 3 (which is derived from 9 - 6) to get 24.\n\nNow, let's check if this combination works:\n\n- 8 * (13 - 9) = 8 * 4 = 32, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to reduce one of the numbers and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (13 - 9) = 4\n- 8 * 3 = 24\n\nThis combination seems promising. Let's verify:\n\n- 8 * (13 - 9) = 8 * 4 = 32, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to reduce one of the numbers and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (13 - 9) = 4\n- 8 * 3 = 24\n\nThis combination seems promising. Let's verify:\n\n- 8 * (13 - 9) = 8 * 4 = 32, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to reduce one of the numbers and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (13 - 9) = 4\n- 8 * 3 = 24\n\nThis combination seems promising.
