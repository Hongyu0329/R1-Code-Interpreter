    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 5, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of operations that will yield 24:\n\n1. Consider the numbers and possible operations:\n   - We can try addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n   - We need to use all four numbers exactly once.\n\n2. Start by testing combinations:\n   - We can try multiplying two numbers and then using the result with the other numbers.\n   - We can also try adding or subtracting numbers to see if we can reach 24.\n\n3. Let's test a few combinations manually:\n   - If we multiply 4 and 5, we get 20. Then, adding 11 gives us 31, which is too high.\n   - If we multiply 5 and 12, we get 60. This is too high to work with.\n   - If we multiply 4 and 12, we get 48. This is also too high.\n\n4. Let's try a different approach:\n   - If we add 11 and 5, we get 16.\n   - Then, if we add 4, we get 20.\n   - Finally, if we add 12, we get 32, which is too high.\n\n5. Let's try using division:\n   - If we divide 12 by 4, we get 3.\n   - Then, if we multiply 3 by 5, we get 15.\n   - Finally, if we add 11, we get 26, which is too high.\n\n6. Let's try another combination:\n   - If we add 11 and 12, we get 23.\n   - Then, if we add 5, we get 28.\n   - Finally, if we subtract 4, we get 24.\n\nThis combination works. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n(11 + 12 + 5 - 4) = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(11 + 12 + 5 - 4)>>>"
