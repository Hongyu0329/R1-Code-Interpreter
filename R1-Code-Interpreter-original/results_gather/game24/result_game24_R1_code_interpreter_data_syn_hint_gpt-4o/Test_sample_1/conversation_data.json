    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. Since 12 is half of 24, we can consider multiplying 12 by 2. However, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, and 2 to achieve this.\n3. We can use the two 1s to form a multiplication factor of 2 by adding them: 1 + 1 = 2.\n4. Now, we can multiply 12 by this factor: 12 * (1 + 1) = 24.\n\nThis approach uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nThe equation is: 12 * (1 + 1) = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 12 * (1 + 1) = 24 <<<answer>>>"
