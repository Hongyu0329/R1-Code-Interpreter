    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 4, 5, and 5 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value to 24.\n2. Consider using multiplication first, as it can help reach larger numbers quickly.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 5 and 5, we get 25, which is close to 24. We can then try to adjust this by using the remaining numbers 4 and 4.\n- We can subtract 1 from 25 to get 24. To achieve this, we can use the remaining numbers 4 and 4 as follows: (4/4) = 1.\n\nThus, the equation can be formed as:\n(5 * 5) - (4 / 4) = 24\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (5 * 5) - (4 / 4) = 24 <<<answer>>>"
