    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 7, 7, and 7 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are likely to help us reach 24.\n2. Since we have three 7s, we can try multiplying two of them: \\(7 \\times 7 = 49\\).\n3. Now, we have 49 and 4 left. We need to use the remaining 7 and 4 to adjust the result to 24.\n4. We can try subtracting 4 from 49: \\(49 - 4 = 45\\).\n5. Now, we have 45 and need to use the remaining 7 to reach 24.\n6. We can divide 45 by 7, but it doesn't give us an integer result.\n7. Let's try a different approach: use addition and multiplication differently.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication first: \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\).\n2. Now, we have 28 and two 7s left.\n3. Subtract one 7 from 28: \\(28 - 7 = 21\\).\n4. Add the remaining 7: \\(21 + 7 = 28\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work either. Let's try again:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication and division: \\(7 \\times 7 = 49\\).\n2. Divide 49 by 7: \\(49 / 7 = 7\\).\n3. Now, we have 7 and 4 left.\n4. Add 4 to 7: \\(7 + 4 = 11\\).\n\nThis approach also doesn't work. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication: \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\).\n2. Subtract 7: \\(28 - 7 = 21\\).\n3. Add the remaining 7: \\(21 + 7 = 28\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work either. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication: \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\).\n2.
