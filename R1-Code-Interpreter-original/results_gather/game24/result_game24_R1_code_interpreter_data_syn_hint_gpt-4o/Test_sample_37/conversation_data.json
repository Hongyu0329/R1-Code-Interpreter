    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 8, and 9 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust using addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication: 6 * 4 = 24. We need to form 4 using the remaining numbers 1, 8, and 9.\n- Consider using division to form 4: 8 / 2 = 4. We can form 2 using 1 and 9: (9 - 1) = 8.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n- (9 - 1) = 8\n- 8 / 2 = 4\n- 6 * 4 = 24\n\nThis gives us the equation: 6 * ((9 - 1) / 2) = 24.\n\nLet's verify this with a code snippet to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 6, 8, 9\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = b * ((d - a) / (c / 2))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm the result. If the result is 24, we have found the correct equation. If not, we need to re-evaluate our approach.",

Consider using addition and subtraction to form intermediate results that can be multiplied or divided to reach 24.\n2. Explore different combinations of operations to see if we can achieve the target.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- Start with addition: 8 + 9 = 17\n- We need to form 7 using the remaining numbers 1 and 6.\n- Consider using subtraction: 6 - 1 = 5\n- Now, we can try to adjust the operations to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a new equation: (8 + 9) + (6 - 1) = 24.\n\nLet's verify this with a code snippet to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 6, 8, 9\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = (c + d) + (b - a)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm the result.
