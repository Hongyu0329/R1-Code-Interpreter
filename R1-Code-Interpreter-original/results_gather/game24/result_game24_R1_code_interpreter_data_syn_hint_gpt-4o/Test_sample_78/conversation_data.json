    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 6, 6, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We have two 6s, which can be useful for multiplication or division.\n3. The number 12 is relatively large, so it might be beneficial to use it in a division or subtraction to balance the equation.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 6, we get 36. Subtracting 12 from 36 gives us 24, but we still need to use the number 3.\n- If we divide 12 by 6, we get 2. We can then multiply this result by 6 to get 12, and add 3 to get 15, which is not 24.\n- If we try adding 6 and 12, we get 18. We can then add 6 to get 24, but we still need to use the number 3.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- We can start by adding 6 and 6 to get 12.\n- Then, add 12 to this result to get 24.\n- Finally, we need to incorporate the number 3. We can do this by subtracting 3 from 24 and then adding it back, but this doesn't work directly.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can multiply 6 by 3 to get 18.\n- Then, add 6 to get 24.\n- Finally, we need to incorporate the number 12. We can do this by subtracting 12 from 24 and then adding it back, but this doesn't work directly.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can multiply 6 by 3 to get 18.\n- Then, add 6 to get 24.\n- Finally, we need to incorporate the number 12.
