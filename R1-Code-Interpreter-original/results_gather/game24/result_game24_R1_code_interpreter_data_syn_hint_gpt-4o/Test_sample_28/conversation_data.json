    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 8 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We have two 8s, which can be useful for multiplication or division.\n3. We can try multiplying 8 by 3 to get 24, but we don't have a 3 directly. However, we can form 3 by using the other numbers.\n\nLet's explore the possibility of forming 3 using the numbers 4 and 6:\n\n- We can use the expression (6 - 4) to get 2.\n- Then, we can use the expression (8 / 8) to get 1.\n- Adding these results, we get 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nNow, we can multiply this result by 8 to get 24:\n\n- 8 * (6 - 4 + 8 / 8) = 24\n\nLet's verify this with a code snippet to ensure the calculation is correct:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 4, 6, 8, 8\n\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = d * (b - a + c / d)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm if the result is indeed 24.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the expression \\(8 \\times (6 - 4 + \\frac{8}{8})\\) indeed equals 24. This means the solution is correct.\n\nThe expression uses all the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 8 exactly once, and the operations are valid. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'((8 * (6 - 4 + 8 / 8)) = 24'>>>"
