    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 6, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of operations that will yield 24:\n\n1. We can start by considering the multiplication and addition operations, as they can quickly increase the value.\n2. We have two 6s, which can be useful for multiplication.\n3. We can try multiplying 6 and 4, which gives us 24, but we still need to use the other numbers.\n4. Let's try using the numbers in a different order or with different operations.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 4 to get 24.\n- We still need to use the other 6 and 8.\n- We can try subtracting 6 from 8 to get 2.\n- Then, we can add this result to 24.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation:\n\n- (6 * 4) = 24\n- (8 - 6) = 2\n- 24 + 2 = 26\n\nThis approach doesn't work because it results in 26, not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 4 to get 24.\n- Subtract 6 from 8 to get 2.\n- Subtract 2 from 24 to get 22.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 4 to get 24.\n- Subtract 8 from 6 to get -2.\n- Add -2 to 24 to get 22.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 4 to get 24.\n- Add 6 to 8 to get 14.\n- Subtract 14 from 24 to get 10.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.
