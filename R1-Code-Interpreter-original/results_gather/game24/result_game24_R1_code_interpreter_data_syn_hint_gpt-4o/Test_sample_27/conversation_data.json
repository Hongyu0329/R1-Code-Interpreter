    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We have three 13s and one 11. We can try to combine the 13s in a way that simplifies the problem.\n2. We can try to use multiplication and division to adjust the values, as these operations can significantly change the numbers.\n3. We can also consider using addition and subtraction to reach the target number.\n\nLet's explore some combinations:\n\n- We can try to multiply two 13s and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n- We can also try to add or subtract the numbers in different orders.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. \\( 13 + 13 = 26 \\)\n2. \\( 26 - 11 = 15 \\)\n3. \\( 15 + 13 = 28 \\) (This doesn't work)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. \\( 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\)\n2. \\( 26 - 13 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( 13 - 11 = 2 \\) (This doesn't work)\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n1. \\( 13 / 13 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( 1 + 13 = 14 \\)\n3. \\( 14 + 11 = 25 \\) (This doesn't work)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. \\( 13 + 13 = 26 \\)\n2. \\( 26 - 13 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( 13 - 11 = 2 \\) (This doesn't work)\n\nLet's try using multiplication:\n\n1. \\( 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\)\n2. \\( 26 - 11 = 15 \\)\n3. \\( 15 - 13 = 2 \\) (This doesn't work)\n\nAfter trying several combinations, it seems challenging to reach exactly 24 with these numbers using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try a different approach:\n\n1. \\( 13 + 13 = 26 \\)\n2. \\( 26 - 11 = 15 \\)\n3. \\( 15 + 13 = 28 \\) (This doesn't work)\n\nLet's try using division and multiplication:\n\n1. \\( 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\)\n2. \\( 26 - 13 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( 13 - 11 = 2 \\) (This doesn't work)\n\nAfter exploring various combinations, it seems that there is no straightforward way to achieve exactly 24 using the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations. Therefore, it might be that there is no valid solution for this particular set of numbers.\n\n<<<answer>>>No valid solution using the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13 to achieve 24 with basic arithmetic operations."
