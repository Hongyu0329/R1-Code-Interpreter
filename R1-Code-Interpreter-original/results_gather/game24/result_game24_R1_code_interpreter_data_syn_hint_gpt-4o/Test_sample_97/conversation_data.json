    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 3, 4, and 5 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n2. Consider using multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n- Use the other 3 and 5: \\(12 + 3 + 5 = 20\\) (not 24)\n- Try another combination: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n- Use the other 3 and 4: \\(15 + 3 + 4 = 22\\) (not 24)\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- Multiply 4 and 5: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n- Add the two 3s: \\(3 + 3 = 6\\)\n- Add the results: \\(20 + 6 = 26\\) (not 24)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 3 and 4: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n- Multiply the result by 2 (using the two 3s): \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\)\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify:\n\n- Use one 3 to multiply with 4: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n- Use the other 3 to multiply with 5: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n- Add the results: \\(12 + 15 = 27\\) (not 24)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 3 and 5: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n- Add 4: \\(15 + 4 = 19\\)\n- Add the remaining 3: \\(19 + 3 = 22\\) (not 24)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n- Multiply 3 and 4: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n- Multiply the result by 2 (using the two 3s): \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\)\n\nThis approach seems to work.
