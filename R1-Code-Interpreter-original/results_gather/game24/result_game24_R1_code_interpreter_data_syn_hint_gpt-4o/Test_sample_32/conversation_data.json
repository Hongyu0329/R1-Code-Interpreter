    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 1, 2, 11, and 11 to make 24, we need to consider various combinations of arithmetic operations and the order of operations (parentheses) to achieve the target number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 2, 11, 11.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once.\n3. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's try to find a combination that results in 24:\n\n- We can start by considering the larger numbers, 11 and 11, and see how they can be combined with the smaller numbers, 1 and 2.\n- One possible approach is to try to form intermediate results that can be easily manipulated to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication and addition:\n   - (11 + 11) = 22\n   - 22 + 2 = 24\n   - 24 * 1 = 24\n\nThis combination works because we can use the numbers in the following way:\n- Add the two 11s to get 22.\n- Add 2 to 22 to get 24.\n- Multiply by 1 to maintain the result as 24.\n\nThus, the expression that uses all numbers and results in 24 is:\n(11 + 11) + 2 * 1 = 24\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(11 + 11) + 2 * 1 = 24>>>"
