    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 5 to obtain 24, we need to consider different combinations of arithmetic operations and groupings. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try using addition and multiplication, as these operations can help increase the value quickly.\n2. We can also consider using subtraction and division, but we need to be careful with division to avoid non-integer results.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to use multiplication to increase the value of 5, and then adjust with addition or subtraction using the other numbers.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- Multiply 5 by 5 to get 25.\n- Subtract 1 to get 24.\n\nThis can be expressed as: (5 * 5) - 1 = 24\n\nNow, let's verify if this uses all the numbers:\n\n- We used both 5s and one 1. We need to use the second 1 as well.\n\nLet's adjust the expression to ensure all numbers are used:\n\n- We can use the second 1 in a way that doesn't change the result, such as adding and then subtracting it.\n\nThe final expression can be: (5 * 5) - (1 - 1) = 24\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<(5 * 5) - (1 - 1)>>>"
