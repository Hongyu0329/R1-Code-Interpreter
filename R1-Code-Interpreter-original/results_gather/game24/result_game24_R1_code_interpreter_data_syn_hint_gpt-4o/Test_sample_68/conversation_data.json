    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 6, 8, 10, and 12 to obtain 24, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers. We have addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try multiplication and division first, as they can quickly change the magnitude of the numbers.\n\n- Consider using multiplication to combine two numbers and then adjust with the others.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 4 (which is 12/3) to get 24.\n\nNow, let's verify this with a step-by-step calculation:\n\n- 12 / 3 = 4\n- 6 * 4 = 24\n\nThis combination uses all the numbers and results in 24. Therefore, the expression is:\n\n((12 / (10 - 8)) * 6) = 24\n\nThis uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\n<<<answer>>>((12 / (10 - 8)) * 6) = 24<<<answer>>>"
