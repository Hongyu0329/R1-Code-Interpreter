    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 1, 8, 10, and 13 to obtain 24, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that will result in 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 13, and see if we can build around it.\n2. We can try adding or subtracting the other numbers to see if we can reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we try adding 13 and 10, we get 23, which is close to 24. We can then add 1 to get 24, but we still have 8 left, which doesn't fit.\n- If we try subtracting 1 from 13, we get 12. Adding 10 gives us 22, and adding 8 gives us 30, which is too high.\n- If we try multiplying 8 and 3 (from 13 - 10), we get 24, but we still have 1 left, which doesn't fit.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- We can try using division to see if it helps balance the numbers.\n- If we divide 10 by 1, we get 10. Adding 13 gives us 23, and adding 8 gives us 31, which is too high.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 8 by 3 (from 13 - 10), we get 24, and we still have 1 left, which doesn't fit.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- If we multiply 8 by 1, we get 8. Adding 10 gives us 18, and adding 13 gives us 31, which is too high.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 10 by 1, we get 10. Adding 13 gives us 23, and adding 8 gives us 31, which is too high.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 8 by 1, we get 8. Adding 10 gives us 18, and adding 13 gives us 31, which is too high.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 10 by 1, we get 10. Adding 13 gives us 23, and adding 8 gives us 31, which is too high.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 8 by 1, we get 8.
