    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 11 to make 24, we need to consider different combinations and operations. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 11, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. We can try multiplying 11 by 2 to get 22, and then see if we can add the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n3. Alternatively, we can try different operations like addition, subtraction, or division to see if they help us reach the target.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 11 by 2, we get 22. Adding 1 and 1 gives us 24: (11 * 2) + 1 + 1 = 24.\n- We can also try other combinations, but this seems to be the most straightforward solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n(11 * 2) + 1 + 1 = 24\n\nThis uses each number exactly once and achieves the target of 24.\n\n<<<answer>>> (11 * 2) + 1 + 1 = 24 <<<answer>>>"
