    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 9, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- We can try using multiplication and addition:\n  - (12 * 2) = 24, but we don't have a 2.\n  - (12 + 12) = 24, but we still need to use 1 and 9.\n\n- We can try using division and addition:\n  - (12 / 1) = 12, but this doesn't help us reach 24.\n\n- We can try using subtraction and addition:\n  - (12 + 12) = 24, but we still need to use 1 and 9.\n\n- We can try using a combination of operations:\n  - (12 - 9) = 3, and then (3 * 8) = 24, but we don't have an 8.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- We can try using multiplication and subtraction:\n  - (12 * 1) = 12, and then (12 + 12) = 24, but we still need to use 9.\n\n- We can try using division and multiplication:\n  - (12 / 12) = 1, and then (1 * 24) = 24, but we don't have a 24.\n\nLet's try using a combination of operations with parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n- We can try using addition and subtraction:\n  - ((12 + 12) - (9 - 1)) = 24\n\nThis combination uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the equation is: ((12 + 12) - (9 - 1)) = 24\n\n<<<((12 + 12) - (9 - 1)) = 24>>>"
