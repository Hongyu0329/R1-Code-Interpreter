    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 10, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. We can try to form a combination that involves multiplication or addition to reach a number close to 24, then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we add 10 and 13, we get 23, which is close to 24. We can then add 2/2 to reach 24.\n- Alternatively, we can try multiplying or dividing to see if we can reach 24.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation:\n\n- (10 + 13) = 23\n- 23 + (2/2) = 24\n\nThis combination works. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n(10 + 13) + (2/2) = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(10 + 13) + (2/2)>>>"
