    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 10, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's try to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. We can try to form a combination where we use multiplication or addition to reach a number close to 24, and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 5 and 5, we get 25, which is close to 24. We can then try to adjust this by using subtraction with the other numbers.\n- Alternatively, we can try to use 10 and 13 in a way that gets us close to 24, and then adjust with the 5s.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with 10 + 13 = 23\n- We need to add 1 to reach 24. We can achieve this by using the two 5s: (5/5) = 1\n\nSo, the equation can be:\n\n(10 + 13) + (5/5) = 24\n\nThis uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\n<<<answer>>>((10 + 13) + (5/5)) = 24<<<answer>>>"
