    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 9 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We have two 9s, which can be useful for multiplication or division.\n3. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 9 and 3, we get 27. We can then subtract 6 to get 21, and add the remaining 9 to get 30, which is too high.\n- If we multiply 9 and 6, we get 54. Dividing by 9 gives us 6, and adding 3 gives us 9, which is too low.\n- If we multiply 6 and 3, we get 18. Adding 9 gives us 27, and subtracting the remaining 9 gives us 18, which is too low.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- We can try using division to reduce the numbers:\n  - Divide 9 by 9 to get 1.\n  - Multiply 6 by 3 to get 18.\n  - Add 18 and 1 to get 19, which is too low.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 3 and 9 to get 27.\n- Subtract 9 to get 18.\n- Add 6 to get 24.\n\nThis seems to work. Let's verify:\n\n- (3 * 9) = 27\n- 27 - 9 = 18\n- 18 + 6 = 24\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (3 * 9) - 9 + 6 = 24 <<<answer>>>"
