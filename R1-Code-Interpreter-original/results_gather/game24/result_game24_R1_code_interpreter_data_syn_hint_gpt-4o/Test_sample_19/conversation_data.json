    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 4, 11, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try addition and subtraction to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We can also try multiplication and division to see if they help in reaching the target.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations:\n\n- We can try adding 11 and 13 to get 24, but we still need to use the two 4s.\n- We can try multiplying or dividing the numbers to see if they can help us reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we add 11 and 13, we get 24, but we still need to use the two 4s.\n- If we multiply 4 and 4, we get 16, and then we can add 11 and subtract 13, but that doesn't work.\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n- If we divide 4 by 4, we get 1. Then we can add 11 and 13 to get 25, but we need 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 4 by 11, we get 44. Then we can subtract 13 and 4, but that doesn't work.\n\nLet's try using a combination of operations:\n\n- If we multiply 4 by 4, we get 16. Then we can add 11 to get 27, and subtract 13 to get 14, which doesn't work.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 4 by 11, we get 44. Then we can subtract 13 to get 31, and subtract 4 to get 27, which doesn't work.\n\nLet's try using division and multiplication:\n\n- If we divide 11 by 4, we get 2.75, which doesn't help.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 4 by 4, we get 16. Then we can add 11 to get 27, and subtract 13 to get 14, which doesn't work.\n\nLet's try using a combination of operations:\n\n- If we multiply 4 by 11, we get 44.
