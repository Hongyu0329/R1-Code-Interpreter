    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 7, 10, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing these numbers in different ways.\n2. We need to consider the order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction).\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start by adding 10 and 12 to get 22.\n- Then, add 1 to 22 to get 23.\n- Finally, add 7 to 23 to get 30, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 1 from 10 to get 9.\n- Add 12 to 9 to get 21.\n- Add 7 to 21 to get 28, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Add 10 and 12 to get 22.\n- Subtract 7 from 22 to get 15.\n- Add 1 to 15 to get 16, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Add 1 and 7 to get 8.\n- Add 10 to 8 to get 18.\n- Add 12 to 18 to get 30, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Add 1 and 12 to get 13.\n- Add 10 to 13 to get 23.\n- Add 7 to 23 to get 30, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 1 from 12 to get 11.\n- Add 10 to 11 to get 21.\n- Add 7 to 21 to get 28, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 7 from 12 to get 5.\n- Add 10 to 5 to get 15.\n- Add 1 to 15 to get 16, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 10 from 12 to get 2.\n- Add 1 to 2 to get 3.\n- Multiply 3 by 7 to get 21, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 1 from 7 to get 6.\n- Add 10 to 6 to get 16.\n- Add 12 to 16 to get 28, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 7 from 10 to get 3.\n- Add 1 to 3 to get 4.\n- Multiply 4 by 12 to get 48, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 1 from 10 to get 9.\n- Add 7 to 9 to get 16.\n- Add 12
