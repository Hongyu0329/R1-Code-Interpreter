    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n2. Consider using multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication: 6 * 5 = 30. This is too high, so let's try another approach.\n- Try using addition and multiplication: (6 + 9) = 15, then 15 + 5 = 20, and finally 20 + 1 = 21. This is close but not 24.\n- Try another combination: (9 - 5) = 4, then 4 * 6 = 24. This uses all numbers and results in 24.\n\nThe correct combination is: (9 - 5) * 6 = 24.\n\nThus, the expression that uses all numbers exactly once to get 24 is:\n\n(9 - 5) * 6 = 24\n\n<<<answer>>>"
