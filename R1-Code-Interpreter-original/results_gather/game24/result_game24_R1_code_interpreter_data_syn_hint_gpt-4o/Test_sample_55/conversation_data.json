    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 10, 10, and 10 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try to use multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24.\n2. Since we have three 10s, we can consider using them in a way that simplifies the equation, such as combining them through addition or subtraction.\n3. We can also consider using division to reduce the numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we add two 10s, we get 20. We can then add 6 to get 26, and subtract the remaining 10 to get 16, which is not 24.\n- If we multiply two 10s, we get 100, which is too large to work with directly.\n- If we divide 10 by 10, we get 1, which might be useful in simplifying the equation.\n\nLet's try using division and multiplication:\n\n- Divide one 10 by another 10 to get 1.\n- Multiply 6 by 10 to get 60.\n- Subtract 1 from 60 to get 59, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 by 10 to get 60.\n- Subtract 10 to get 50.\n- Subtract another 10 to get 40.\n- Divide by the remaining 10 to get 4, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- Multiply 6 by 10 to get 60.\n- Divide 60 by 10 to get 6.\n- Add the remaining 10 to get 16, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try using subtraction and division:\n\n- Subtract 10 from 10 to get 0.\n- Add 6 to get 6.\n- Multiply by the remaining 10 to get 60, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try using addition and division:\n\n- Add 10 and 10 to get 20.\n- Add 6 to get 26.\n- Subtract the remaining 10 to get 16, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try using multiplication and division:\n\n- Multiply 6 by 10 to get 60.\n- Divide by 10 to get 6.\n- Add the remaining 10 to get 16, which is not 24.\n\nAfter trying several combinations, it seems challenging to reach 24 with these numbers using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try a different approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 by 10 to get 60.\n- Subtract 10 to get 50.\n- Divide by the remaining 10 to get 5, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try using subtraction and multiplication:\n\n- Subtract 10 from 10 to get 0.\n- Add 6 to get 6.\n- Multiply by the remaining 10 to get 60, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try using addition and multiplication:\n\n- Add 10 and 10 to get 20.\n- Add 6 to get 26.\n- Subtract the remaining 10 to get 16, which is not 24.\n\nAfter exploring various combinations, it seems that reaching 24 with these numbers is not straightforward.
