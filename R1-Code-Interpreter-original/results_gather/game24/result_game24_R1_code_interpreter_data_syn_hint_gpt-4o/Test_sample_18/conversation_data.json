    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 3, 7, 8, and 8 to obtain 24, we need to consider various combinations of arithmetic operations and the order of operations (parentheses) to achieve the target result. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the multiplication of two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 24.\n2. We can also consider addition and subtraction combinations to see if they can be used effectively.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 8 and 3, we get 24, but we still have 7 and 8 left, which need to be used.\n- If we multiply 8 and 8, we get 64, which is too large.\n- If we multiply 7 and 3, we get 21, which is close to 24. We can then try to use the remaining 8 to reach 24.\n\nLet's try the combination of multiplying 7 and 3, and then adding the remaining numbers:\n\n- \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\)\n- \\(21 + 8 - 8 = 21\\) (This doesn't work)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- If we add 8 and 8, we get 16.\n- We can then add 7 to get 23, and finally add 1 (by subtracting 3 from 4) to reach 24.\n\nLet's verify this approach:\n\n- \\(8 + 8 = 16\\)\n- \\(16 + 7 = 23\\)\n- \\(23 + (4 - 3) = 24\\)\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's write it in a clear mathematical expression:\n\n\\[\n(8 + 8) + 7 + (4 - 3) = 24\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 8, and 8 exactly once. Let's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 3 and 8, we get 24.\n- We can then subtract 8 and add 8 to maintain the result.\n\nLet's verify this approach:\n\n- \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n- \\(24 - 8 + 8 = 24\\)\n\nThis approach doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- If we multiply 3 and 8, we get 24.\n- We can then subtract 7 and add 7 to maintain the result.\n\nLet's verify this approach:\n\n- \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n- \\(24 - 7 + 7 = 24\\)\n\nThis approach doesn't use all numbers correctly.
