    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 6, 6, and 7 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n2. We have two 6s, which can be useful for multiplication.\n3. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 6, we get 36. This is too high, but we can try to adjust it.\n- If we multiply 6 and 3, we get 18. Adding 6 gives us 24, but we still have 7 left, which doesn't fit.\n- If we multiply 6 and 7, we get 42. This is too high, but we can try to adjust it.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- We can try to use division to reduce the numbers.\n- If we divide 6 by 6, we get 1. This might help in adjusting the total.\n\nLet's try to form an equation:\n\n- Start with 6 * 3 = 18.\n- Add 6 to get 24.\n- We still have 7 left, which doesn't fit.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Start with 6 * 7 = 42.\n- Subtract 18 (which is 6 * 3) to get 24.\n\nThis seems to work. Let's verify:\n\n- 6 * 7 = 42\n- 6 * 3 = 18\n- 42 - 18 = 24\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n(6 * 7) - (6 * 3) = 24\n\n<<<answer>>>((6 * 7) - (6 * 3)) = 24<<<answer>>>"
