    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try adding and subtracting combinations to see if they can be simplified to 24.\n2. We can also try multiplying and dividing combinations to see if they can be simplified to 24.\n\nLet's start by considering different operations:\n\n- Try adding two numbers and subtracting the others.\n- Try multiplying two numbers and adding or subtracting the others.\n- Try dividing two numbers and adding or subtracting the others.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. \\( (3 + 11) = 14 \\), then \\( 14 + 8 = 22 \\), and \\( 22 + 12 = 34 \\) (not 24).\n2. \\( (12 - 8) = 4 \\), then \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\), and \\( 12 + 11 = 23 \\) (not 24).\n3. \\( (12 \\times 2) = 24 \\), but we don't have a 2.\n4. \\( (11 + 3) = 14 \\), then \\( 14 + 8 = 22 \\), and \\( 22 + 12 = 34 \\) (not 24).\n5. \\( (12 - 3) = 9 \\), then \\( 9 + 11 = 20 \\), and \\( 20 + 8 = 28 \\) (not 24).\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- Consider using division to simplify the numbers.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- \\( (12 / 3) = 4 \\), then \\( 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\), and \\( 32 - 11 = 21 \\) (not 24).\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- \\( (8 \\times 3) = 24 \\), then \\( 24 - 12 = 12 \\), and \\( 12 + 11 = 23 \\) (not 24).\n\nLet's try:\n\n- \\( (11 - 3) = 8 \\), then \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\), and \\( 24 - 12 = 12 \\) (not 24).\n\nLet's try:\n\n- \\( (12 - 8) = 4 \\), then \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\), and \\( 12 + 11 = 23 \\) (not 24).\n\nLet's try:\n\n- \\( (12 - 11) = 1 \\), then \\( 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\), and \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\).\n\nThis combination works:\n\n- \\( (12 - 11) = 1 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\)\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is:\n\n\\[\n((12 - 11) \\times 8) \\times 3 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
