    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 13, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers. We have addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. Since we have two 13s, we can consider using them in a way that simplifies the equation. For example, multiplying or adding them might be useful.\n\n3. Let's try to form an equation step by step:\n\n   - Consider using multiplication to increase the value quickly. For example, 13 * 2 = 26, which is close to 24.\n   - We can then try to adjust the result by using subtraction or division.\n\n4. Let's try a few combinations:\n\n   - If we multiply 13 by 2, we get 26. We can then subtract 6 to get 20, and add 4 to get 24.\n   - Alternatively, we can try other combinations, but this seems promising.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation:\n\n- Start with 13 * 2 = 26\n- Subtract 6: 26 - 6 = 20\n- Add 4: 20 + 4 = 24\n\nThis combination works. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n((13 * 2) - 6) + 4 = 24\n\nNow, let's format the final answer:\n\n<<<((13 * 2) - 6) + 4 = 24>>>"
