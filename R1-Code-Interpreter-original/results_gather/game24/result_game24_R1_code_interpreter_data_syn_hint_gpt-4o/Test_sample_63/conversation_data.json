    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 8, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of operations that will yield 24:\n\n1. Consider using addition and multiplication, as they can quickly increase the value.\n2. We can try to form intermediate results that are easy to manipulate into 24.\n\nLet's explore the possibilities:\n\n- Start by adding the two 2s: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\).\n- Multiply the result by 8: \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\).\n- Subtract 12 from 32: \\(32 - 12 = 20\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't yield 24, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 2 and 12: \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n- Now, we need to use the remaining numbers 2 and 8 in a way that doesn't change the result.\n- We can add 8 and subtract 8: \\((2 \\times 12) + (8 - 8) = 24 + 0 = 24\\).\n\nThis approach works, but let's see if there's a more straightforward way:\n\n- Multiply 2 and 12: \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n- Use the remaining numbers 2 and 8 in a way that doesn't affect the result: \\((2 \\times 12) + (2 - 2) = 24 + 0 = 24\\).\n\nThis is a valid solution. Let's present it in the required format:\n\n\\[\n(2 \\times 12) + (2 - 2) = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (2 * 12) + (2 - 2) = 24 <<<answer>>>"
