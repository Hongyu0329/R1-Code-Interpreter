    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 7, 9, 11, and 11 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try using addition and subtraction to balance the numbers.\n2. Multiplication and division can be used to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start by considering the use of multiplication and addition:\n  - (11 - 9) = 2\n  - 2 * 11 = 22\n  - 22 + 7 = 29 (not 24)\n\n- Try another approach:\n  - 11 + 11 = 22\n  - 22 - 9 = 13\n  - 13 + 7 = 20 (not 24)\n\n- Another attempt:\n  - 11 * 2 = 22\n  - 22 + 2 = 24\n\nLet's verify this with the numbers:\n\n- Use 11, 11, 9, and 7:\n  - (11 - 9) = 2\n  - 2 * 11 = 22\n  - 22 + 2 = 24\n\nThis approach seems to work. Let's finalize the answer.\n\n<<<(11 - 9) * 11 + 2 = 24>>>"
