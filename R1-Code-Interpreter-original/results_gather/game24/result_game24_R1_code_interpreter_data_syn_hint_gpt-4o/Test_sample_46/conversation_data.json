    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 12 to form an equation that results in 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication and addition:\n   - We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n   - For example, if we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24. Then, we need to use 1 and 3 in a way that doesn't change the result.\n\n2. Consider using division:\n   - We can divide 12 by 1 to get 12, but this doesn't help us reach 24.\n   - Dividing 12 by 2 gives us 6, which might be useful if combined with other operations.\n\n3. Consider using subtraction:\n   - Subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones might help balance the equation.\n\nLet's try a combination that seems promising:\n\n- Multiply 12 by 2 to get 24.\n- Use 1 and 3 in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as adding them and then subtracting the sum from itself.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n- (12 * 2) = 24\n- (1 + 3) = 4\n- 24 - 4 + 4 = 24\n\nHowever, this doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 12 by 2 to get 24.\n- Use 1 and 3 in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as adding them and then subtracting the sum from itself.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n- (12 * 2) = 24\n- (1 + 3) = 4\n- 24 - 4 + 4 = 24\n\nHowever, this doesn't use all numbers correctly.
