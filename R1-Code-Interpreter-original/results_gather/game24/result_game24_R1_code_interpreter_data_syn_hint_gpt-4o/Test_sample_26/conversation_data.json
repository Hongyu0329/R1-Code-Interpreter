    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 4, 6, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust using addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 4, we get 24, but we still need to use 1 and 12.\n- If we multiply 12 and 2 (by using 1+1), we get 24, but we still need to use 4 and 6.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using 12 and 6: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\) (using 1+1 for 2).\n- Now, we need to incorporate 4. We can use it in a subtraction or addition.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- \\( (12 \\times 2) - (6 - 4) = 24 \\)\n\nThis doesn't work as it doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using 12 and 6: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\) (using 1+1 for 2).\n- Now, we need to incorporate 4. We can use it in a subtraction or addition.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- \\( (12 \\times 2) - (6 - 4) = 24 \\)\n\nThis doesn't work as it doesn't use all numbers correctly.
