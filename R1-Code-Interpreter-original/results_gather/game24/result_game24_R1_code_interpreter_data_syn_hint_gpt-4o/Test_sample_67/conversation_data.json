    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 7 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n2. Consider using multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication: 5 * 7 = 35\n- We need to reduce 35 to 24, which is a difference of 11.\n- We have the numbers 1 and 2 left. We can use subtraction: 35 - (2 * 5) = 35 - 10 = 25\n- We are still 1 away from 24, so let's adjust our approach.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition: (7 * 2) + (5 * 1) = 14 + 5 = 19\n- We need to add 5 to reach 24, but we have already used 5.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- Use multiplication: (7 * 5) = 35\n- Subtract: 35 - (2 * 5) = 35 - 10 = 25\n- We are still 1 away from 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition: (7 * 2) + (5 * 1) = 14 + 5 = 19\n- We need to add 5 to reach 24, but we have already used 5.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- Use multiplication: (7 * 5) = 35\n- Subtract: 35 - (2 * 5) = 35 - 10 = 25\n- We are still 1 away from 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition: (7 * 2) + (5 * 1) = 14 + 5 = 19\n- We need to add 5 to reach 24, but we have already used 5.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- Use multiplication: (7 * 5) = 35\n- Subtract: 35 -
