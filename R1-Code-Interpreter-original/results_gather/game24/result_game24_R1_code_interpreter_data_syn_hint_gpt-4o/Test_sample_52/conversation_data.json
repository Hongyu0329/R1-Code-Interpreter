    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 5, 9, and 9 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try using multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24.\n2. Since we have two 9s, we can consider using them in multiplication or addition to reach a higher number.\n3. We can also consider using division to reduce the numbers if needed.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication of 9 and 9, which gives 81. This is too high, so we need to adjust.\n- Consider using 4 and 5 in multiplication: 4 * 5 = 20. We need to add 4 more to reach 24.\n- We can use one of the 9s to add to 20, but we need to adjust the operations to use all numbers.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- Use one 9 and 5 in multiplication: 9 * 5 = 45.\n- Subtract 9 from 45: 45 - 9 = 36.\n- Subtract 4 from 36: 36 - 4 = 32. This is not 24, so let's try another combination.\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n- Consider dividing 9 by 9, which gives 1.\n- Multiply 4 and 5: 4 * 5 = 20.\n- Add the result of 9/9 to 20: 20 + 1 = 21. This is not 24.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 4 and 5: 4 * 5 = 20.\n- Add 9 to 20: 20 + 9 = 29.\n- Subtract the other 9: 29 - 9 = 20. This is not 24.\n\nLet's try using a different combination:\n\n- Multiply 4 and 9: 4 * 9 = 36.\n- Subtract 5: 36 - 5 = 31.\n- Subtract the other 9: 31 - 9 = 22. This is not 24.\n\nLet's try using a different approach:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 4: 5 * 4 = 20.\n- Add 9: 20 + 9 = 29.\n- Subtract the other 9: 29 - 9 = 20. This is not 24.\n\nLet's try using a different approach:\n\n- Multiply 9 and 4: 9 * 4 = 36.\n- Subtract 5: 36 - 5 = 31.\n- Subtract the other 9: 31 - 9 = 22.
