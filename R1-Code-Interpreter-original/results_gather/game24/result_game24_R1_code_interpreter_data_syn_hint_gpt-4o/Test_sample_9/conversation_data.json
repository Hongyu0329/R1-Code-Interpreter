    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 2, 2, 3, and 8 to obtain 24, we need to consider various combinations of arithmetic operations and groupings. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers like 24.\n2. We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n3. We can also consider using division if it helps in reaching the target.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 8 by 3, we get 24. However, we still need to use the two 2s.\n- We can try using the two 2s to adjust the result of 8 * 3.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- Multiply 8 by 3 to get 24.\n- Use the two 2s in a way that doesn't change the result of 24.\n\nOne possible way is:\n\n- (8 * 3) = 24\n- (2 / 2) = 1\n- 24 * 1 = 24\n\nThis way, we have used all numbers exactly once and reached the target of 24.\n\nTherefore, the expression that uses all numbers and results in 24 is:\n\n(8 * 3) * (2 / 2) = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (8 * 3) * (2 / 2) = 24 <<<answer>>>"
