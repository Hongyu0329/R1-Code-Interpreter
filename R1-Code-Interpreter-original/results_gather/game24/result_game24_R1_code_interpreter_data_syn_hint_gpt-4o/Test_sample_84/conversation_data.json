    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to use addition and subtraction to balance the numbers.\n2. Multiplication and division can help in scaling the numbers up or down.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations:\n\n- We can try to add or subtract numbers to get closer to 24.\n- Multiplication can be used to increase the value quickly.\n- Division can help in reducing the value if needed.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start with the largest number, 13, and see how we can use the others to reach 24.\n- Consider using multiplication to increase the value of smaller numbers.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n1. Use multiplication to combine two numbers.\n2. Use addition or subtraction to adjust the result to 24.\n\nLet's try the combination:\n\n- Multiply 9 and 2 to get 18.\n- Add 9 to 18 to get 27.\n- Subtract 13 from 27 to get 14.\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 9 and 2 to get 18.\n- Add 13 to 18 to get 31.\n- Subtract 9 from 31 to get 22.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 9 and 2 to get 18.\n- Add 9 to 18 to get 27.\n- Subtract 13 from 27 to get 14.\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 9 and 2 to get
