    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 7, and 8 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition:\n   - If we multiply two numbers and then add or subtract the others, we might reach 24.\n   - For example, multiplying 5 and 5 gives 25, which is close to 24. We can then try to adjust by using 7 and 8.\n\n2. Another approach is to use division to simplify the numbers:\n   - Dividing 8 by 4 gives 2, which might be useful in forming 24 when combined with other operations.\n\n3. We can also try combinations of addition and subtraction:\n   - Adding 5 and 7 gives 12, and adding 5 and 8 gives 13. These sums can be used in further operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- One possible solution is to use the numbers in the following way:\n  - Multiply 5 and 5 to get 25.\n  - Subtract 7 from 25 to get 18.\n  - Add 8 to 18 to get 26.\n  - Subtract 2 (from dividing 8 by 4) to get 24.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 8 to get 40.\n- Subtract 7 to get 33.\n- Subtract 5 to get 28.\n- Subtract 4 (from dividing 8 by 2) to get 24.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 5 to get 25.\n- Subtract 8 to get 17.\n- Add 7 to get 24.\n\nThis approach uses all numbers correctly and results in 24.\n\nLet's verify this with a code query:\n\n```python\n# Using the numbers 5, 5, 7, and 8 to form 24\nresult = (5 * 5) - 8 + 7\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm if the solution is correct.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the solution is correct. The equation \\((5 \\times 5) - 8 + 7\\) indeed equals 24, and it uses all the numbers 5, 5, 7, and 8 exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
