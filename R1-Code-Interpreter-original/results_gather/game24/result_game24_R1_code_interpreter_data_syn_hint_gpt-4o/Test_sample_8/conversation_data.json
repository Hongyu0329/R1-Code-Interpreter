    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 11, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. We can try multiplying 12 by 2, but we don't have a 2 directly. However, we can create 2 by adding the two 1s: 1 + 1 = 2.\n3. So, we can try: 12 * (1 + 1) = 24.\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n12 * (1 + 1) = 24\n\n<<<answer>>>12 * (1 + 1) = 24<<<answer>>>"
