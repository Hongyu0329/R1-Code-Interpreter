    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 11, 11, and 11 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We have three 11s and one 2. A potential approach is to use multiplication and addition to reach 24.\n2. Consider using multiplication to increase the value quickly, as 11 is a relatively large number.\n3. We can try multiplying two 11s and then adjust the result using the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\)\n- \\(22 + 11 = 33\\)\n- \\(33 - 11 = 22\\) (This doesn't work)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- \\(11 + 11 = 22\\)\n- \\(22 + 2 = 24\\) (This works, but we haven't used the third 11)\n\nWe need to ensure all numbers are used. Let's try:\n\n- \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\)\n- \\(22 + 11 = 33\\)\n- \\(33 - 11 = 22\\) (This doesn't work)\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- \\(11 + 11 = 22\\)\n- \\(22 + 2 = 24\\) (This works, but we need to use all numbers)\n\nLet's try:\n\n- \\(11 + 11 = 22\\)\n- \\(22 + 2 = 24\\)\n- We can use the third 11 in a way that doesn't change the result, such as:\n  - \\((11 + 11) + (2 - 11) = 24\\)\n\nThis equation uses all numbers and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n\\[\n(11 + 11) + (2 - 11) = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
