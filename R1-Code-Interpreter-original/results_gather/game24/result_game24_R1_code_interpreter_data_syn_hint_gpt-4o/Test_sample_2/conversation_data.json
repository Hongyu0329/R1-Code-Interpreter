    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We have two 1s, which are neutral in multiplication and division, so they might be used in addition or subtraction to adjust the result.\n3. The number 8 is relatively large, so it might be useful in multiplication or as a base for addition.\n\nLet's try to form an equation:\n\n- If we multiply 8 by 3, we get 24. We can form 3 by using the numbers 1, 1, and 2.\n- One way to form 3 is by adding 2 and 1, and then adding the other 1: (2 + 1) + 1 = 3.\n\nThus, we can construct the equation as follows:\n\n(8 * ((2 + 1) + 1)) = 24\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\n<<<answer>>> (8 * ((2 + 1) + 1)) = 24 <<<answer>>>"
