    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 6, 6, 10, and 13 to obtain 24, we need to consider various arithmetic operations and combinations. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 6, 6, 10, and 13.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n\nWe can start by considering different combinations and operations:\n\n- We can try adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing these numbers in various ways.\n- We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication and addition:\n   - (6 * 6) = 36\n   - 36 - 10 = 26\n   - 26 - 13 = 13 (doesn't work)\n\n2. Consider using division and addition:\n   - (13 - 10) = 3\n   - 6 / 6 = 1\n   - 3 + 1 = 4 (doesn't work)\n\n3. Consider using a combination of operations:\n   - (6 * 10) = 60\n   - 60 / 6 = 10\n   - 10 + 13 = 23 (close, but not 24)\n\n4. Try another combination:\n   - (13 - 10) = 3\n   - 6 * 3 = 18\n   - 18 + 6 = 24\n\nThis combination works. Let's verify:\n\n- Subtract 10 from 13 to get 3.\n- Multiply 6 by 3 to get 18.\n- Add the remaining 6 to 18 to get 24.\n\nThis satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once and reaching the target number 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n(13 - 10) * 6 + 6 = 24\n\n<<<answer>>>((13 - 10) * 6 + 6) = 24<<<answer>>>"
