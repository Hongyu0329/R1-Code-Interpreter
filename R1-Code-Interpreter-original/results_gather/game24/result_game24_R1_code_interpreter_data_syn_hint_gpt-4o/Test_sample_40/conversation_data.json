    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 5, 6, 12, and 13 to obtain 24, we need to explore different combinations of arithmetic operations. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nLet's try to break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 5, 6, 12, and 13.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try multiplication and addition/subtraction to see if we can reach 24.\n- We can start by considering multiplication of two numbers and then adjust with the others.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 6 to get 30.\n- Subtract 12 from 30 to get 18.\n- Add 13 to 18 to get 31, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5 to get 30.\n- Subtract 13 from 30 to get 17.\n- Add 12 to 17 to get 29, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5 to get 30.\n- Subtract 12 from 30 to get 18.\n- Add 13 to 18 to get 31, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 12 and 2 to get 24.\n- Add 5 to 24 to get 29, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5 to get 30.\n- Subtract 12 from 30 to get 18.\n- Add 13 to 18 to get 31, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5 to get 30.\n- Subtract 12 from 30 to get 18.\n- Add 13 to 18 to get 31, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 6 and 5
