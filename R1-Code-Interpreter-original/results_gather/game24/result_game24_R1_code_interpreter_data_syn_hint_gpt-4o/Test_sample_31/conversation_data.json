    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 3, 8, 10, and 11 to obtain 24, we need to explore different combinations of arithmetic operations. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nLet's start by considering different combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try adding and subtracting numbers to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We can also try multiplying and dividing numbers to see if that helps us reach the target.\n\nLet's explore some possibilities:\n\n- Start with addition and subtraction:\n  - (3 + 8 + 10 + 11) = 32, which is too high.\n  - (11 + 10) = 21, and (21 + 3) = 24, but we still have 8 left, so this doesn't work.\n\n- Try multiplication and division:\n  - (3 * 8) = 24, but we still have 10 and 11 left, so this doesn't work.\n\n- Try a combination of operations:\n  - (11 - 3) = 8, and (8 * 3) = 24, but we still have 10 left, so this doesn't work.\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - (11 + 3) = 14, and (14 + 10) = 24, but we still have 8 left, so this doesn't work.\n\nLet's try a different approach by using a combination of operations:\n\n- Consider using division and multiplication:\n  - (11 - 8) = 3, and (3 * 8) = 24, but we still have 10 left, so this doesn't work.\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - (10 - 8) = 2, and (11 - 3) = 8, then (2 * 8) = 16, which is not 24.\n\nAfter trying several combinations, let's try a systematic approach using code to explore all possible combinations of operations and numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [3, 8, 10, 11]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                    return None\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code execution result provided two valid expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 3, 8, 10, and 11. Both expressions are:\n\n1. \\((11 - 10) \\times 3 \\times 8\\)\n2. \\((11 - 10) \\times 8 \\times 3\\)\n\nBoth expressions are mathematically equivalent and correctly use each number exactly once to achieve the target of 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
