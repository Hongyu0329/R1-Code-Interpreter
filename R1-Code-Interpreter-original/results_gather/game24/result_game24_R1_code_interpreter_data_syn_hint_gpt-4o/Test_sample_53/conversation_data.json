    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 6, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try to use multiplication and addition to reach 24. For example, multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n2. We can also consider using division to simplify the numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication: 6 * 6 = 36\n- Subtract 13: 36 - 13 = 23\n- Add 1: 23 + 1 = 24\n\nThis combination works. Let's verify:\n\n- ((6 * 6) - 13) + 1 = 24\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<((6 * 6) - 13) + 1>>>"
