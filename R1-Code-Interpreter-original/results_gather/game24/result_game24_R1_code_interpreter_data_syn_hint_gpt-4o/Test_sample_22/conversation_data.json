    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 6, and 11 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 11, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. We have two 6s, which can be useful for multiplication or addition.\n3. The number 1 can be used to adjust the result slightly if needed.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 6, we get 36. Subtracting 11 from 36 gives us 25, which is close to 24. We can then subtract 1 to reach 24.\n- Alternatively, we can try adding 11 and 6 to get 17, and then see if we can use the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\nLet's test these ideas with a code script to find a valid equation:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 6, 6, 11]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct equation.",
    "The code generated multiple expressions, but none of them evaluated to 24. Let's try a different approach by focusing on a more systematic way to explore possible combinations and operations.\n\nWe need to find a combination of operations and numbers that will result in 24. Let's consider the following approach:\n\n1. Use permutations to try different orders of the numbers.\n2. Use combinations of operations to apply between the numbers.\n3. Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 24.\n\nLet's refine the code to ensure it evaluates the expressions correctly and efficiently:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 6, 6, 11]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Evaluate the expression in the order of operations\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                    return None\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this refined code to find the correct equation.",
    "The previous attempts did not yield the correct result.

Therefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (6 * 6) - 11 - 1 = 24 <<<answer>>>"
