    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try addition and subtraction to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We can also try multiplication and division to see if they help in reaching the target.\n\nLet's start by considering different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try combining numbers to get intermediate results that can be easily manipulated to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we add 11 and 12, we get 23, which is close to 24. We can then try to add 1 more to reach 24.\n- We can use the remaining numbers, 3 and 7, to see if they can be combined to make 1.\n\nLet's try the combination:\n\n- (11 + 12) = 23\n- (7 - 3) = 4\n- 23 + 1 = 24\n\nNow, let's see if we can use the numbers 3 and 7 to make 1:\n\n- (7 - 3) = 4\n- 4 / 4 = 1\n\nNow, we can add this 1 to 23 to get 24:\n\n- 23 + 1 = 24\n\nThus, the expression is:\n\n((11 + 12) + ((7 - 3) / 4)) = 24\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and achieves the target of 24.\n\n<<<answer>>>((11 + 12) + ((7 - 3) / 4)) = 24<<<answer>>>"
