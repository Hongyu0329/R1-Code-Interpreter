    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 3, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's start by considering different combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try using addition and multiplication first, as they are straightforward operations that can quickly increase the value.\n2. We can also consider using division, especially since we have two 12s, which might simplify the equation.\n\nLet's explore a few possibilities:\n\n- If we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24, but we still need to use the other numbers.\n- If we add 12 and 12, we get 24, but again, we need to use the other numbers.\n- We can try using division to simplify the numbers.\n\nLet's try a combination that might work:\n\n- Start with the two 12s: \\(12 / 12 = 1\\).\n- Add 2 to the result: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\).\n- Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n- Finally, multiply by 2: \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\).\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the two 12s to form a base: \\(12 + 12 = 24\\).\n- We need to incorporate the 2 and 3 in a way that doesn't change the result.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- \\(12 + 12 = 24\\).\n- \\(24 - (3 - 2) = 24\\).\n\nThis equation uses all numbers and results in 24. Let's verify this:\n\n- \\(3 - 2 = 1\\).\n- \\(24 - 1 = 23\\).\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to simplify: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\).\n- Multiply by 2: \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n- Add the remaining 12: \\(8 + 12 = 20\\).\n\nThis still doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division: \\(12 / 2 = 6\\).\n- Multiply by 3: \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\).\n- Add the remaining 12: \\(18 + 12 = 30\\).\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\).\n- Multiply by 6: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\nThis works, but we need to use all numbers.
