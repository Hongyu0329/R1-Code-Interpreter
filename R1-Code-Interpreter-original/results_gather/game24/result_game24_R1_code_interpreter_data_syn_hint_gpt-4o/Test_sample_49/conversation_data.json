    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 8, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n2. Consider using multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24, as these operations can quickly increase or decrease the result.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication: 8 * 3 = 24. We need to form 3 using the numbers 1, 5, and 9.\n- We can form 3 by: (9 - 5 - 1) = 3.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n- (8 * (9 - 5 - 1)) = 24\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the expression that gives us 24 is:\n\n(8 * (9 - 5 - 1)) = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
