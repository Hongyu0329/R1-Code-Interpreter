    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 10, 13, 13, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's start by considering possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We have three 13s and one 10. We can try to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to reach 24.\n2. Since 13 is a large number, we might consider using subtraction or division to reduce its impact.\n3. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- We can start by adding two 13s: 13 + 13 = 26.\n- Then, subtract 10: 26 - 10 = 16.\n- Finally, add the remaining 13: 16 + 13 = 29, which is too high.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Start with 13 + 13 = 26.\n- Subtract the remaining 13: 26 - 13 = 13.\n- Add 10: 13 + 10 = 23, which is still not 24.\n\nLet's try using multiplication:\n\n- Multiply two 13s: 13 * 13 = 169, which is too high.\n- Try dividing: 13 / 13 = 1.\n- Add 10: 1 + 10 = 11.\n- Add the remaining 13: 11 + 13 = 24.\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify it:\n\n- (13 / 13) = 1\n- 1 + 10 = 11\n- 11 + 13 = 24\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n(13 / 13) + 10 + 13 = 24\n\n<<<answer>>>"
