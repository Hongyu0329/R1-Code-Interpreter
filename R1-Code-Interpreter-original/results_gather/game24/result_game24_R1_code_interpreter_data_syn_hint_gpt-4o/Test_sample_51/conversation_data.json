    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 8, 10, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try addition and multiplication first, as they can quickly increase the value:\n   - Adding all numbers: 2 + 8 + 10 + 11 = 31, which is too high.\n   - Multiplying two numbers and adding the others: \n     - (2 * 11) + 8 + 10 = 22 + 8 + 10 = 40, which is too high.\n     - (8 * 2) + 10 + 11 = 16 + 10 + 11 = 37, which is too high.\n     - (10 * 2) + 8 + 11 = 20 + 8 + 11 = 39, which is too high.\n\n2. Let's try using subtraction to reduce the total:\n   - (11 - 8) = 3, then try to use 2 and 10 to reach 24:\n     - 3 * 10 = 30, which is too high.\n     - 3 + 10 = 13, which is too low.\n   - (10 - 8) = 2, then try to use 2 and 11 to reach 24:\n     - 2 * 11 = 22, which is close but not 24.\n     - 2 + 11 = 13, which is too low.\n\n3. Let's try using division:\n   - (10 / 2) = 5, then try to use 8 and 11 to reach 24:\n     - 5 + 8 + 11 = 24, which is exactly what we need.\n\nThus, the correct combination is:\n- (10 / 2) + 8 + 11 = 24\n\nThis uses each number exactly once and achieves the desired result.\n\n<<<answer>>>((10/2) + 8 + 11) = 24<<<answer>>>"
