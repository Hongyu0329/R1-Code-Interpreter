    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 9 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We have two 9s, which can be useful for multiplication or division.\n3. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 9 and 3, we get 27. Then, subtracting 7 gives us 20, which is not 24.\n- If we multiply 9 and 7, we get 63. This is too large, so we need to divide or subtract.\n- If we divide 9 by 3, we get 3. Then, multiplying by 7 gives us 21, which is close to 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 9 by 3 to get 27.\n- Subtract 9 to get 18.\n- Add 7 to get 25, which is still not 24.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- Multiply 9 by 9 to get 81.\n- Divide by 3 to get 27.\n- Subtract 7 to get 20, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try using division first:\n\n- Divide 9 by 9 to get 1.\n- Add 3 to get 4.\n- Multiply by 7 to get 28, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 3 by 9 to get 27.\n- Subtract 7 to get 20.\n- Add 9 to get 29, which is too large.\n\nLet's try using addition and subtraction:\n\n- Add 9 and 9 to get 18.\n- Add 3 to get 21.\n- Add 7 to get 28, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 3 from 9 to get 6.\n- Multiply by 7 to get 42, which is too large.\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n- Divide 9 by 3 to get 3.\n- Multiply by 7 to get 21.\n- Add 9 to get 30, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 7 from 9 to get 2.\n- Multiply by 9 to get 18.\n- Add 3 to get 21, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 3 from 9 to get 6.\n- Multiply by 9 to get 54, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 9 from 9 to get 0.\n- Add 3 to get 3.\n- Multiply by 7 to get 21, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 3 from 9 to get 6.\n- Add 9 to get 15.\n- Add 7 to get 22, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Subtract 7 from 9 to get 2.\n- Multiply by 9 to get 18.\n- Add 3 to get 21, which is not 24.\n\nLet's
