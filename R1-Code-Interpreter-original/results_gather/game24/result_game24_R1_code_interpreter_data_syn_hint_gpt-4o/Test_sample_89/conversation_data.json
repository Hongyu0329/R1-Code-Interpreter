    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 4, 11, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and then adjust using addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 3 and 4, we get 12. Then, if we add 12, we get 24. However, this doesn't use the number 11.\n- If we multiply 11 and 2, we get 22. Adding 4 gives us 26, which is too high.\n- If we multiply 12 and 2, we get 24, but this doesn't use the number 11.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- We can try to use division to adjust the numbers. For example, dividing 12 by 3 gives us 4, and then we can use the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can try: (12 / 3) = 4, then 4 * 4 = 16, and finally 16 + 11 - 3 = 24.\n\nThis doesn't seem to work, so let's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (11 - 3) = 8, then 8 * 3 = 24, and finally 24 + 4 - 4 = 24.\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify:\n\n- (11 - 3) = 8\n- 8 * 3 = 24\n- 24 + 4 - 4 = 24\n\nThis approach doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (12 - 4) = 8, then 8 * 3 = 24, and finally 24 + 11 - 11 = 24.\n\nThis approach also doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (12 - 11) = 1, then 1 * 3 = 3, and finally 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nThis approach doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (12 - 3) = 9, then 9 * 4 = 36, and finally 36 - 11 = 25.\n\nThis approach doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (12 - 4) = 8, then 8 * 3 = 24, and finally 24 + 11 - 11 = 24.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.
