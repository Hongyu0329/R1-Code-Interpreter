    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 12, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the operations that can easily reach 24, such as multiplication and division, since 24 is a relatively large number compared to the numbers we have.\n\n2. We have three 12s, which suggests that multiplication might be a useful operation. For example, multiplying two 12s gives us 144, which is too large, but dividing 144 by 12 gives us 12, which is still not 24.\n\n3. Let's try using addition and multiplication together. We can add two 12s to get 24, but we still have two more numbers to use.\n\n4. Consider using division to reduce the numbers. For example, dividing 12 by 12 gives us 1, which might be useful in combination with other operations.\n\n5. Let's try a combination of operations: \n   - Add two 12s to get 24.\n   - Use the remaining 12 and 2 to adjust the result.\n\n6. We can try: \n   - (12 + 12) = 24\n   - Use the remaining 12 and 2 to form a neutral operation, such as (12/12) = 1, and then multiply by 2 to maintain the result.\n\n7. This approach seems promising. Let's verify:\n\n   - (12 + 12) = 24\n   - (12 / 12) = 1\n   - 24 * 1 = 24\n\nThis satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once and reaching the result of 24.\n\nTherefore, the equation is: ((12 + 12) * (12 / 12)) = 24\n\n<<<answer>>>((12 + 12) * (12 / 12)) = 24<<<answer>>>"
