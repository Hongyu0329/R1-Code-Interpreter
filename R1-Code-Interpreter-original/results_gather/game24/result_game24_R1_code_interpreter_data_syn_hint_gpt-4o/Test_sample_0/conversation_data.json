    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 4, and 6 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers like 24.\n2. We can try multiplying the largest number, 6, with another number to get closer to 24.\n3. We can also consider using subtraction or division to adjust the result to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 6 by 4, we get 24. However, we still need to use the two 1s.\n- We can try adding the two 1s first: 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Now, we can multiply 6 by 4 to get 24, and then divide by the result of the addition: 24 / 2 = 12, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can multiply 6 by 4 to get 24.\n- We can then add the two 1s: 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Finally, we can add the result of the addition to 24: 24 + 2 = 26, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- We can multiply 6 by 4 to get 24.\n- We can then subtract the result of adding the two 1s: 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Finally, we can subtract 2 from 24: 24 - 2 = 22, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can multiply 6 by 4 to get 24.\n- We can then add the two 1s: 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Finally, we can subtract the result of the addition from 24: 24 - 2 = 22, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can multiply 6 by 4 to get 24.\n- We can then add the two 1s: 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Finally, we can add the result of the addition to 24: 24 + 2 = 26, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can multiply 6 by 4 to get 24.\n- We can then add the two 1s: 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Finally, we can subtract the result of the addition from 24: 24 -
