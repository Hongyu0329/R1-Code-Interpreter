    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 6 to obtain 24, we need to consider different combinations and operations. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding and multiplying numbers to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We can also consider using subtraction and division if needed.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations:\n\n- We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n- We can also try adding two numbers and then multiplying by another.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. \\( (5 + 5) \\times 3 - 6 = 24 \\)\n   - Here, we add the two 5s to get 10, multiply by 3 to get 30, and then subtract 6 to get 24.\n\nThis combination seems to work. Let's verify it with a simple calculation:\n\n```python\n# Calculation to verify the solution\nresult = (5 + 5) * 3 - 6\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm if the result is indeed 24. If it is, we have found our solution.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculation is correct, and the expression \\((5 + 5) \\times 3 - 6\\) indeed equals 24. Therefore, we have successfully used the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 6 to obtain the target number 24.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<'((5 + 5) * 3 - 6) = 24'>>>"
