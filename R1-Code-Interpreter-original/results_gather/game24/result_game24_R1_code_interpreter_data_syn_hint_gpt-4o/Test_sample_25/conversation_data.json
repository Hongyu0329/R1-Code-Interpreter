    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 12 to obtain 24, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n2. We can also consider subtraction and division to adjust the total to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 5, we get 30. Subtracting 12 gives us 18, and adding 6 gives us 24. But this doesn't use all numbers correctly.\n- If we multiply 6 and 5, we get 30. Subtracting 6 gives us 24, but we haven't used 12.\n- If we multiply 6 and 5, we get 30. Subtracting 12 gives us 18, and adding 6 gives us 24. But this doesn't use all numbers correctly.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using division to adjust the total:\n  - (6 * 5) = 30\n  - 30 - 12 = 18\n  - 18 + 6 = 24\n\nThis approach doesn't work as it doesn't use all numbers correctly.
