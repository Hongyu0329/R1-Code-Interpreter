    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 11, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try to use multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24.\n2. Consider using division to simplify the numbers, especially since we have two 5s, which might be useful for division.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition:\n  - \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\), which is close to 24, but we need to adjust it.\n  - \\(12 - 11 = 1\\), which can be used to adjust the result.\n\nCombining these, we can try:\n- \\((5 \\times 5) - (12 - 11) = 25 - 1 = 24\\)\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\\[\n(5 \\times 5) - (12 - 11) = 24\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<(5 * 5) - (12 - 11)>>>"
