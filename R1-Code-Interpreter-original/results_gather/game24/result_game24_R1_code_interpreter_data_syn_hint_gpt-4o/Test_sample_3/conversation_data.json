    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. Since 12 is half of 24, we can consider multiplying 12 by 2 to get 24. This uses one of the 2s.\n3. We are left with two 2s. We need to use them in a way that doesn't change the result of 24.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Multiply 12 by 2 to get 24.\n- Use the remaining two 2s in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as adding them and then subtracting them.\n\nThe equation can be structured as follows:\n\n\\[\n(12 \\times 2) + (2 - 2) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<(12 * 2) + (2 - 2) = 24>>>"
