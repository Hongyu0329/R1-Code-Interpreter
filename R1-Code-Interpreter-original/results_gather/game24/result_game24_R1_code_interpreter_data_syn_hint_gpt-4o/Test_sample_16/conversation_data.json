    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 7, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers. We have addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\n3. Since we have two 12s, we can consider using them in multiplication or addition to reach a higher number, which can then be adjusted with the other numbers.\n\n4. Let's try to use multiplication first, as it can quickly increase the value:\n   - 12 * 2 = 24, but we don't have a 2 directly. However, we can create a 2 by using division: 12 / 6 = 2.\n\n5. Now, let's see if we can use the numbers to form 24:\n   - (12 / 6) = 2\n   - 2 * 12 = 24\n\n6. We have used the numbers 12, 6, and 12. We still need to use the number 7.\n\n7. We can incorporate 7 by using it in a way that doesn't affect the final result:\n   - (12 / 6) = 2\n   - 2 * 12 = 24\n   - 24 + (7 - 7) = 24\n\nThis way, we have used all the numbers: 6, 7, 12, and 12, and the result is 24.\n\nTherefore, the equation is: ((12 / 6) * 12) + (7 - 7) = 24\n\n<<<answer>>>((12 / 6) * 12) + (7 - 7) = 24<<<answer>>>"
