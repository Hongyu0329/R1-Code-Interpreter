    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. We can start by adding two of the 13s: \\(13 + 13 = 26\\).\n2. Then, subtract 11 from 26: \\(26 - 11 = 15\\).\n3. Finally, add the remaining 13: \\(15 + 13 = 28\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't yield 24, so let's try another combination:\n\n1. Subtract 11 from one of the 13s: \\(13 - 11 = 2\\).\n2. Add the result to another 13: \\(2 + 13 = 15\\).\n3. Subtract the remaining 13: \\(15 - 13 = 2\\).\n\nThis approach also doesn't yield 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. Add two of the 13s: \\(13 + 13 = 26\\).\n2. Subtract the third 13: \\(26 - 13 = 13\\).\n3. Subtract 11: \\(13 - 11 = 2\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't yield 24 either. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. Add 11 and one of the 13s: \\(11 + 13 = 24\\).\n\nThis approach yields 24, but we haven't used all the numbers. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. Add 11 and one of the 13s: \\(11 + 13 = 24\\).\n2. Subtract the remaining 13: \\(24 - 13 = 11\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't yield 24 either. Let's try another combination:\n\n1.
