    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 6, 7, and 10, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that results in 24. Let's try to find such a combination:\n\n\\[\n(10 - 1) \\times (7 - 6) = 9 \\times 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(10 + 7) + (6 \\times 1) = 17 + 6 = 23\n\\]\n\nThis is close, but not quite 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n\\[\n(10 \\times 1) + (7 + 6) = 10 + 13 = 23\n\\]\n\nStill not 24. Let's try a different approach:\n\n\\[\n(10 + 6) + (7 - 1) = 16 + 6 = 22\n\\]\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(10 - 6) \\times (7 - 1) = 4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis works! The correct combination is:\n\n\\[\n(10 - 6) \\times (7 - 1) = 24\n\\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n<<<(10 - 6) * (7 - 1)>>>"
