    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 4, 5, 9, and 9, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Let's try to find a solution:\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\n\\[\n(9 - 5) \\times (9 - 4) = 4 \\times 5 = 20\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't give us 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(9 + 9) + (5 - 4) = 18 + 1 = 19\n\\]\n\nThis also doesn't work.
