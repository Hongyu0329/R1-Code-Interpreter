    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 2, 6, 6, and 8, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. Start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers.\n2. Try different combinations and operations to see if they result in 24.\n\nLet's calculate: \n\n\\[\n(6 \\times 6) - (8 + 2) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis uses each number exactly once and results in 24. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<((6*6)-(8+2))>>>"
