    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 2, 12, 12, and 12, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n\\[\n(12 / 12) + (12 \\times 2) = 1 + 24 = 25\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(12 - 12) + (12 \\times 2) = 0 + 24 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis works. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n\\[\n(12 - 12) + (12 \\times 2) = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(12 - 12) + (12 * 2)>>>"
