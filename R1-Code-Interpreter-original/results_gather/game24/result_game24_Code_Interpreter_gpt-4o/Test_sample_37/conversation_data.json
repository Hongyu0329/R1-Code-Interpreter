    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 6, 8, and 9, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that result in 24. Let's try different combinations and operations to achieve this.\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\n\\[\n(9 - 1) \\times (8 - 6) = 24\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n\\[\n(9 - 1) = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n(8 - 6) = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n8 \\times 2 = 16\n\\]\n\nIt seems I made a mistake in my calculation. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(6 \\times 8) - (9 + 1) = 24\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 8 = 48\n\\]\n\\[\n9 + 1 = 10\n\\]\n\\[\n48 - 10 = 38\n\\]\n\nI made another mistake. Let's try again:\n\n\\[\n(8 \\times 3) = 24\n\\]\n\nTo achieve this, we can use:\n\n\\[\n(9 - 6) = 3\n\\]\n\nSo the correct equation is:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times (9 - 6) = 24\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n\\[\n9 - 6 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n8 \\times 3 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis is correct. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<8 * (9 - 6)>>>"
