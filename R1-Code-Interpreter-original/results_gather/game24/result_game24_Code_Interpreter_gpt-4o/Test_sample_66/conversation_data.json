    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 5, 7, 10, and 12, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that results in 24. Let's try to find a solution:\n\n\\[\n(5 + 7) \\times (12 - 10) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<((5 + 7) * (12 - 10))>>>"
