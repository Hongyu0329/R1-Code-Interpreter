    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 3, 13, and 13, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination:\n\n\\[\n(13 - 1) + (13 - 3) = 12 + 10 = 22\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(13 + 13) - (3 + 1) = 26 - 4 = 22\n\\]\n\nThis also doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(13 \\times 1) + (13 - 3) = 13 + 10 = 23\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(13 + 1) + (13 - 3) = 14 + 10 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis works! The correct equation is:\n\n\\[\n(13 + 1) + (13 - 3) = 24\n\\]\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n<<<(13 + 1) + (13 - 3)>>>"
