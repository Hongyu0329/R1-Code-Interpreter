    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 1, 11, and 12, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. Start by adding 11 and 12: \\(11 + 12 = 23\\).\n2. Add one of the 1s to 23: \\(23 + 1 = 24\\).\n3. The remaining 1 can be used as a multiplier: \\(24 \\times 1 = 24\\).\n\nThus, the expression is:\n\n\\[\n((11 + 12) + 1) \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((11 + 12) + 1) * 1>>>"
