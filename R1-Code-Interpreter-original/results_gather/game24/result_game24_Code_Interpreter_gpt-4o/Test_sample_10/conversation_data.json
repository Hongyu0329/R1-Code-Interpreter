    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 5, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. Start by considering the possible operations and combinations.\n2. Try to form intermediate results that can lead to 24.\n\nLet's calculate: \n\n\\[\n(5 + 5) \\times (1 + 1) = 10 \\times 2 = 20\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(5 \\times 5) - (1 + 1) = 25 - 2 = 23\n\\]\n\nThis is close, but not quite 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(5 \\times 5) - 1 - 1 = 25 - 1 - 1 = 23\n\\]\n\nStill not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(5 + 5) \\times 1 + 1 = 10 \\times 1 + 1 = 11\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(5 \\times 5) - (1 \\times 1) = 25 - 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis works! The correct equation is:\n\n\\[\n(5 \\times 5) - (1 \\times 1) = 24\n\\]\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n<<<(5 * 5) - (1 * 1)>>>"
