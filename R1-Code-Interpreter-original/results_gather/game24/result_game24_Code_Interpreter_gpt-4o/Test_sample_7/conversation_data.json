    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 4, 6, 13, and 13, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. Start by considering the numbers and possible operations.\n2. Try different combinations and operations to see if they result in 24.\n\nLet's work through this step by step:\n\n- We can try to use multiplication and addition to reach 24.\n- Consider using the numbers 13 and 13 together, as they are the same and might simplify the process.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n1. Multiply 13 by 2 to get 26.\n2. Subtract 6 to get 20.\n3. Add 4 to get 24.\n\nLet's write this as an equation:\n\n\\[\n(13 \\times 2) - 6 + 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, let's verify this solution:\n\n\\[\n(13 + 13) - 6 + 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<((13 + 13) - 6 + 4)>>>"
