    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 3, 7, 13, and 13, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Let's try to find a solution:\n\n1. Start by considering possible combinations and operations.\n2. Test different arithmetic operations to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 3, 7, 13, and 13.\n- Consider the operation: \\((13 - 7) + (13 - 3)\\).\n\nLet's calculate this:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (13 - 7) + (13 - 3)\nresult\nassistant > The expression \\((13 - 7) + (13 - 3)\\) results in 16, not 24. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- Use the numbers 3, 7, 13, and 13.\n- Consider the operation: \\((13 / (13 - 7)) \\times 3\\).\n\nLet's calculate this:# Calculate the new expression\nresult = (13 / (13 - 7)) * 3\nresult\nassistant > The expression \\((13 / (13 - 7)) \\times 3\\) results in 6.5, not 24.
