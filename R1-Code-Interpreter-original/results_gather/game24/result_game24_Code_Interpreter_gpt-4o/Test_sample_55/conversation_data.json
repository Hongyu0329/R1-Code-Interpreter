    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 6, 10, 10, and 10, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. We can start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers.\n2. We need to find a combination of operations that will result in 24.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Use one of the 10s and the 6 to form a product: \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\).\n- Subtract one of the 10s from 60: \\(60 - 10 = 50\\).\n- Subtract the remaining 10 from 50: \\(50 - 10 = 40\\).\n- Finally, divide 40 by 2 to get 24: \\(40 / 2 = 24\\).\n\nLet's verify this approach:\n\n\\[\n((10 \\times 6) - 10 - 10) / 2 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis approach doesn't work as expected. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Add two of the 10s: \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n- Multiply the result by 6: \\(20 \\times 6 = 120\\).\n- Divide 120 by the remaining 10: \\(120 / 10 = 12\\).\n- Finally, multiply 12 by 2 to get 24: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n\nThis approach also doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Add two of the 10s: \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n- Add the remaining 10 to 20: \\(20 + 10 = 30\\).\n- Subtract 6 from 30: \\(30 - 6 = 24\\).\n\nThis approach works. Let's write the final answer:\n\n\\[\n(10 + 10 + 10 - 6) = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<(10 + 10 + 10 - 6)>>>"
