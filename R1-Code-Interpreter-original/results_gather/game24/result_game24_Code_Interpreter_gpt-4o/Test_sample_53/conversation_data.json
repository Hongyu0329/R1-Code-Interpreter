    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 6, 6, and 13, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. Start by considering the numbers and possible operations.\n2. Try different combinations and operations to reach 24.\n\nLet's calculate: \n\n\\[\n(6 \\times 6) - (13 - 1) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n<<<((6*6)-(13-1))>>>"
