    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 12, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that results in 24. Let's try to find such a combination:\n\n\\[\n(12 \\times 2) - (4 \\times 1) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<((12 * 2) - (4 * 1))>>>"
