    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 11, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that results in 24. Let's try to find such a combination:\n\n\\[\n(11 - 3) + (11 - 8) = 8 + 3 = 11\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(11 - 8) \\times 3 + 11 = 3 \\times 3 + 11 = 9 + 11 = 20\n\\]\n\nThis also doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(11 - 3) \\times (11 - 8) = 8 \\times 3 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis works! So the answer is:\n\n\\[\n(11 - 3) \\times (11 - 8) = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(11 - 3) * (11 - 8)>>>"
