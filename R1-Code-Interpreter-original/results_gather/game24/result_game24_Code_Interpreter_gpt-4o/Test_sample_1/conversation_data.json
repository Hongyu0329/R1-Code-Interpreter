    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 12, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. Start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. We can try multiplying 12 by 2 to get 24, but we need to use the other numbers as well.\n3. Consider using the two 1s to adjust the equation.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n\\[\n(12 \\times 2) - (1 + 1) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<((12 * 2) - (1 + 1))>>>"
