    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 9, 12, and 12, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Let's try to find a solution:\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\n\\[\n(12 \\div (1 + 11)) \\times 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n<<<((12/(1+11))*12)>>>"
