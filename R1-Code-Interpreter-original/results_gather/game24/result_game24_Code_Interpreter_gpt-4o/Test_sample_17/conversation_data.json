    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 2, 3, 12, and 12, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n1. Start by considering the multiplication of the two 12s: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n2. Now, we need to use the remaining numbers 3 and 2 in a way that doesn't alter the result of 24.\n\nWe can achieve this by:\n\n\\[\n(12 \\times 2) - (3 \\times 2) = 24 - 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(12 \\times 2) = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, we can add 3 and subtract 3 to keep the result unchanged:\n\n\\[\n(12 \\times 2) + (3 - 3) = 24 + 0 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis approach works. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n\\[\n(12 \\times 2) + (3 - 3) = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(12 * 2) + (3 - 3)>>>"
