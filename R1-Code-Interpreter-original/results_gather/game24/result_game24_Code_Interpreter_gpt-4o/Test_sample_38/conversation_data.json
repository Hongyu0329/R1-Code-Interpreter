    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that result in 24. Let's try to find such a combination:\n\n\\[\n(3 \\times 8) - (12 - 11) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<((3*8)-(12-11))>>>"
