    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 8, 10, and 13, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that results in 24. Let's try to find such a combination:\n\n\\[\n(13 - 10) \\times (8 - 1) = 3 \\times 7 = 21\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(13 + 10) - (8 + 1) = 23 - 9 = 14\n\\]\n\nThis also doesn't work.
