    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. Start with the largest number, 8.\n2. Consider multiplying it by 3 to get close to 24: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n3. To get 3 using the remaining numbers 1, 1, and 2, we can do: \\(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\).\n4. We need to adjust our approach to use multiplication or division to get 3.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Use 8 and 2 to get 16: \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\).\n2. Add 1 and 1 to get 2: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n3. Add the results: \\(16 + 2 = 18\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another:\n\n1. Use 8 and 2 to get 16: \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\).\n2. Use 1 and 1 to get 1: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\).\n3. Add the results: \\(16 + 8 = 24\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work either, so let's try another:\n\n1. Use 8 and 2 to get 16: \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\).\n2. Use 1 and 1 to get 1: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n3.
