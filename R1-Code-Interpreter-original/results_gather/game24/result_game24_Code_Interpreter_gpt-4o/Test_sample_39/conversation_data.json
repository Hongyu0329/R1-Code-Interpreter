    "\nassistant > To solve the problem using the numbers 2, 11, 11, and 11, we need to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n1. We can start by adding two of the 11s: \\(11 + 11 = 22\\).\n2. Then, add the remaining 11: \\(22 + 11 = 33\\).\n3. Finally, subtract 9 (which is \\(11 - 2\\)) from 33: \\(33 - 9 = 24\\).\n\nSo, the expression is: \\((11 + 11 + 11) - (11 - 2)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<((11 + 11 + 11) - (11 - 2))>>>"
