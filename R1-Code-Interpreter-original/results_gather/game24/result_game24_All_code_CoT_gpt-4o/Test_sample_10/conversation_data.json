    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 5 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have two 1s and two 5s.\n2. We need to find a combination of operations that will result in 24.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider how we can use multiplication and addition to reach 24, given that we have two 5s which can be multiplied to get 25, and then adjust using the 1s.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n- Multiply the two 5s to get 25.\n- Subtract one of the 1s from 25 to get 24.\n- Use the remaining 1 in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as adding and then subtracting it.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to implement this plan:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 5\nresult = (5 * 5) - 1 + (1 - 1)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((5*5)-1+(1-1))>>>\")\n```"
