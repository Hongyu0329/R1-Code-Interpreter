    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once in the equation.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition to reach 24.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n- Multiply 12 by 2 to get 24.\n- Add 1 and 3 to get 4.\n- Subtract 4 from 24 to get 20.\n- Add 4 to 20 to get 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to represent this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (12 * 2) - (1 + 3)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((12*2)-(1+3))>>>\")\n```"
