    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 7, and 10 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 6, 7, and 10 in the equation: \\((1 + 10) \\times (7 - 6)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\((1 + 10) = 11\\)\n- \\((7 - 6) = 1\\)\n- \\(11 \\times 1 = 11\\)\n\nThis doesn't give us 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 6, 7, and 10 in the equation: \\((10 - 7) \\times (6 + 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\((10 - 7) = 3\\)\n- \\((6 + 1) = 7\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 6, 7, and 10 in the equation: \\((7 - 1) \\times (10 - 6)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\((7 - 1) = 6\\)\n- \\((10 - 6) = 4\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\)\n\nThis gives us the correct result. Now, let's write the Python code to output this solution.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 1, 6, 7, and 10\nresult = (7 - 1) * (10 - 6)\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(\"<<<((7 - 1) * (10 - 6))>>>\")\n```"
