    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 8, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers 3, 7, 8, and 8.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 8, 8, and 3 to form the expression: (8 / (8 - 3)) = 8 / 5 = 1.6\n- Multiply this result by 7 to get 24: 1.6 * 7 = 11.2\n\nHowever, this doesn't give us an integer result. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 8, 8, and 3 to form the expression: (8 - 3) = 5\n- Multiply this result by 7 to get 35: 5 * 7 = 35\n- Subtract 11 from 35 to get 24: 35 - 11 = 24\n\nThis approach doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 8, 8, and 3 to form the expression: (8 * 3) = 24\n- Subtract 7 from 24 to get 17: 24 - 7 = 17\n\nThis approach doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 8, 8, and 3 to form the expression: (8 + 8) = 16\n- Add 7 to 16 to get 23: 16 + 7 = 23\n- Add 1 to 23 to get 24: 23 + 1 = 24\n\nThis approach doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 8, 8, and 3 to form the expression: (8 * 3) = 24\n- Subtract 7 from 24 to get 17: 24 - 7 = 17\n\nThis approach doesn't work either.
