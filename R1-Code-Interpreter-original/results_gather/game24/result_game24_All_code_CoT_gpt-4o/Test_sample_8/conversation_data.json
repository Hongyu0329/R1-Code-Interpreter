    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 11, and 12.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different operations and groupings to see what works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 11 and 12 to get a larger number: \\(11 + 12 = 23\\).\n- Add one of the 1s to 23 to get 24: \\(23 + 1 = 24\\).\n- The remaining 1 can be used in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as multiplying by 1.\n\nThus, the equation can be structured as: \\((11 + 12) + 1 \\times 1 = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (11 + 12) + 1 * 1\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((11 + 12) + 1 * 1)>>>\")\n```"
