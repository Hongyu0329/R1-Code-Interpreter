    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 5, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 5, 5, and 12.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations (+, -, *, /) that results in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 5, 5, and 12 to form a part of the equation: (5 * 5) - 1 + 12 = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print this result.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 1\nb = 5\nc = 5\nd = 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the equation\nresult = (b * c) - a + d\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```"
