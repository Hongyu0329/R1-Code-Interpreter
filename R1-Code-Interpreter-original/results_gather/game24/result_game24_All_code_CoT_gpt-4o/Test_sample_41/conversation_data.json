    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 10, 13, 13, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have three 13s and one 10. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to reach 24.\n2. One approach is to consider using addition and subtraction to balance the numbers.\n3. We can try to use the 10 to adjust the sum of the 13s.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Use two 13s to make 26 (13 + 13).\n- Subtract the third 13 from 26 to get 13 (26 - 13).\n- Finally, subtract 10 from 13 to get 3 (13 - 10).\n- Multiply the result by 8 to get 24 (3 * 8).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 10, 13, 13, 13\n\n# Calculate the result using the plan\nresult = ((b + c) - d) * (a - 7)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the result of the equation using the given numbers and operations."
