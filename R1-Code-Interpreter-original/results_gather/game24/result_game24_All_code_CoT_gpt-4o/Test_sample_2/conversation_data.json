    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 2, and 8.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations (+, -, *, /) that results in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 in the following way: \\((8 - 1) \\times (2 + 1)\\).\n\nThis results in:\n\n- \\(8 - 1 = 7\\)\n- \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\)\n\nHowever, this does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 in the following way: \\((8 \\times 2) - (1 + 1)\\).\n\nThis results in:\n\n- \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\)\n- \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(16 - 2 = 14\\)\n\nThis also does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 in the following way: \\((8 \\times 3) - (2 \\times 1)\\).\n\nThis results in:\n\n- \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(24 - 2 = 22\\)\n\nThis also does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 in the following way: \\((8 \\times 2) + (1 \\times 1)\\).\n\nThis results in:\n\n- \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n- \\(16 + 1 = 17\\)\n\nThis also does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 in the following way: \\((8 \\times 2) + (1 + 1)\\).\n\nThis results in:\n\n- \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\)\n- \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(16 + 2 = 18\\)\n\nThis also does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 in the following way: \\((8 \\times 3) - (1 \\times 2)\\).\n\nThis results in:\n\n- \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)\n- \\(24 - 2 = 22\\)\n\nThis also does not give us 24.
