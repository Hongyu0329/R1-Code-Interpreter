    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 5, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 12, and see if we can use it effectively.\n- We can try multiplying 4 and 5 to get 20, and then add 4 to get 24.\n- This leaves us with 11, which we can subtract from 12 to get 1.\n- Finally, we can add this 1 to the result of 20 to get 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to represent this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 4, 5, 11, and 12\nresult = ((4 * 5) + (12 - 11))\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses each number exactly once and performs the operations to achieve the result of 24."
