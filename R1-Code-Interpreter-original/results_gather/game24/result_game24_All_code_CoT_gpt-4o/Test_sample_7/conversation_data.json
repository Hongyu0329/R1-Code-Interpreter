    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 13, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 13s, which can be used to form a subtraction or addition that results in a smaller or larger number.\n2. We can try to use multiplication or division to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n3. We need to ensure that the final result is 24.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use one 13 and 4 to form a multiplication: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n- Use the other 13 and 6 to form a subtraction: \\(13 - 13 = 0\\).\n- Combine these results to form the final equation.\n\nHere's the Python code to demonstrate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (4 * 6) - (13 - 13)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((4*6)-(13-13))>>>\")\n```"
