    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 6, 12, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two pairs of numbers: 6 and 12.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations to see if we can reach 24.\n3. One possible approach is to use multiplication and division, as they can significantly change the magnitude of the numbers.\n4. We can try multiplying one pair and dividing by the other pair to see if it results in 24.\n\nLet's try the following equation: \\((6 \\times 12) / (6 / 12)\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 6, 6, 12, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = (a * c) / (b / d)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({a}*{c})/({b}/{d})>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the equation that results in 24 using the given numbers."
