    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Start by considering the numbers 5 and 5. We can multiply them to get 25.\n- Then, consider the number 11. We can subtract it from 25 to get 14.\n- Finally, add the number 12 to 14 to get 26, which is not 24. So, let's try another approach.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we find that:\n\n- Subtract 5 from 12 to get 7.\n- Multiply 7 by 5 to get 35.\n- Subtract 11 from 35 to get 24.\n\nThis gives us the equation: ((12 - 5) * 5) - 11 = 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this equation:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 5, 5, 11, 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the equation\nresult = ((d - a) * b) - c\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<(({d} - {a}) * {b}) - {c} = {result}>>>\")\n```"
