    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 11, 13, 13, and 13.\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n3. **Experiment with combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 24.\n\nGiven the numbers, one possible approach is to use multiplication and addition. We can try multiplying two of the 13s and then adjust the result using the other numbers.\n\nLet's try the following steps:\n\n- Multiply two of the 13s: \\(13 \\times 13 = 169\\)\n- Subtract 11 from 169: \\(169 - 11 = 158\\)\n- Divide 158 by the remaining 13: \\(158 / 13 = 12.1538\\) (This doesn't work as it doesn't result in an integer)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 11 by 2: \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\)\n- Add 13 to 22: \\(22 + 13 = 35\\)\n- Subtract the remaining 13: \\(35 - 13 = 22\\) (This doesn't work either)\n\nAfter several trials, let's try:\n\n- Add two 13s: \\(13 + 13 = 26\\)\n- Subtract 11 from 26: \\(26 - 11 = 15\\)\n- Add the remaining 13: \\(15 + 13 = 28\\) (This doesn't work)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n- Add 11 and 13: \\(11 + 13 = 24\\)\n- Multiply the result by 1 (using the remaining 13 divided by 13): \\(24 \\times (13/13) = 24\\)\n\nThis approach works. Let's write the final Python code to reflect this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13\nresult = (11 + 13) * (13 / 13)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((11 + 13) * (13 / 13))>>>\")\n```"
