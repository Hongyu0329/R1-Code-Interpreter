    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 3, 12, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 12s, which can be used to form a larger number or to simplify the equation.\n2. We can try to combine the numbers in different ways using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n3. We need to ensure that the final result is 24 and that all numbers are used exactly once.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the two 12s to form a multiplication: 12 * 2 = 24.\n- Then, use the remaining numbers 3 and 12 to form a division: 12 / 3 = 4.\n- Finally, subtract the result of the division from the multiplication: 24 - 4 = 20.\n\nHowever, this doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the two 12s to form a division: 12 / 12 = 1.\n- Use the remaining numbers 2 and 3 to form a multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.\n- Finally, multiply the results: 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the two 12s to form a multiplication: 12 * 2 = 24.\n- Use the remaining numbers 3 and 12 to form a division: 12 / 3 = 4.\n- Finally, add the results: 24 + 4 = 28.\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the two 12s to form a division: 12 / 12 = 1.\n- Use the remaining numbers 2 and 3 to form a multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.\n- Finally, add the results: 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the two 12s to form a division: 12 / 12 = 1.\n- Use the remaining numbers 2 and 3 to form a multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.\n- Finally, multiply the results: 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24.
