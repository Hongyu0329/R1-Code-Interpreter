    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 10, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different operations and groupings to see which combination works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 3, 8, 10, and 11.\n- Calculate: \\((3 \\times 8) - (11 - 10)\\)\n\nThis equation uses each number once and results in 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 3, 8, 10, 11\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen operations\nresult = (a * b) - (d - c)\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<({a}*{b})-({d}-{c})>>>\")\n```"
