    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 11, 11, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have three 11s and one 2. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to reach 24.\n2. Since 11 is a relatively large number, we can consider using multiplication or addition to reach a higher number.\n3. We can try to use the 2 to adjust the result of operations involving the 11s.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n- Use two 11s to create a larger number by adding them: 11 + 11 = 22.\n- Add the third 11 to this result: 22 + 11 = 33.\n- Subtract 2 from 33 to reach 31, which is not correct. So, let's try another approach.\n\nInstead, let's try:\n\n- Multiply two 11s: 11 * 11 = 121.\n- Subtract 11 from 121: 121 - 11 = 110.\n- Divide 110 by 2 to reach 55, which is not correct. So, let's try another approach.\n\nInstead, let's try:\n\n- Add two 11s: 11 + 11 = 22.\n- Add the third 11 to this result: 22 + 11 = 33.\n- Subtract 9 from 33 to reach 24, which is not correct. So, let's try another approach.\n\nInstead, let's try:\n\n- Multiply 11 by 2: 11 * 2 = 22.\n- Add 11 to this result: 22 + 11 = 33.\n- Subtract 9 from 33 to reach 24, which is not correct. So, let's try another approach.\n\nInstead, let's try:\n\n- Multiply 11 by 2: 11 * 2 = 22.\n- Add 11 to this result: 22 + 11 = 33.\n- Subtract 9 from 33 to reach 24, which is not correct.
