    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 10, and 10 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 3, 7, 10, 10.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- Use the numbers 10, 10, 7, and 3.\n- Calculate: ((10 + 10) + (7 - 3)) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this result.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 3, 7, 10, 10\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen equation\nresult = ((c + d) + (b - a))\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<((10 + 10) + (7 - 3)) = {result}>>>\")\n```"
