    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 2, 2, and 12.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different operations and groupings to see what works.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition: \\((2 \\times 12) + (2 \\times 2)\\).\n\nThis gives us:\n\n- \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n- \\(24 + 4 = 28\\)\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use multiplication and subtraction: \\((12 \\times 2) - (2 \\times 2)\\).\n\nThis gives us:\n\n- \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n- \\(24 - 4 = 20\\)\n\nThis also doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition: \\((12 + 2) \\times (2 - 2)\\).\n\nThis gives us:\n\n- \\(12 + 2 = 14\\)\n- \\(2 - 2 = 0\\)\n- \\(14 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition: \\((12 \\times 2) + (2 - 2)\\).\n\nThis gives us:\n\n- \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\)\n- \\(2 - 2 = 0\\)\n- \\(24 + 0 = 24\\)\n\nThis works! So the final equation is:\n\n\\((12 \\times 2) + (2 - 2) = 24\\)\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (12 * 2) + (2 - 2)\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(\"<<<((12 * 2) + (2 - 2)) = {}>>>\".format(result))\n```"
