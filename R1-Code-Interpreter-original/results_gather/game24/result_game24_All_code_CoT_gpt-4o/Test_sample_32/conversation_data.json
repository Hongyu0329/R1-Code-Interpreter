    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 11, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have two 11s, which can be combined in various ways, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n2. We also have the numbers 1 and 2, which can be used to adjust the result of operations involving the 11s.\n3. We need to find a combination of operations that results in 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- We can start by adding the two 11s: \\(11 + 11 = 22\\).\n- Then, we can add 2 to 22: \\(22 + 2 = 24\\).\n- Finally, we can multiply the result by 1 (which doesn't change the value): \\(24 \\times 1 = 24\\).\n\nThis gives us the equation: \\((11 + 11) + 2 \\times 1 = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (11 + 11) + 2 * 1\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((11 + 11) + 2 * 1)>>>\")\n```"
