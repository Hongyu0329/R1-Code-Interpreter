    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 12, and 12 to form an equation that results in 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 3, 8, 12, 12.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that equals 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, we find that the following equation works:\n\n- ((12 / (12 - 8)) * 3) = 24\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print this result.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 3\nb = 8\nc = 12\nd = 12\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen equation\nresult = ((d / (d - b)) * a)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<((12 / (12 - 8)) * 3)>>>\")\n```"
