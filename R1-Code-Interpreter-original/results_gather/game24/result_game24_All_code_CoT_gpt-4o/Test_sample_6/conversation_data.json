    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 2, and 13.\n2. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24.\n3. We can try different operations and groupings to see what works.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 in the following way: \\((13 - 1) \\times (2 + 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\).\n\nHowever, this does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 in the following way: \\((13 + 1) \\times (2 - 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(14 \\times 1 = 14\\).\n\nThis also does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 in the following way: \\((13 + 1) + (2 \\times 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(14 + 2 = 16\\).\n\nThis also does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 in the following way: \\((13 \\times 2) - (1 + 1)\\).\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n- \\(26 - 2 = 24\\).\n\nThis gives us the desired result of 24. Now, let's write the Python code to output this solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 1, 2, 13\n\n# Calculate the result using the chosen equation\nresult = (d * c) - (a + b)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<(({} * {}) - ({} + {}))>>>\".format(d, c, a, b))\n```"
