    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once in the equation.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We need to find a combination of operations and numbers that result in 24.\n2. We can try different combinations of operations and groupings to see which one works.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 in the following way: \\((3 \\times 8) - (12 - 11)\\).\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this solution:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result using the given numbers and operations\nresult = (3 * 8) - (12 - 11)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<((3*8)-(12-11))>>>\")\n```"
