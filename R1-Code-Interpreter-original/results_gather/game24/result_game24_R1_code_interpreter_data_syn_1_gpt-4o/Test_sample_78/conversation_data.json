    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 6, 6, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 3, 6, 6, and 12.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n- We can also consider addition and subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try some combinations manually:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 6, we get 36. Subtracting 12 gives us 24, but we still have the number 3 left, which doesn't fit.\n- If we multiply 6 and 3, we get 18. Adding 6 gives us 24, but we still have the number 12 left, which doesn't fit.\n\nLet's try using Python to systematically check possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [3, 6, 6, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 3, 6, 6, and 12. Let's verify one of these expressions to ensure it is correct:\n\n- One of the expressions is `(12/6) + (6*3)`. Let's evaluate it:\n  - `12/6` equals 2.\n  - `6*3` equals 18.\n  - Adding these results: `2 + 18` equals 20, which is incorrect.\n\nIt seems there was a mistake in the code logic or the output interpretation. Let's manually verify and find a correct expression:\n\n- Consider the expression `(6 * 3) + (12 - 6)`:\n  - `6 * 3` equals 18.\n  - `12 - 6` equals 6.\n  - Adding these results: `18 + 6` equals 24, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is `(6 * 3) + (12 - 6)`.\n\n<<<((6 * 3) + (12 - 6))>>>"
