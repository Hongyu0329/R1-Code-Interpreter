    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 7, 7, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. We need to consider the order of operations (parentheses) to ensure the correct calculation.\n3. We can use each number only once, but we must use all of them.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how it can be combined with others.\n- Try using multiplication and division to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n- Use addition and subtraction to fine-tune the result to 24.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [7, 7, 11, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression with parentheses\n        expr1 = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        expr2 = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        expr3 = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        expr4 = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})))\"\n        expr5 = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n        \n        for expr in [expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4, expr5]:\n            if eval(expr) == target:\n                return expr\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 7, 7, 11, and 12. Let's analyze the results:\n\n- The expression `((7/7)+(11+12))` evaluates to 24 because:\n  - \\( \\frac{7}{7} = 1 \\)\n  - \\( 11 + 12 = 23 \\)\n  - \\( 1 + 23 = 24 \\)\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and achieves the target of 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((7/7)+(11+12))>>>"
