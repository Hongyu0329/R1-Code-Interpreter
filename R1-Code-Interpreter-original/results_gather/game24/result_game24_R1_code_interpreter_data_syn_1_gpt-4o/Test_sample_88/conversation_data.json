    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and see if they lead to 24.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if that helps.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- Start with addition and multiplication, as they often help reach larger numbers quickly.\n- Consider using subtraction and division to adjust the result to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- One possible approach is to try multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the others.\n- Another approach is to try adding or subtracting numbers and then multiplying or dividing.\n\nLet's write a Python script to test different combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 5, 6, 9]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 9. Let's verify one of these expressions to ensure it is correct:\n\n- Expression: \\((9 - 5) \\times (6 \\times 1)\\)\n\nLet's evaluate this expression:\n\n1. Calculate \\(9 - 5 = 4\\).\n2. Calculate \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\).\n3. Multiply the results: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\nThis expression correctly evaluates to 24. Therefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<((9-5)*(6*1))>>>"
