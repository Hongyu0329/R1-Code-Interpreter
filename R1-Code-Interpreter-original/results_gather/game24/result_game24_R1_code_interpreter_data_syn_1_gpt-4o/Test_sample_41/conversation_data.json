    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 10, 13, 13, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We have three 13s and one 10. This suggests that we might need to use multiplication or division to handle the repeated 13s effectively.\n2. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's explore some possibilities:\n\n- We can try multiplying two 13s and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n- We can also try adding or subtracting combinations of 13s and 10.\n\nTo find a solution, let's write a Python script to test different combinations and operations to see if we can achieve 24.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [10, 13, 13, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple equivalent expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 10, 13, 13, and 13. The expression `(13/13) + (10 + 13)` simplifies to `1 + 23`, which equals 24. This expression uses each number exactly once and achieves the target value.\n\nThe repetition in the output is due to the permutations and combinations generating equivalent expressions multiple times. However, the expression is valid and satisfies the problem's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(13/13) + (10 + 13)>>>"
