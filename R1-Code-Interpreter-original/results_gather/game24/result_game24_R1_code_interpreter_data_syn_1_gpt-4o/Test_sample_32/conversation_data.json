    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 11, and 11 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We have two 11s, which can be useful for multiplication or addition.\n2. The number 1 can be used to adjust the result slightly, either by addition or subtraction.\n3. The number 2 can be used to double or halve other numbers.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering the multiplication of the two 11s: \\(11 \\times 11 = 121\\).\n- This result is too large, so let's try using addition: \\(11 + 11 = 22\\).\n- We are close to 24, so we need to add 2 more to reach 24.\n- We can use the numbers 1 and 2 to achieve this: \\(22 + 2 = 24\\).\n\nNow, let's verify if this combination uses all numbers:\n\n- \\(11 + 11 = 22\\)\n- \\(22 + 2 = 24\\)\n\nThis uses the numbers 11, 11, and 2. We still need to use the number 1. We can incorporate it by using it in a way that doesn't change the result, such as multiplying by 1:\n\n- \\((11 + 11) + (2 \\times 1) = 24\\)\n\nThis equation uses all the numbers exactly once and results in 24. Let's write this in a clear format:\n\n\\[\n(11 + 11) + (2 \\times 1) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((11 + 11) + (2 * 1))>>>"
