    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 4, 5, and 5 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in various combinations.\n2. We need to ensure that the operations are performed in such a way that the final result is 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- We can also consider using subtraction to adjust the total to exactly 24.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [4, 4, 5, 5]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions, but we need to identify the one that correctly evaluates to 24. Let's analyze the results:\n\n1. `(4/5)+(4*5)` does not equal 24.\n2. `(5-4)+(5*4)` equals 21, not 24.\n3. `(5+5)-(4*4)` equals 2, not 24.\n\nIt seems there was an error in the code logic or the output interpretation. Let's manually verify and find the correct expression:\n\nGiven the numbers 4, 4, 5, and 5, let's try a different approach:\n\n- We can try using multiplication and addition to reach 24.\n- Consider the expression: `(5 * 5) - (4 / 4)`\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n- `5 * 5 = 25`\n- `4 / 4 = 1`\n- `25 - 1 = 24`\n\nThis expression correctly evaluates to 24. Therefore, the correct expression is:\n\n<<<(5 * 5) - (4 / 4)>>>"
