    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 to make 24, we need to consider various combinations of arithmetic operations and groupings. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 1, 2, and 8.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n- We can also consider addition and subtraction to adjust the result.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Try using multiplication and addition:\n   - (1 * 8) + (1 * 2) = 8 + 2 = 10 (not 24)\n\n2. Try using division and multiplication:\n   - (8 / 1) * (2 + 1) = 8 * 3 = 24\n\nThis combination seems to work. Let's verify it with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Verify the calculation\nresult = (8 / 1) * (2 + 1)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The calculation is correct, and the combination of operations results in 24. Therefore, the solution to the problem using the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 8 is:\n\n<<<(8 / 1) * (2 + 1)>>>"
