    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 4, 6, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try using addition and multiplication, as they are often effective in reaching higher numbers.\n2. We can also consider subtraction and division to adjust the total to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition:\n  - \\( (1 + 4) \\times 6 = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\) (too high)\n  - \\( 12 - (1 + 4) = 12 - 5 = 7 \\) (not useful directly)\n  - \\( 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\) (not useful directly)\n  - \\( 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\) (but we don't have 2 directly)\n\n- Consider using division to adjust:\n  - \\( 12 \\div 6 = 2 \\)\n  - \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) (not useful directly)\n  - \\( 12 \\div (6 - 4) = 12 \\div 2 = 6 \\) (not useful directly)\n\n- Try using subtraction and addition:\n  - \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\)\n  - \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\) (but we need to use 1 as well)\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using Python to explore all possible combinations and operations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport operator\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [1, 4, 6, 12]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\nops = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.truediv]\nop_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = ops[0](nums[0], nums[1])\n        result = ops[1](result, nums[2])\n        result = ops[2](result, nums[3])\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for op_perm in permutations(ops, 3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, op_perm) == target:\n            # Construct the expression string\n            expr = f\"(({num_perm[0]} {op_symbols[ops.index(op_perm[0])]} {num_perm[1]}) {op_symbols[ops.index(op_perm[1])]} {num_perm[2]}) {op_symbols[ops.index(op_perm[2])]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and operations to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 4, 6, and 12. Let's verify one of these expressions to ensure it is correct:\n\n- \\(((12 - 6) \\times 4) / 1 = 24\\)\n\nThis expression correctly uses all the numbers and evaluates to 24. Therefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<((12 - 6) * 4) / 1>>>"
