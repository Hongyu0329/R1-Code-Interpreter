    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 3, 4, 11, and 12 to make 24, we need to explore different combinations of arithmetic operations. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing these numbers in various ways.\n2. We need to ensure that the operations are valid (e.g., no division by zero).\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 12, and see if we can use it effectively.\n- We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n- We can also try dividing one number by another and then using the result in further operations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [3, 4, 11, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 3, 4, 11, and 12. However, the task is to find a single valid expression that uses each number exactly once and results in 24. Let's analyze the output to identify a correct expression.\n\nFrom the output, we can see that the expression `(11 + 12) + (4 - 3)` evaluates to 24:\n\n- \\(11 + 12 = 23\\)\n- \\(4 - 3 = 1\\)\n- \\(23 + 1 = 24\\)\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and results in the target value of 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((11 + 12) + (4 - 3))>>>"
