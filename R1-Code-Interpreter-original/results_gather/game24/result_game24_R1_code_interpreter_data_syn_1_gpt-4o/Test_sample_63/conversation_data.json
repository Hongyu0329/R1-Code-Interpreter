    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 2, 2, 8, and 12 to obtain 24, we need to consider different combinations of arithmetic operations and groupings. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding and subtracting numbers in different ways.\n2. We can also try multiplying and dividing numbers.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and see if we can find a combination that results in 24.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [2, 2, 8, 12]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        result = eval(expression)\n        # Check if the result is equal to the target\n        if result == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        expr = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if expr:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the correct expression.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24, but they are not using all four numbers in a single expression. The goal is to use each number exactly once in a valid arithmetic expression that results in 24.\n\nLet's refine our approach to ensure that all four numbers are used in a single expression. We need to find a combination of operations and groupings that correctly uses all numbers and results in 24.\n\nUpon reviewing the problem, a possible solution is to use the numbers in a way that combines them effectively. Let's try a different approach manually:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication and addition:\n   - \\( (2 \\times 12) = 24 \\)\n   - This uses two numbers, so we need to incorporate the other two numbers (2 and 8) in a way that doesn't change the result.\n\n2. We can try:\n   - \\( (2 \\times 12) + (2 - 2) = 24 \\)\n   - This uses all numbers: 2, 2, 8, and 12.\n\nHowever, this doesn't use the number 8. Let's try another approach:\n\n- \\( (8 \\times 2) + (12 - 2) = 24 \\)\n\nThis uses all numbers: 2, 2, 8, and 12, and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is:\n\n<<<((8 * 2) + (12 - 2))>>>"
