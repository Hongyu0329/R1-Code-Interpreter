    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 5, 6, and 12.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n- We can also consider addition and subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Try using multiplication and addition:\n   - (6 * 5) = 30, then adjust with 1 and 12.\n   - (12 - 6) = 6, then (6 * 5) = 30, and adjust with 1.\n\n2. Try using division:\n   - (12 / 6) = 2, then adjust with 1 and 5.\n\nLet's write a Python script to test these combinations and find a valid equation.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 5, 6, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 12. However, the expressions are not formatted correctly to match the problem's requirement of using each number exactly once in a single equation. \n\nThe correct approach is to find a single expression that uses all four numbers exactly once and evaluates to 24. Let's analyze the results and find the correct expression:\n\nFrom the output, we can see that the expression `((6+12)+(1+5))` evaluates to 24. This expression uses each number exactly once and satisfies the problem's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((6+12)+(1+5))>>>"
