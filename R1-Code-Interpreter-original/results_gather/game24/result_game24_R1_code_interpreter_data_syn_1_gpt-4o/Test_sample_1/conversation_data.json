    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust using addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24, but we still need to use the two 1s.\n- We can try using the 1s to adjust the result of 12 * 2.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and operations to find a valid equation.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 1, 2, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i+1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides multiple expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 12. However, we need to select one valid expression that uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\nFrom the output, the expression `(2*12)+(1-1)` evaluates to 24:\n\n- \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\)\n- \\(1 - 1 = 0\\)\n- \\(24 + 0 = 24\\)\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\n<<<(2*12)+(1-1)>>>"
