    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 8, 11, and 11 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering different combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value.\n2. We can also consider using division to reduce the numbers if needed.\n\nLet's explore some possibilities:\n\n- We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n- We can also try adding or subtracting first and then multiplying or dividing.\n\nGiven the numbers 6, 8, 11, and 11, let's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- One potential approach is to use multiplication to get close to 24 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try some calculations:\n\n- If we multiply 6 and 4, we get 24, but we don't have a 4.\n- If we multiply 6 and 8, we get 48, which is too high, but we can try to adjust it.\n- If we multiply 11 and 2, we get 22, which is close to 24.\n\nLet's try using these ideas in a Python script to find a valid equation:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [6, 8, 11, 11]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 6, 8, 11, and 11. The expressions are:\n\n1. \\((8 - 6) + (11 + 11)\\)\n2. \\((8 + 11) + (11 - 6)\\)\n3. \\((11 + 11) + (8 - 6)\\)\n\nThese expressions correctly use each number exactly once and result in 24. \n\nLet's choose one of these expressions as the final answer:\n\n<<<(8 - 6) + (11 + 11)>>>"
