    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 8, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the use of multiplication and division, as they can quickly change the magnitude of numbers.\n2. We can also consider using addition and subtraction to adjust the result to 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- If we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24. However, we still need to use the other numbers.\n- If we try to use division, we can divide 12 by 2 to get 6, but then we need to use 8 and another 12 to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using Python to explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [2, 8, 12, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions, but we need to identify the correct one that evaluates to 24. Let's analyze the results:\n\n1. **(12-2)-(8*12)**: This evaluates to -86, not 24.\n2. **(12-8)-(2*12)**: This evaluates to -20, not 24.\n3. **(12-8)*(12/2)**: This evaluates to 24, which is correct.\n4. **(12/12)+(2*8)**: This evaluates to 17, not 24.\n\nThe expression **(12-8)*(12/2)** correctly evaluates to 24. Therefore, this is the solution we are looking for.\n\n<<<(12-8)*(12/2)>>>"
