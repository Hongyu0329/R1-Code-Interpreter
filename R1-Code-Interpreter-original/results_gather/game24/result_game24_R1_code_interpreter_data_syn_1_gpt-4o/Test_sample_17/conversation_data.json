    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 3, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the use of multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We can also consider using addition and subtraction to adjust the final result to 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can try multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the others.\n- We can also try dividing one number by another and then using the result in further operations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to test different combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [2, 3, 12, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24, but it seems there are duplicates due to the way the script is structured. Let's focus on the first valid expression that evaluates to 24:\n\nThe expression `(3-2)*(12+12)` evaluates to 24. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Calculate `3 - 2` which equals `1`.\n- Calculate `12 + 12` which equals `24`.\n- Multiply the results: `1 * 24` equals `24`.\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and results in the target value of 24.\n\n<<<(3-2)*(12+12)>>>"
