    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 7 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and see if they lead to 24.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if that helps.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Consider using subtraction and division to adjust the result to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- \\( (7 \\times 5) - (2 + 1) = 35 - 3 = 32 \\) (too high)\n- \\( (7 \\times 2) + (5 \\times 1) = 14 + 5 = 19 \\) (too low)\n- \\( (7 + 5) \\times (2 + 1) = 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\) (too high)\n- \\( (7 \\times 2) + (5 - 1) = 14 + 4 = 18 \\) (too low)\n\nNow, let's try using a Python script to systematically check combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 5, 7]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\")\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 7. Let's verify one of these expressions to ensure it is correct:\n\n- \\((1 + 7) \\times (5 - 2) = 8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n\nThis expression correctly uses each number once and evaluates to 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((1+7)*(5-2))>>>"
