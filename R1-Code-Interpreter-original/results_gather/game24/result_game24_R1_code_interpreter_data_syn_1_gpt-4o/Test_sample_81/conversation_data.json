    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 8, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using these numbers:\n\n- One possible approach is to try to form intermediate results that can be combined to make 24.\n- We can start by considering pairs of numbers and see if their operations can lead to a useful intermediate result.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [3, 8, 8, 9]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_solution(numbers, target):\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n                return f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nsolution = find_solution(numbers, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a solution: \\((9-8) \\times (3 \\times 8)\\). Let's verify this:\n\n- \\(9 - 8 = 1\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 24 = 24\\)\n\nThe expression \\((9-8) \\times (3 \\times 8)\\) indeed evaluates to 24, using each number exactly once.\n\n<<<(9-8)*(3*8)>>>"
