    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 9, 9, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try using addition and subtraction to balance the numbers.\n2. Multiplication and division can be used to scale the numbers up or down.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations:\n\n- We can try to form a combination where we multiply two numbers and then adjust the result with the other two numbers.\n- Alternatively, we can try to add or subtract numbers to form intermediate results that can be multiplied or divided to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication and addition:\n   - (9 * 2) + (13 - 9) = 18 + 4 = 22 (not 24)\n   \n2. Consider using division and addition:\n   - (13 / (9 - 9)) + 2 (division by zero, not valid)\n\n3. Consider using subtraction and multiplication:\n   - (13 - 9) * (9 - 2) = 4 * 7 = 28 (not 24)\n\n4. Consider using addition and division:\n   - (13 + 9) / (9 - 2) = 22 / 7 (not an integer)\n\n5. Consider using a combination of operations:\n   - (9 + 9) - (13 - 2) = 18 - 11 = 7 (not 24)\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using Python to explore all possible combinations and operations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [2, 9, 9, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} ({num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute it to find the solution."
