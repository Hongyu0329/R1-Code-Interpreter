    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 7, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and see if they lead to 24.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if that helps.\n3. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations and operations:\n\n- One approach is to try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n- Another approach is to try adding or subtracting first and then multiplying or dividing.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find a valid combination:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [5, 5, 7, 8]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\")\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24, but they are essentially the same due to permutations and operation combinations. The expression that works is:\n\n- \\(((5 \\times 5) + (7 - 8))\\)\n\nThis expression evaluates to 24 as follows:\n- \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n- \\(7 - 8 = -1\\)\n- \\(25 + (-1) = 24\\)\n\nThus, the correct expression using the numbers 5, 5, 7, and 8 to achieve 24 is:\n\n<<<((5*5)+(7-8))>>>"
