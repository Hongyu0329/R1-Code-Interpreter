    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. We can try different operations and combinations to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- If we try to multiply 13 by a number close to 2, we might get close to 24. \n- We can use the numbers 1 and 1 to adjust the result.\n\nLet's try to find a combination using code to automate the process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 1, 2, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i+1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression(numbers, target):\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n                return f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n    return None\n\nexpression = find_expression(numbers, target)\nprint(expression)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct expression.",
    "The code has successfully found an expression that uses the numbers 1, 1, 2, and 13 to achieve the target value of 24. The expression is:\n\n(1 + 1) * (13 - 2) = 24\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and applies basic arithmetic operations to reach the desired result.\n\n<<<(1+1)*(13-2)>>>"
