    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 7, 9, 11, and 11 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the use of addition and subtraction to balance the numbers around 24.\n2. Multiplication and division can be used to scale numbers up or down to reach 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can try using multiplication to increase the value of smaller numbers and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n- We can also try using division to reduce larger numbers and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [7, 9, 11, 11]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i+1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 7, 9, 11, and 11. Let's select one of these valid expressions as the final answer.\n\nOne of the expressions that evaluates to 24 is:\n\n(9 - 7) + (11 + 11)\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\n<<<(9 - 7) + (11 + 11)>>>"
