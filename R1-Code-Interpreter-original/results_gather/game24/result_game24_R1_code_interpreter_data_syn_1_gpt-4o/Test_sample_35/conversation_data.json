    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 6, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 2, 6, 12.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nA potential approach is to try different combinations of operations and groupings to see if we can achieve the target number. We can use a brute-force method to try all possible combinations and permutations of these numbers and operations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [1, 2, 6, 12]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all permutations of numbers\nnumber_permutations = itertools.permutations(numbers)\n\n# Generate all combinations of operations\noperation_combinations = itertools.product(operations, repeat=3)\n\n# Try all combinations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in number_permutations:\n    for ops in operation_combinations:\n        # Generate possible expressions with different parenthesis placements\n        expressions = [\n            f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}{num_perm[2]}){ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}\",\n            f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}({num_perm[1]}{ops[1]}{num_perm[2]})){ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}\",\n            f\"{num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}(({num_perm[1]}{ops[1]}{num_perm[2]}){ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\",\n            f\"{num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}({num_perm[1]}{ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\",\n            f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n        ]\n        \n        # Evaluate each expression\n        for expr in expressions:\n            if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n                print(expr)\n                break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations, evaluating each possible expression to see if it equals 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid expression that uses the numbers 1, 2, 6, and 12 to achieve the target value of 24. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((1 \\times 2) \\times 6) + 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and applies the operations in a way that results in the desired outcome.\n\n<<<((1*2)*6)+12>>>"
