    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and see if they lead to 24.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if that helps.\n\nLet's start by trying some combinations manually:\n\n- One approach is to try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n- We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition/subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- (3 * 7) = 21, then 21 + 11 - 12 = 20 (not 24)\n- (12 - 7) = 5, then 5 * 3 = 15, 15 + 11 = 26 (not 24)\n- (11 + 3) = 14, then 14 + 12 - 7 = 19 (not 24)\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n- (12 / 3) = 4, then 4 * 7 = 28, 28 - 11 = 17 (not 24)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- (11 - 7) = 4, then 4 * 3 = 12, 12 + 12 = 24\n\nThis seems to work. Let's verify this with a code to ensure the operations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Verify the solution using code\nresult = (11 - 7) * 3 + 12\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the operations are correct and yield the desired result of 24. Therefore, the solution to the problem using the numbers 3, 7, 11, and 12 is:\n\n<<<((11 - 7) * 3 + 12)>>>"
