    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. We need to consider the order of operations (parentheses) to ensure the correct calculation.\n3. Since we have two 8s, we can use them in different ways to achieve the target.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24.\n- We can start by trying to multiply two numbers to get a product close to 24, then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- If we multiply 4 and 6, we get 24, but we still have two 8s to use.\n- If we multiply 8 and 3 (which is 24), we need to form 3 using the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try to find a valid expression using these numbers:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [4, 6, 8, 8]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression():\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n                return f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n    return None\n\nexpression = find_expression()\nprint(expression)\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 8. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(4 \\times 6) + (8 - 8) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and correctly evaluates to the target number 24.\n\n<<<(4*6)+(8-8)>>>"
