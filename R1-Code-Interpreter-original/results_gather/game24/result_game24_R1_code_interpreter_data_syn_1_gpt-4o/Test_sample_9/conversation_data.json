    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 3, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to use multiplication and addition, as they are the most straightforward operations to reach higher numbers.\n2. Consider the possibility of using division to adjust the results, especially since we have two 2s, which can be used to divide by 2.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition:\n  - \\( (2 \\times 8) + (2 \\times 3) = 16 + 6 = 22 \\) (not 24)\n  - \\( (8 \\times 3) + (2 + 2) = 24 + 4 = 28 \\) (not 24)\n  - \\( (8 \\times 2) + (3 \\times 2) = 16 + 6 = 22 \\) (not 24)\n\n- Consider using division:\n  - \\( (8 \\times 3) - (2 \\times 2) = 24 - 4 = 20 \\) (not 24)\n  - \\( (8 \\times 2) + (3 - 2) = 16 + 1 = 17 \\) (not 24)\n\n- Try using division in a different way:\n  - \\( (8 \\times 3) / (2 / 2) = 24 / 1 = 24 \\) (this works)\n\nLet's verify this solution using a Python script to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Verify the solution using Python\na, b, c, d = 2, 2, 3, 8\n\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (d * c) / (a / b)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms that the expression \\((8 \\times 3) / (2 / 2) = 24\\) is correct. Therefore, the solution to the problem using the numbers 2, 2, 3, and 8 is:\n\n<<<((8 * 3) / (2 / 2))>>>"
