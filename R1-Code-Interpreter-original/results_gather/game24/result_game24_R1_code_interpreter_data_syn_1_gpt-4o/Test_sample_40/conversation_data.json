    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 5, 6, 12, and 13 to obtain 24, we need to explore different combinations of arithmetic operations. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify possible operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Consider order of operations**: Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations to achieve the desired result.\n\n3. **Try different combinations**: We will try different combinations of numbers and operations to see if we can reach 24.\n\nLet's start by trying some combinations manually:\n\n- One possible approach is to try using multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n\n- We can also try using subtraction and division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate the process of checking different combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [5, 6, 12, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression with the given numbers and operations\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and combinations of operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            # Construct the expression string\n            expression = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 5, 6, 12, and 13. However, we need to verify which of these expressions actually result in 24, as the code might have generated some incorrect expressions due to the logic used.\n\nLet's manually verify the expressions to find the correct one:\n\n1. **((5-6)+(12+13))**: This evaluates to -1 + 25 = 24.\n2. **((5-6)+(13+12))**: This evaluates to -1 + 25 = 24.\n3. **((5+12)-(6-13))**: This evaluates to 17 - (-7) = 24.\n4. **((5+12)+(13-6))**: This evaluates to 17 + 7 = 24.\n5. **((5+13)-(6-12))**: This evaluates to 18 - (-6) = 24.\n6. **((5+13)+(12-6))**: This evaluates to 18 + 6 = 24.\n7. **((12+5)-(6-13))**: This evaluates to 17 - (-7) = 24.\n8. **((12+5)+(13-6))**: This evaluates to 17 + 7 = 24.\n9. **((12-6)+(5+13))**: This evaluates to 6 + 18 = 24.\n10. **((12-6)+(13+5))**: This evaluates to 6 + 18 = 24.\n11. **((12+13)+(5-6))**: This evaluates to 25 - 1 = 24.\n12. **((12+13)-(6-5))**: This evaluates to 25 - 1 = 24.\n13. **((13+5)-(6-12))**: This evaluates to 18 - (-6) = 24.\n14. **((13+5)+(12-6))**: This evaluates to 18 + 6 = 24.\n15. **((13-6)+(5+12))**: This evaluates to 7 + 17 = 24.\n16. **((13-6)+(12+5))**: This evaluates to 7 + 17 = 24.\n17. **((13+12)+(5-6))**: This evaluates to 25 - 1 = 24.\n18. **((13+12)-(6-5))**: This evaluates to 25 - 1 = 24.\n\nAll these expressions evaluate to 24, but let's choose one for the final answer. \n\n<<<((5-6)+(12+13))>>>"
