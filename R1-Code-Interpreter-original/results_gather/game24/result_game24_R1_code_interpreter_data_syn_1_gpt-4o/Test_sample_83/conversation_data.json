    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 9 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the use of multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers quickly.\n2. We can also consider using division to reduce numbers if needed.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- One possible approach is to try multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the others:\n  - \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\), then \\(27 - 9 = 18\\), and \\(18 + 6 = 24\\).\n\nThis seems to work. Let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (9 * 3) - 9 + 6\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression \\((9 \\times 3) - 9 + 6\\) equals 24. Therefore, the correct equation using the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 9 is:\n\n\\[\n(9 \\times 3) - 9 + 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((9*3)-9+6)>>>"
