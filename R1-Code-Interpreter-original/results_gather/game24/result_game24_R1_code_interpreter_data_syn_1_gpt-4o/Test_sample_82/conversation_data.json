    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 10, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the sum of two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 24.\n2. We can also consider multiplication and division, as they can quickly change the magnitude of numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- If we add 5 and 5, we get 10. Then, we have 10 and 13 left. We can try:\n  - \\( (5 + 5) + (13 - 10) = 10 + 3 = 13 \\) (not 24)\n  - \\( (5 + 5) \\times (13 - 10) = 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) (not 24)\n  \n- If we multiply 5 and 5, we get 25. Then, we have 10 and 13 left. We can try:\n  - \\( (5 \\times 5) - (13 - 10) = 25 - 3 = 22 \\) (not 24)\n  - \\( (5 \\times 5) - (10 - 13) = 25 + 3 = 28 \\) (not 24)\n\n- If we consider using division, we can try:\n  - \\( (13 - 10) = 3 \\), then \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\), and \\( 25 - 3 = 22 \\) (not 24)\n  - \\( (13 - 10) = 3 \\), then \\( 5 + 5 = 10 \\), and \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) (not 24)\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using Python to explore all possible combinations and operations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [5, 5, 10, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 5, 5, 10, and 13. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5}{5}\\right) + (10 + 13) = 1 + 23 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and achieves the target value of 24.\n\n<<<(5/5)+(10+13)>>>"
