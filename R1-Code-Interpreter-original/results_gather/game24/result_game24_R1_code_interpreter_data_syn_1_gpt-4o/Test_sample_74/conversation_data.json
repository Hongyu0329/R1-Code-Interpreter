    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 8, 9, 10, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 8, 9, 10, 13.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nTo find a solution, we can try different combinations of operations and groupings. Let's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by trying to combine two numbers to get a result that can be easily combined with the others to reach 24.\n- We can try different operations and see if they lead us closer to 24.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate the process of trying different combinations and operations to find a valid equation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression with the given numbers and operations\n    a, b, c, d = nums\n    op1, op2, op3 = ops\n    try:\n        # Try different parenthesizations\n        if eval(f\"({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d})\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\"\n        if eval(f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\") == 24:\n            return f\"(({a}{op1}{b}){op2}{c}){op3}{d}\"\n        if eval(f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d}\") == 24:\n            return f\"({a}{op1}({b}{op2}{c})){op3}{d}\"\n        if eval(f\"{a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d})\") == 24:\n            return f\"{a}{op1}(({b}{op2}{c}){op3}{d})\"\n        if eval(f\"{a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\") == 24:\n            return f\"{a}{op1}({b}{op2}({c}{op3}{d}))\"\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression_for_24(numbers):\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for nums in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nnumbers = [8, 9, 10, 13]\nsolution = find_expression_for_24(numbers)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find a valid expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 8, 9, 10, and 13. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((8 \\times 9) / (13 - 10)) = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((8*9)/(13-10))>>>"
