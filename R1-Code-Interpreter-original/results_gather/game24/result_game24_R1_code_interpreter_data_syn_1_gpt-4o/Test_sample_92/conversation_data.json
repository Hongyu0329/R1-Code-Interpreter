    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 5, 6, 11, and 13 to make 24, we need to explore different combinations of arithmetic operations. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 5, 6, 11, 13.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n3. We can try different combinations and operations to see which one results in 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- One possible approach is to try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and then adjust using the remaining numbers.\n- We can try using multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. Try using multiplication to get close to 24:\n   - 5 * 6 = 30, which is too high.\n   - 11 * 2 = 22, which is close to 24.\n\n2. Try using addition and subtraction:\n   - 13 - 11 = 2, which can be used to adjust other results.\n\n3. Try using division:\n   - 13 / 5 = 2.6, which is not useful directly.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works by using a systematic approach with code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [5, 6, 11, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code has successfully found multiple expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 5, 6, 11, and 13. The expressions are:\n\n1. \\((6-5) \\times (11+13)\\)\n2. \\((6-5) \\times (13+11)\\)\n3. \\((13-6) \\times (5-11)\\)\n\nThese expressions use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number, 24.\n\nThe first two expressions are essentially the same due to the commutative property of addition, and the third expression is a valid solution as well.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(6-5)*(11+13)>>>"
