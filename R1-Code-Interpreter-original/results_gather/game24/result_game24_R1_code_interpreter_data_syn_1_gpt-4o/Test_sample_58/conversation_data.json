    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 13, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the use of multiplication and division, as they can quickly change the magnitude of numbers.\n2. We can also consider using addition and subtraction to adjust the result to 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can try multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the others.\n- We can also try dividing one number by another and then using the result in further operations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [3, 7, 13, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a solution to the problem. The expression `(13/13) + (7*3)` evaluates to 24. \n\nLet's break down the expression:\n- `13/13` equals 1.\n- `7*3` equals 21.\n- Adding these results, `1 + 21` equals 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem using the numbers 3, 7, 13, and 13 is:\n\n<<<(13/13) + (7*3)>>>"
