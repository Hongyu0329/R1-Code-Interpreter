    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 8, and 9 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and see if they lead to 24.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if that helps.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n- We can also try to use multiplication and division to reach 24, as these operations can quickly increase or decrease the result.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using these numbers:\n\n- We can start by trying to multiply two numbers and then adjust with the others.\n- We can also try to add or subtract numbers to form a base and then multiply or divide to reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Try using multiplication and addition:\n   - (9 * 1) + (8 + 5) = 9 + 13 = 22 (close, but not 24)\n   \n2. Try using subtraction and multiplication:\n   - (9 - 5) * (8 - 1) = 4 * 7 = 28 (too high)\n\n3. Try using division and addition:\n   - (9 / 1) + (8 + 5) = 9 + 13 = 22 (close, but not 24)\n\n4. Try using a combination of operations:\n   - (9 + 5) - (8 / 1) = 14 - 8 = 6 (not close)\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using code to find a valid combination:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 5, 8, 9]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\")\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct expression.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 5, 8, and 9. Let's analyze these expressions:\n\n1. ((1-9)*(5-8)) = (-8) * (-3) = 24\n2. ((5-8)*(1-9)) = (-3) * (-8) = 24\n3. ((8-5)*(9-1)) = 3 * 8 = 24\n4. ((9-1)*(8-5)) = 8 * 3 = 24\n\nAll these expressions correctly use each number exactly once and result in 24. Therefore, any of these expressions can be considered a valid solution.\n\n<<<((8-5)*(9-1))>>>"
