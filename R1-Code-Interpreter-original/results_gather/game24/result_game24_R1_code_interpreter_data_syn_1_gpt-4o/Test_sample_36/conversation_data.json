    "To solve the problem of using the numbers 3, 8, 12, and 12 to obtain 24, we need to consider different combinations of arithmetic operations and groupings. The goal is to use each number exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number 24.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding and subtracting numbers in different ways.\n2. We can also try multiplying and dividing numbers.\n3. We need to consider the use of parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's start by testing some combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n- We can also consider using division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [3, 8, 12, 12]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        result = eval(expression)\n        # Check if the result is close to the target\n        if abs(result - target) < 1e-6:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        expr = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if expr:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThe code will try different permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to see if we can find a solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 3, 8, 12, and 12. Among these, the expression `((8+12)+(12/3))` is a valid solution. This expression uses each number exactly once and evaluates to 24.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the expression:\n- \\(8 + 12 = 20\\)\n- \\(12 / 3 = 4\\)\n- \\(20 + 4 = 24\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((8+12)+(12/3))>>>"
