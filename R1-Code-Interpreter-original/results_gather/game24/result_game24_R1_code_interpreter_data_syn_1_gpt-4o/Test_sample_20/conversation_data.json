    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 5, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 4, 5, 11, and 12.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering different operations and combinations of these numbers.\n- We can try multiplying two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 24.\n- We can also try adding or subtracting numbers and then see if multiplication or division can help reach 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- If we multiply 4 and 5, we get 20. We need to use 11 and 12 to get 4 more.\n- If we multiply 11 and 12, we get 132, which is too large.\n- If we add 11 and 12, we get 23, which is close to 24. We need to add 1 more using 4 and 5.\n\nLet's try using code to systematically check possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [4, 5, 11, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i+1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code output provides several combinations of operations on the numbers 4, 5, 11, and 12 that result in 24. However, we need to verify which of these combinations correctly use all four numbers and result in 24.\n\nUpon reviewing the output, the expression `(11 + 12) + (5 - 4)` correctly uses all four numbers and results in 24:\n\n- \\(11 + 12 = 23\\)\n- \\(5 - 4 = 1\\)\n- \\(23 + 1 = 24\\)\n\nThus, the correct expression is:\n\n<<<((11 + 12) + (5 - 4))>>>"
