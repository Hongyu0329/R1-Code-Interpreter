    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 6, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 6, 6, and 13.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n- We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach 24.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 6, 6, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression with the given numbers and operations\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and combinations of operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 6, 6, and 13. The first valid expression found is:\n\n((1-13)+(6*6))\n\nThis expression evaluates to 24 as follows:\n- Calculate \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n- Calculate \\(1 - 13 = -12\\)\n- Add the results: \\(-12 + 36 = 24\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((1-13)+(6*6))>>>"
