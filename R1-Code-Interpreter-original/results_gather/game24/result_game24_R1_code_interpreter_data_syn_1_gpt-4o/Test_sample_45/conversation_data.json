    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 7 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and groupings to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We need to consider the use of parentheses to change the order of operations.\n3. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- We can also consider using subtraction and division to adjust the result.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 1, 5, 7]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Try different parenthesis placements\n        expr1 = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n        expr2 = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})){ops[2]}{nums[3]}\"\n        expr3 = f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}(({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}){ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        expr4 = f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        expr5 = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        \n        for expr in [expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4, expr5]:\n            if eval(expr) == target:\n                return expr\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, checking if any combination results in 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 7. Among these, the expression `(1+1)*(5+7)` is a valid solution. This expression uses each number exactly once and evaluates to 24.\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n\n- \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(5 + 7 = 12\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\)\n\nThus, the expression `(1+1)*(5+7)` correctly evaluates to 24.\n\n<<<(1+1)*(5+7)>>>"
