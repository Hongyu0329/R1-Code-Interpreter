    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 4, 7, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and groupings to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We need to consider the order of operations (parentheses, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction).\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Try different groupings and operations to see if we can reach 24.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find a valid equation.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 4, 7, 8]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\")\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 4, 7, and 8. Let's verify one of these expressions to ensure it is correct:\n\n- One of the expressions is `((8*4)-(1+7))`.\n\nLet's evaluate this expression:\n\n1. Calculate \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\).\n2. Calculate \\(1 + 7 = 8\\).\n3. Subtract the results: \\(32 - 8 = 24\\).\n\nThis expression correctly evaluates to 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((8*4)-(1+7))>>>"
