    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and groupings to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We need to consider the order of operations (parentheses, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction).\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- One possible approach is to try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using code to automate the process of checking different combinations and operations:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression with the given numbers and operations\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # All possible operations\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of numbers and operations\n    for num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n            if result == 24:\n                # Format the expression as a string\n                expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n                return expression\n    return None\n\nnumbers = [3, 8, 11, 12]\nexpression = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(expression)\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute it to see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code successfully found a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12. The expression is \\((12-11) \\times (3 \\times 8)\\).\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<(12-11)*(3*8)>>>"
