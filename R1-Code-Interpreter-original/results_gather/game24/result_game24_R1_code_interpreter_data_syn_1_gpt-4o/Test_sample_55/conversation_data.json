    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 10, 10, and 10 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We have three 10s and one 6. A potential approach is to use multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24.\n2. We can try to form intermediate results that are close to 24 and adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- We can start by multiplying two 10s: \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\).\n- Then, we can subtract 6: \\(100 - 6 = 94\\).\n- Finally, we can divide by the remaining 10: \\(94 / 10 = 9.4\\).\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another one:\n\n- We can add two 10s: \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n- Then, add the remaining 10: \\(20 + 10 = 30\\).\n- Finally, subtract 6: \\(30 - 6 = 24\\).\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify it with a Python script to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Using the numbers 6, 10, 10, 10 to form 24\nresult = (10 + 10 + 10) - 6\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms that the equation \\((10 + 10 + 10) - 6 = 24\\) is correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((10 + 10 + 10) - 6)>>>"
