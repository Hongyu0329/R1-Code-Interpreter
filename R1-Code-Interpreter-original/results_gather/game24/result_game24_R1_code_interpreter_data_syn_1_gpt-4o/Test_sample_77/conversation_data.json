    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 8, 8, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 8, 8, and 11.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering the largest number, 11, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n- We can try different combinations of operations and numbers to see if we can reach 24.\n\nLet's try some combinations manually:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication and addition:\n   - If we multiply 8 by 3, we get 24. So, we need to form 3 using the remaining numbers: 1, 8, and 11.\n   - We can form 3 by using (11 - 8).\n\n2. Let's verify this:\n   - (11 - 8) = 3\n   - 8 * 3 = 24\n\nThis seems to work. Let's write this in a proper equation format:\n\n- ((11 - 8) * 8) = 24\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na, b, c, d = 1, 8, 8, 11\n\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (d - b) * b\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms that the calculation is correct. The expression \\(((11 - 8) * 8)\\) indeed results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((11 - 8) * 8)>>>"
