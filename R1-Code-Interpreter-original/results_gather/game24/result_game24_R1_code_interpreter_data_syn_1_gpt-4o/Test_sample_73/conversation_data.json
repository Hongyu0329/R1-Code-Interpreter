    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 6, 6, and 8 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in various combinations.\n2. We need to ensure that the operations are performed in such a way that the result is exactly 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and achieve the desired result.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works by testing different arithmetic operations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Consider using division to adjust the result if it becomes too large.\n- Use subtraction to decrease the result if necessary.\n\nLet's write a Python script to test different combinations and find a valid equation that results in 24.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [2, 6, 6, 8]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression with the given numbers and operations\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        result = eval(expression)\n        # Check if the result is equal to the target\n        if result == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and combinations of operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        expr = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if expr:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple valid expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 2, 6, 6, and 8. The expression `((2*6)*(8-6))` is one such solution.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer based on the valid expression found:\n\n<<<((2*6)*(8-6))>>>"
