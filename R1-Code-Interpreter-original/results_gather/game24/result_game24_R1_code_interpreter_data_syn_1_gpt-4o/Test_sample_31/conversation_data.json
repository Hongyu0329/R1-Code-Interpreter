    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 10, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and groupings to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We need to consider the order of operations (parentheses, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction).\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by considering the sum of two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 24.\n- Consider using multiplication and division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- (3 + 11) = 14, then (10 - 8) = 2, and 14 + 2 = 16 (not 24)\n- (11 - 3) = 8, then (10 - 8) = 2, and 8 * 2 = 16 (not 24)\n- (11 + 3) = 14, then (10 - 8) = 2, and 14 - 2 = 12 (not 24)\n- (11 - 8) = 3, then (10 - 3) = 7, and 3 * 7 = 21 (not 24)\n\nLet's try using Python to automate the search for a valid combination:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [3, 8, 10, 11]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 3, 8, 10, and 11. The expression is:\n\n- \\((11 - 10) \\times 3 \\times 8\\)\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and results in 24.\n\n<<<(11 - 10) * 3 * 8>>>"
