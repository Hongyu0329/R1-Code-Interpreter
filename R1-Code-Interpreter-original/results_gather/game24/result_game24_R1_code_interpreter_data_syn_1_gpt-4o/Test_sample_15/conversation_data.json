    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 5, 5, 11, 12.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering different combinations of operations and see if they lead to 24.\n- We can try to use multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24, as these operations are more likely to reach a specific target number.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Try using multiplication and addition:\n   - (5 * 5) = 25, then 25 - 11 = 14, and 14 + 12 = 26 (not 24)\n2. Try using division and subtraction:\n   - (12 / 5) = 2.4, not useful as we need integers.\n3. Try using subtraction and addition:\n   - (11 + 5) = 16, then 16 + 5 = 21, and 21 + 12 = 33 (not 24)\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using Python to find the correct combination:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [5, 5, 11, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24, but they are repeated due to the permutations and combinations being checked multiple times. The correct expression that evaluates to 24 is:\n\n- (12 - 5) * 5 - 11\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and evaluates to 24. Let's verify:\n\n1. Calculate (12 - 5) = 7\n2. Multiply by 5: 7 * 5 = 35\n3. Subtract 11: 35 - 11 = 24\n\nThis confirms that the expression is correct.\n\n<<<(12 - 5) * 5 - 11>>>"
