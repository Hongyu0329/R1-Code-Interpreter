    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 2, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n2. Since 12 is half of 24, we can consider multiplying 12 by 2 to get 24. However, we have three 2s, so we need to use them effectively.\n3. We can try to form an expression that uses multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can multiply 12 by 2 to get 24, but we need to use all numbers.\n- We can try using the other two 2s in a way that doesn't affect the result of 24.\n\nLet's write a Python script to test different combinations and see if we can find a valid equation.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [2, 2, 2, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that equals 24. Let's see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24, but we need to select one valid expression that uses each number exactly once. The expression `(2+2)*(12/2)` evaluates to 24 and uses each number exactly once.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n- Calculate \\(2 + 2 = 4\\).\n- Calculate \\(12 / 2 = 6\\).\n- Multiply the results: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\nThis expression is valid and meets the criteria.\n\n<<<(2+2)*(12/2)>>>"
