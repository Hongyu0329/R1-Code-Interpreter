    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 4, and 6 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and groupings to see if we can reach 24.\n2. We need to consider the use of parentheses to change the order of operations.\n3. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to increase the value to 24.\n- We can also consider using division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's write a Python script to systematically try different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 1, 4, 6]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression with the given numbers and operations\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            # Construct the expression string\n            expression = f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 1, 4, and 6. The expressions are:\n\n1. \\((1-1)+(4*6)\\)\n2. \\((1-1)+(6*4)\\)\n3. \\((1*4)*(1*6)\\)\n4. \\((1*4)*(6*1)\\)\n5. \\((1*6)*(1*4)\\)\n6. \\((1*6)*(4*1)\\)\n7. \\((4*1)*(1*6)\\)\n8. \\((4*1)*(6*1)\\)\n9. \\((4*6)+(1-1)\\)\n10. \\((6*1)*(1*4)\\)\n11. \\((6*1)*(4*1)\\)\n12. \\((6*4)+(1-1)\\)\n\nAll these expressions correctly use each number exactly once and evaluate to 24. \n\nLet's choose one of these expressions as the final answer. I'll select the first one for simplicity:\n\n<<<((1-1)+(4*6))>>>"
