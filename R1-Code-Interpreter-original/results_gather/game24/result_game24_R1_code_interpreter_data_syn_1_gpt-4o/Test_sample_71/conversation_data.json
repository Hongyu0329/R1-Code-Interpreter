    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 8, 9, 11, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. We need to consider the order of operations (parentheses) to ensure the correct calculation.\n3. We can use a brute force approach to try different combinations and operations to see if we can achieve the result of 24.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find a solution.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    # Evaluate the expression with the given numbers and operations\n    try:\n        result = eval(f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\")\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression_to_24(numbers):\n    # All possible operations\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of numbers and operations\n    for num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == 24:\n                return f\"(({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}))\"\n    return None\n\nnumbers = [8, 9, 11, 12]\nexpression = find_expression_to_24(numbers)\nprint(expression)\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found an expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 8, 9, 11, and 12. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((9 - 8) + (11 + 12)) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and follows the order of operations correctly.\n\n<<<((9-8)+(11+12))>>>"
