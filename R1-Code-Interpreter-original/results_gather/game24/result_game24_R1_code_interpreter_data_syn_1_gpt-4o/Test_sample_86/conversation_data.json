    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 6 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value.\n2. We can also consider using division to adjust the values if they become too large.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- Start with multiplication: 5 * 5 = 25, which is close to 24. We can then try to adjust this with the remaining numbers.\n- Consider using 6 and 3 in a way that can adjust the result of 25 to 24.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- One possible approach is to use division to reduce the result of multiplication:\n  - (5 * 5) = 25\n  - 25 - 6 = 19\n  - 19 + 3 = 22 (not 24)\n\n- Another approach is to use addition and multiplication:\n  - (5 + 5) = 10\n  - 10 * 3 = 30\n  - 30 - 6 = 24\n\nThis seems to work. Let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Verify the calculation\nresult = (5 + 5) * 3 - 6\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The calculation is correct. The expression \\((5 + 5) \\times 3 - 6\\) equals 24. Therefore, the solution to the problem using the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 6 is:\n\n<<<((5 + 5) * 3 - 6)>>>"
