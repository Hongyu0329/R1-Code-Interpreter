    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 5, 9, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 5, 9, and 12.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 24.\n3. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nWe can try different combinations and operations to see if we can achieve the target number 24. Let's try to find a solution by testing different arithmetic operations and combinations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [2, 5, 9, 12]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        result = eval(expression)\n        # Check if the result is equal to the target\n        if result == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        expr = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if expr:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThe code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 2, 5, 9, and 12. However, the expressions are not correctly evaluated to 24 due to a mistake in the logic or evaluation process. Let's analyze the results and find the correct expression.\n\nUpon reviewing the expressions, it seems there was an oversight in the evaluation logic. Let's manually verify and find the correct expression:\n\n1. We need to ensure that the operations and order of operations are correctly applied to achieve 24.\n2. Let's try to manually construct an expression that evaluates to 24.\n\nAfter analyzing the possibilities, one correct expression is:\n\n- \\((5 - 2) \\times (9 - 5) = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n\nThis doesn't give us 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- \\((5 \\times 2) + (12 - 9) = 10 + 3 = 13\\)\n\nThis also doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- \\((9 - 5) \\times (12 - 2) = 4 \\times 10 = 40\\)\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- \\((12 - 9) \\times (5 + 2) = 3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n\nThis doesn't work either.
