    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 7, 12, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have two 12s, which can be useful for multiplication or addition to reach higher numbers.\n2. The number 6 can be used to divide or multiply to adjust the result.\n3. The number 7 can be used similarly to 6.\n\nWe need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that result in 24. Let's try to find a solution by testing different combinations and operations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and operations\nnumbers = [6, 7, 12, 12]\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        result = eval(expression)\n        # Check if the result is 24\n        if result == 24:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        expr = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if expr:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThe code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid expression that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 6, 7, 12, and 12. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((7-6) \\times (12+12)) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and results in 24. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((7-6)*(12+12))>>>"
