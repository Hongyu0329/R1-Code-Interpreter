    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 8, 10, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 8, 10, and 11.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering different operations and combinations of these numbers.\n- One approach is to try to form intermediate results that can be combined to make 24.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- Consider using multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and then adjusting with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Try using multiplication to get close to 24:\n   - 2 * 11 = 22, then 22 + 2 = 24 (but we used 2 twice, which is not allowed)\n   - 8 * 2 = 16, then 16 + 8 = 24 (but we used 8 twice, which is not allowed)\n\n2. Try using division to adjust values:\n   - 10 / 2 = 5, then 5 * 8 = 40, then 40 - 16 = 24 (but we used 8 twice, which is not allowed)\n\n3. Try using subtraction to adjust values:\n   - 11 - 8 = 3, then 3 * 8 = 24 (but we used 8 twice, which is not allowed)\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using Python to find a valid combination:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [2, 8, 10, 11]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression.",
    "The code output provides several expressions, but we need to verify which one correctly evaluates to 24 using the numbers 2, 8, 10, and 11.
