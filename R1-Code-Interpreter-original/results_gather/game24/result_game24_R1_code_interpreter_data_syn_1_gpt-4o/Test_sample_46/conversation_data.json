    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n2. We can also consider addition and subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- If we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24. However, we still need to use 1 and 3.\n- If we multiply 3 by 8, we get 24. We can get 8 by adding 2 and 6, but we don't have 6.\n- If we multiply 12 by 1, we get 12, and then we can add 12 more to get 24, but we need to use 2 and 3.\n\nLet's try using Python to systematically explore combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 12. Among these, the expression `(1+3)*(12/2)` is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(1+3)*(12/2)>>>"
