    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 7, 10, and 12 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try different operations and see if they lead to 24.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if that helps.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 12, and see if it can be used effectively.\n- Try using addition and subtraction to balance the numbers.\n- Consider multiplication and division to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate the search for a valid expression:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [5, 7, 10, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions, but we need to identify the one that evaluates to 24. Let's analyze the results:\n\n- The expression `((5+7)*(12-10))` evaluates to 24 because:\n  - \\(5 + 7 = 12\\)\n  - \\(12 - 10 = 2\\)\n  - \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\)\n\nThis expression correctly uses each number once and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((5+7)*(12-10))>>>"
