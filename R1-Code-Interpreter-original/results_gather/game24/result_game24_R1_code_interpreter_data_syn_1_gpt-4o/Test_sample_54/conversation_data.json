    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 9 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value.\n2. We can also consider using division to reduce the numbers if needed.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition:\n  - \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\), then \\(27 - 9 = 18\\), and \\(18 + 7 = 25\\) (not 24).\n  - \\(9 + 9 = 18\\), then \\(18 - 7 = 11\\), and \\(11 \\times 3 = 33\\) (not 24).\n  - \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\), then \\(63 / 9 = 7\\), and \\(7 + 3 = 10\\) (not 24).\n\n- Consider using division and subtraction:\n  - \\(9 / 9 = 1\\), then \\(1 + 3 = 4\\), and \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\) (not 24).\n  - \\(9 - 3 = 6\\), then \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\), and \\(42 / 9 = 4.67\\) (not 24).\n\n- Try using a combination of operations:\n  - \\(9 + 9 = 18\\), then \\(18 - 7 = 11\\), and \\(11 + 3 = 14\\) (not 24).\n  - \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\), then \\(27 - 7 = 20\\), and \\(20 + 9 = 29\\) (not 24).\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using Python to explore all possible combinations and operations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [3, 7, 9, 9]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}){ops[1]}({num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]})\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 9. The expression `(7*9)+(9/3)` is one of the valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(7*9)+(9/3)>>>"
