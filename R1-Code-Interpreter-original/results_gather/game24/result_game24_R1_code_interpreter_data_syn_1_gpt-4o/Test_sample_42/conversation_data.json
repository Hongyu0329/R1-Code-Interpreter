    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 5, 5, and 12 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value.\n2. We can also consider using division to adjust the values if they become too large.\n\nLet's start by considering the largest number, 12, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n\n- One approach is to see if we can form a product or sum that, when combined with 12, results in 24.\n- Another approach is to see if we can form a smaller number with 1, 5, and 5, and then use multiplication or addition with 12 to reach 24.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication with 12:\n   - If we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24. So, we need to form 2 using 1, 5, and 5.\n   - We can form 2 by using (5 - 5) + 1 = 1, but this doesn't help directly.\n\n2. Consider using addition with 12:\n   - If we add 12 to another number, we need to form 12 using 1, 5, and 5.\n   - We can form 12 by using 5 + 5 + 1 + 1, but this doesn't use all numbers correctly.\n\n3. Consider using subtraction or division:\n   - We can try forming a number that, when subtracted from or divided into 12, results in 24.\n\nLet's try a systematic approach using code to explore these possibilities:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [1, 5, 5, 12]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression."
