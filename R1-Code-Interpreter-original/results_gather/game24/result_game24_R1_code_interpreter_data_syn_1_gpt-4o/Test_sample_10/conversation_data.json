    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 5, and 5 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's explore possible combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try to form 24 by using multiplication and addition, as these operations can increase the value quickly.\n2. We can also consider using division to adjust the values if needed.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- We can start by multiplying two numbers and then see if we can adjust the result with the remaining numbers.\n- We can also try adding or subtracting numbers first and then multiply or divide.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. \\( (5 \\times 5) - (1 + 1) = 25 - 2 = 23 \\) (close, but not 24)\n2. \\( (5 \\times 5) - 1 + 1 = 25 - 1 + 1 = 25 \\) (not 24)\n3. \\( (5 + 5) \\times (1 + 1) = 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) (not 24)\n4. \\( (5 \\times 5) - 1 - 1 = 25 - 1 - 1 = 23 \\) (close, but not 24)\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n1. \\( (5 \\times 5) - (1 / 1) = 25 - 1 = 24 \\)\n\nThis seems to work. Let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Verify the calculation\nresult = (5 * 5) - (1 / 1)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm if the calculation is correct. Once verified, we can provide the final answer.",
    "The code output confirms that the calculation is correct. The expression \\((5 \\times 5) - (1 / 1) = 24\\) is valid and uses each number exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<((5 * 5) - (1 / 1))>>>"
