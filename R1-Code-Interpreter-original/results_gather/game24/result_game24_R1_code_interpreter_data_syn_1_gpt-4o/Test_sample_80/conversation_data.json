    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 2, 10, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 2, 10, and 13.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n- One approach is to try to form a multiplication or addition that gets us close to 24, then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- If we try to use multiplication, we can consider:\n  - 2 * 10 = 20, then we need 4 more to reach 24.\n  - We can use the remaining 2 and 13 to adjust.\n\nLet's try to find a valid equation:\n\n```python\n# Let's try different combinations to find a valid equation\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [2, 2, 10, 13]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Form the expression as a string\n        expression = f\"(({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]}))\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n    return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid equation.",
    "The code has found a valid equation that evaluates to 24 using the numbers 2, 2, 10, and 13. The equation is:\n\n\\[\n((2/2) + (10 + 13)) = 24\n\\]\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and achieves the target value of 24.\n\n<<<((2/2) + (10 + 13))>>>"
