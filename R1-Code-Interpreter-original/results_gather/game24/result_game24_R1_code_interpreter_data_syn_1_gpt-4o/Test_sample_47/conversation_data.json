    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 8, 10, and 13 with basic arithmetic operations to obtain the result of 24. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 8, 10, 13.\n2. We need to use these numbers with operations (+, -, *, /) to get 24.\n3. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can start by considering the largest number, 13, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 24.\n- One possible approach is to try to form a multiplication or addition that results in 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- If we try to use multiplication, we can consider:\n  - 13 * 1 = 13, which is too low.\n  - 13 * 2 = 26, which is too high.\n  - 13 + 10 = 23, which is close to 24.\n\nLet's try to adjust the numbers to reach 24:\n\n- We can try: (13 + 10) - (8 - 1) = 24\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n- 13 + 10 = 23\n- 8 - 1 = 7\n- 23 - 7 = 16, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (13 - 1) + (10 - 8) = 24\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n- 13 - 1 = 12\n- 10 - 8 = 2\n- 12 + 2 = 14, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (13 - (10 - (8 + 1))) = 24\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n- 8 + 1 = 9\n- 10 - 9 = 1\n- 13 - 1 = 12, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (13 - 10) * (8 - 1) = 24\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n- 13 - 10 = 3\n- 8 - 1 = 7\n- 3 * 7 = 21, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (13 - 8) * (10 - 1) = 24\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n- 13 - 8 = 5\n- 10 - 1 = 9\n- 5 * 9 = 45, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (13 - 10) * (8 + 1) = 24\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n- 13 - 10 = 3\n- 8 + 1 = 9\n- 3 * 9 = 27, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- We can try: (13 - 1) * (10 - 8) = 24\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n- 13 - 1 = 12\n- 10 - 8 = 2\n- 12 * 2 = 24, which is correct.\n\nThis combination works. Let's finalize the answer.\n\n<<<((13 - 1) * (10 - 8)) = 24>>>"
