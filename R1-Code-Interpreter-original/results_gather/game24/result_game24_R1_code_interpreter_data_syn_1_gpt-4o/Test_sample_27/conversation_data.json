    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13 to form an equation that equals 24. Each number must be used exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have three 13s and one 11.\n2. We need to find a combination of operations that will result in 24.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's try to find a solution by considering different combinations and operations:\n\n- We can try to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to see if we can reach 24.\n- Since we have three 13s, we might consider using multiplication or addition to combine them in a way that can be adjusted with the 11.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. If we add two 13s: 13 + 13 = 26\n2. If we subtract 11 from 26: 26 - 11 = 15\n3. We still have one 13 left, and we need to reach 24.\n\nAlternatively, let's try using multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply two 13s: 13 * 13 = 169\n2. This is too large, so let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n1. Divide 13 by 13: 13 / 13 = 1\n2. Now we have 11, 13, and 1.\n3. Add 11 and 13: 11 + 13 = 24\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify it with a code script to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [11, 13, 13, 13]\n\n# Calculate the result using the identified approach\nresult = (11 + 13) + (13 / 13)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that the approach I used was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem and try a different combination of operations to achieve the target of 24.\n\nGiven the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13, let's try another approach:\n\n1. Consider using subtraction and addition in a different order.\n2. We can try subtracting one of the 13s from another 13, and then see how we can use the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try this manually:\n\n1. Subtract one 13 from another: 13 - 13 = 0\n2. Now we have 11, 13, and 0.\n3. Add 11 and 13: 11 + 13 = 24\n\nThis approach seems to work. Let's verify it with a code script to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [11, 13, 13, 13]\n\n# Calculate the result using the identified approach\nresult = (11 + 13) + (13 - 13)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the solution.",
    "The code output is correct, and it confirms that the approach works. The correct equation using the numbers 11, 13, 13, and 13 to achieve 24 is:\n\n\\[\n(11 + 13) + (13 - 13) = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(11 + 13) + (13 - 13)>>>"
