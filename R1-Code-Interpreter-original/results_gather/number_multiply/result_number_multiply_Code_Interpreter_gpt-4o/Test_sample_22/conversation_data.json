Let's solve it manually:\n\nThe expression is \\(3 \\times (-190) \\times (-8028)\\).\n\n1. First, calculate \\(-190 \\times -8028\\):\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - \\(190 \\times 8028 = 1,525,320\\).\n\n2. Now, multiply the result by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 1,525,320 = 4,575,960\\).\n\nSo, the result of \\(3 \\times -190 \\times -8028\\) is \\(4,575,960\\)."
