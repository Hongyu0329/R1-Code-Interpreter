Let's try to solve it manually.\n\nThe expression is \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\).\n\n1. First, calculate \\(5 \\times -69 = -345\\).\n2. Then, multiply the result by 90: \\(-345 \\times 90 = -31050\\).\n3. Finally, multiply by \\(-9786\\): \\(-31050 \\times -9786\\).\n\nLet's calculate the final step manually.# Calculating the final step manually: -31050 * -9786\nfinal_result = -31050 * -9786\nfinal_result\nassistant > It seems there is a persistent issue with executing the calculation. Let's break it down further:\n\nThe final step is \\(-31050 \\times -9786\\).\n\nSince both numbers are negative, their product will be positive. Let's calculate it manually:\n\n1. Multiply the absolute values: \\(31050 \\times 9786\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n\n- \\(31050 \\times 9786 = 31050 \\times (9000 + 700 + 80 + 6)\\)\n- \\(= 31050 \\times 9000 + 31050 \\times 700 + 31050 \\times 80 + 31050 \\times 6\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate each term:\n\n1. \\(31050 \\times 9000 = 279450000\\)\n2. \\(31050 \\times 700 = 21735000\\)\n3. \\(31050 \\times 80 = 2484000\\)\n4. \\(31050 \\times 6 = 186300\\)\n\nFinally, add them together:\n\n\\[279450000 + 21735000 + 2484000 + 186300\\]\n\nLet's calculate this sum.# Calculating the sum of the individual products\nsum_result = 279450000 + 21735000 + 2484000 + 186300\nsum_result\nassistant > It seems there is a persistent issue with executing calculations. Let's manually add the values:\n\n1. \\(279450000\\)\n2. \\(+ 21735000\\)\n3. \\(+ 2484000\\)\n4. \\(+ 186300\\)\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n- \\(279450000 + 21735000 = 301185000\\)\n- \\(301185000 + 2484000 = 303669000\\)\n- \\(303669000 + 186300 = 303855300\\)\n\nSo, the result of \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\) is \\(303,855,300\\)."
