Let's try to solve it manually:\n\nTo calculate \\(8 \\times 939 \\times -8489\\):\n\n1. First, calculate \\(8 \\times 939\\).\n2. Then, multiply the result by \\(-8489\\).\n\nLet's do the first step:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 939 = 7512 \\]\n\nNow, multiply this result by \\(-8489\\):\n\n\\[ 7512 \\times -8489 = -637,751,568 \\]\n\nSo, the result of \\(8 \\times 939 \\times -8489\\) is \\(-637,751,568\\)."
