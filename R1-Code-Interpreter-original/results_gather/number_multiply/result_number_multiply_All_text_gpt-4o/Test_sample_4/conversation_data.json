    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze and perform the arithmetic operations step by step. The expression given is \\(3 \\times 11 \\times -1221\\).\n\n1. **Identify the Operations**: The expression involves multiplication of three numbers: 3, 11, and -1221.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can perform the operations in any order. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: \n   - Multiply the first two numbers: \\(3 \\times 11\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**:\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number: \\(33 \\times -1221\\).\n   - Calculation: \n     - First, calculate \\(33 \\times 1221\\) without considering the sign:\n       - \\(33 \\times 1221 = 33 \\times (1200 + 21)\\).\n       - Break it down further:\n         - \\(33 \\times 1200 = 39600\\).\n         - \\(33 \\times 21 = 693\\).\n       - Add these results: \\(39600 + 693 = 40293\\).\n     - Now, apply the negative sign: \\(33 \\times -1221 = -40293\\).\n\n5. **Final Result**: The result of the expression \\(3 \\times 11 \\times -1221\\) is \\(-40293\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(-40293\\)."
