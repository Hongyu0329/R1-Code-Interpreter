    "To solve the expression \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\), we need to follow the order of operations and carefully consider the signs of the numbers involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 5, -69, 90, and -9786.\n   - The signs are positive for 5 and 90, and negative for -69 and -9786.\n\n2. **Understand the effect of multiplying negative numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative product.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Multiply the first two numbers: \\(5 \\times -69\\).\n     - Since one number is positive and the other is negative, the result will be negative.\n     - \\(5 \\times -69 = -345\\).\n\n   - **Step 2:** Multiply the result by the next number: \\(-345 \\times 90\\).\n     - Again, one number is negative and the other is positive, so the result will be negative.\n     - \\(-345 \\times 90 = -31050\\).\n\n   - **Step 3:** Multiply the result by the last number: \\(-31050 \\times -9786\\).\n     - Both numbers are negative, so the result will be positive.\n     - \\(-31050 \\times -9786 = 303843300\\).\n\n4. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\) is 303843300.\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression is 303843300."
