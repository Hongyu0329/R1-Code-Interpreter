    "To solve the problem \\(-8 \\times -99 \\times -19 \\times 4872\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of negative and positive numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-8\\), \\(-99\\), \\(-19\\), and \\(4872\\).\n   - There are three negative numbers and one positive number.\n\n2. **Understand the effect of multiplying negative numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - Since there are three negative numbers, the product of these numbers will be negative. This is because:\n     - \\((-8) \\times (-99)\\) results in a positive number.\n     - The positive result from the first multiplication, when multiplied by \\(-19\\), results in a negative number.\n     - Finally, multiplying this negative result by the positive number \\(4872\\) will result in a negative number.\n\n4. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     - \\(|-8| = 8\\)\n     - \\(|-99| = 99\\)\n     - \\(|-19| = 19\\)\n     - The absolute value of \\(4872\\) is \\(4872\\).\n\n5. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the absolute values step by step:\n     - \\(8 \\times 99 = 792\\)\n     - \\(792 \\times 19 = 15048\\)\n     - \\(15048 \\times 4872 = 73393456\\)\n\n6. **Apply the sign to the final product:**\n   - Since the overall sign of the product is negative, the final result is \\(-73393456\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-8 \\times -99 \\times -19 \\times 4872\\) is \\(-73393456\\)."
