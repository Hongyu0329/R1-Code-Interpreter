    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(8 \\times 881 \\times -7297\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 8, 881, and -7297. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which we perform the multiplication does not affect the result. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 881\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(8 \\times 881\\):\n     - \\(8 \\times 881 = 7048\\)\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number:\n   \\[\n   7048 \\times -7297\n   \\]\n   - Since one of the numbers is negative, the result will be negative.\n   - Calculate \\(7048 \\times 7297\\):\n     - This is a straightforward multiplication, but it involves large numbers. The exact calculation is:\n     - \\(7048 \\times 7297 = 514,046,056\\)\n\n5. **Apply the Sign**: Since we are multiplying by a negative number, the final result will be negative:\n   \\[\n   7048 \\times -7297 = -514,046,056\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Result**: The result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 881 \\times -7297\\) is \\(-514,046,056\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n-514,046,056"
