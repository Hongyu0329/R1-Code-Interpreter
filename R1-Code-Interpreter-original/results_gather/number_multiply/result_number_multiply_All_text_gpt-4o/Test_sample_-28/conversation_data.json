    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(8 \\times 939 \\times -8489\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 8, 939, and -8489. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can perform the operations in any order. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 939\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(8 \\times 939\\):\n     - \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\)\n     - Add the results with appropriate place values:\n       - \\(8 \\times 939 = 7512\\)\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number:\n   \\[\n   7512 \\times -8489\n   \\]\n   - Since one of the numbers is negative, the result will be negative.\n   - Calculate \\(7512 \\times 8489\\) without considering the sign first:\n     - This is a straightforward multiplication of two numbers, which can be done using long multiplication or a calculator.\n     - The result of \\(7512 \\times 8489\\) is 637,623,768.\n\n5. **Apply the Sign**: Since we are multiplying by a negative number, the final result will be negative:\n   \\[\n   7512 \\times -8489 = -637,623,768\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer**: The result of \\(8 \\times 939 \\times -8489\\) is \\(-637,623,768\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(-637,623,768\\)"
