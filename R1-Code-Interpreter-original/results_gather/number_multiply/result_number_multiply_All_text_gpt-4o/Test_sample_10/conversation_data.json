    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-5 \\times 80 \\times 8674\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression given is a multiplication of three numbers: \\(-5\\), \\(80\\), and \\(8674\\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: In multiplication, the order in which you multiply numbers does not affect the result due to the commutative property of multiplication. Therefore, we can multiply these numbers in any order.\n\n3. **Multiply the First Two Numbers**: \n   - Start by multiplying the first two numbers: \\(-5\\) and \\(80\\).\n   - \\(-5 \\times 80 = -400\\).\n   - The result is negative because a negative number multiplied by a positive number yields a negative result.\n\n4. **Multiply the Result with the Third Number**:\n   - Now, take the result from the previous step, \\(-400\\), and multiply it by the third number, \\(8674\\).\n   - \\(-400 \\times 8674\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\(400 \\times 8674\\) without considering the sign:\n     - Break it down into smaller parts if necessary, or use direct multiplication.\n     - \\(400 \\times 8674 = 3,469,600\\).\n   - Since the original multiplication involved a negative number, the final result will be negative.\n   - Therefore, \\(-400 \\times 8674 = -3,469,600\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The result of the expression \\(-5 \\times 80 \\times 8674\\) is \\(-3,469,600\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(-3,469,600\\)"
