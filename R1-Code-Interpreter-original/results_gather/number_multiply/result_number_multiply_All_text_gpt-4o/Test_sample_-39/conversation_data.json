    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(4 \\times 120 \\times -4430\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   - The expression given is \\(4 \\times 120 \\times -4430\\).\n   - This involves multiplying three numbers: 4, 120, and -4430.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:**\n   - According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication is performed from left to right.\n   - Therefore, we will first multiply 4 and 120, and then multiply the result by -4430.\n\n3. **First Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate \\(4 \\times 120\\).\n   - \\(4 \\times 120 = 480\\).\n\n4. **Second Multiplication:**\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by -4430.\n   - Calculate \\(480 \\times -4430\\).\n\n5. **Handling Negative Numbers:**\n   - When multiplying a positive number by a negative number, the result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result of \\(480 \\times -4430\\) will be negative.\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate \\(480 \\times 4430\\) first, ignoring the negative sign for now.\n   - Break it down further if needed:\n     - \\(480 \\times 4430 = 480 \\times (4000 + 430)\\).\n     - \\(480 \\times 4000 = 1,920,000\\).\n     - \\(480 \\times 430 = 206,400\\).\n     - Add these two results: \\(1,920,000 + 206,400 = 2,126,400\\).\n\n7. **Apply the Negative Sign:**\n   - Since we are multiplying by -4430, the final result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result is \\(-2,126,400\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of \\(4 \\times 120 \\times -4430\\) is \\(-2,126,400\\)."
