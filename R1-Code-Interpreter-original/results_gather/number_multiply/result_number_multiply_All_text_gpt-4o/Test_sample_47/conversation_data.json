    "To solve the problem \\(-6 \\times -36 \\times 37 \\times -9305\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of these numbers, especially focusing on the signs and the order of operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-6\\), \\(-36\\), \\(37\\), and \\(-9305\\).\n   - There are three negative numbers and one positive number.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying three negative numbers and one positive number will result in a negative product. This is because:\n     - \\((-6) \\times (-36)\\) is positive.\n     - The result of the above, when multiplied by \\(37\\), remains positive.\n     - Finally, multiplying the positive result by \\(-9305\\) results in a negative product.\n\n3. **Calculate the product step by step:**\n   - First, calculate \\((-6) \\times (-36)\\):\n     \\[\n     -6 \\times -36 = 216\n     \\]\n     This is positive because the product of two negative numbers is positive.\n\n   - Next, multiply the result by \\(37\\):\n     \\[\n     216 \\times 37 = 7992\n     \\]\n     This remains positive.\n\n   - Finally, multiply the result by \\(-9305\\):\n     \\[\n     7992 \\times -9305 = -74379960\n     \\]\n     This is negative because a positive number multiplied by a negative number is negative.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication \\(-6 \\times -36 \\times 37 \\times -9305\\) is \\(-74379960\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-6 \\times -36 \\times 37 \\times -9305\\) is \\(-74379960\\)."
