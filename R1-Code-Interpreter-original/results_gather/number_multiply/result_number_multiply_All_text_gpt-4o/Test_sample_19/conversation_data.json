    "To find the result of the multiplication \\(4 \\times 30 \\times 3248\\), we can break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply three numbers: 4, 30, and 3248.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply these numbers in any order. However, it might be easier to multiply the smaller numbers first.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(4 \\times 30\\).\n     - \\(4 \\times 30 = 120\\).\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(120 \\times 3248\\).\n\n4. **Break Down the Second Multiplication**:\n   - To simplify \\(120 \\times 3248\\), we can use the distributive property:\n     - \\(120 \\times 3248 = (100 + 20) \\times 3248\\).\n     - This can be expanded to: \\(100 \\times 3248 + 20 \\times 3248\\).\n\n5. **Calculate Each Part**:\n   - Calculate \\(100 \\times 3248\\):\n     - \\(100 \\times 3248 = 324800\\).\n   - Calculate \\(20 \\times 3248\\):\n     - \\(20 \\times 3248 = 64960\\).\n\n6. **Add the Results**:\n   - Add the two products from the previous step:\n     - \\(324800 + 64960 = 389760\\).\n\n7. **Final Result**: The result of \\(4 \\times 30 \\times 3248\\) is 389760.\n\nTherefore, the result of the multiplication \\(4 \\times 30 \\times 3248\\) is 389760."
