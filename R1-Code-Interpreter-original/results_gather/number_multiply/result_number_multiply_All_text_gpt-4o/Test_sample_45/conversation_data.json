    "To solve the expression \\(7 \\times -31 \\times 70 \\times -9705\\), we need to carefully analyze and compute the product step by step, taking into account the rules of multiplication, especially with negative numbers.\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 7, -31, 70, and -9705.\n   - The signs are positive for 7 and 70, and negative for -31 and -9705.\n\n2. **Understand the rules of multiplication with negative numbers:**\n   - The product of two numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative) is positive.\n   - The product of two numbers with different signs (one positive and one negative) is negative.\n\n3. **Calculate the product step by step:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Multiply the first two numbers: \\(7 \\times -31\\).\n     - Since one number is positive and the other is negative, the result will be negative.\n     - \\(7 \\times 31 = 217\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(7 \\times -31 = -217\\).\n\n   - **Step 2:** Multiply the result by the next number: \\(-217 \\times 70\\).\n     - Again, one number is negative and the other is positive, so the result will be negative.\n     - \\(217 \\times 70 = 15190\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(-217 \\times 70 = -15190\\).\n\n   - **Step 3:** Multiply the result by the last number: \\(-15190 \\times -9705\\).\n     - Both numbers are negative, so the result will be positive.\n     - Calculate the product: \\(15190 \\times 9705\\).\n\n4. **Perform the final multiplication:**\n\n   - To calculate \\(15190 \\times 9705\\), break it down:\n     - \\(15190 \\times 9705 = 15190 \\times (9700 + 5)\\).\n     - \\(15190 \\times 9700 = 147343000\\).\n     - \\(15190 \\times 5 = 75950\\).\n     - Add the two results: \\(147343000 + 75950 = 147418950\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\(7 \\times -31 \\times 70 \\times -9705\\) is \\(147418950\\).\n\n**Answer:** 147418950"
