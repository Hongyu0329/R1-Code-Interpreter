    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(4 \\times -97 \\times 9373\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   - The expression given is \\(4 \\times -97 \\times 9373\\).\n   - This involves multiplication of three numbers: 4, -97, and 9373.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:**\n   - Multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which we perform the multiplication does not affect the result.\n   - We can choose to multiply any two numbers first and then multiply the result by the third number.\n\n3. **Multiplication with Negative Numbers:**\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(4 \\times -97\\).\n     - \\(4 \\times -97 = -388\\).\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-388 \\times 9373\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(-388 \\times 9373\\):**\n   - Since \\(-388\\) is negative, the result of this multiplication will also be negative.\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     - \\(-388 \\times 9373 = -3636524\\).\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\(4 \\times -97 \\times 9373\\) is \\(-3636524\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe result of the expression \\(4 \\times -97 \\times 9373\\) is \\(-3636524\\)."
