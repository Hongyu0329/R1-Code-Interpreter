  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(3 \\times 245 \\times -5881\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 3, 245, and -5881. We need to multiply these numbers together.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply the numbers in any order. However, for simplicity, we will multiply them from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 245 = 735\n   \\]\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now, take the result from the first multiplication and multiply it by the third number:\n   \\[\n   735 \\times -5881\n   \\]\n\n5. **Sign Consideration**: Note that multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number. Therefore, the final result will be negative.\n\n6. **Calculate the Final Product**: Perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   735 \\times 5881 = 4,321,935\n   \\]\n\n7. **Apply the Negative Sign**: Since the multiplication involves a negative number, the final result is:\n   \\[\n   -4,321,935\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(3 \\times 245 \\times -5881\\) is \\(-4,321,935\\)."
