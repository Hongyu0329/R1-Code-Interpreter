    "To find the result of the multiplication \\(3 \\times 86 \\times 24 \\times 1020\\), we can break down the problem into smaller steps to make the calculation easier and more manageable. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Multiply the first two numbers:**\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 86\\).\n   - \\(3 \\times 86 = 258\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the result by the next number:**\n   - Now, multiply the result from step 1 by 24.\n   - \\(258 \\times 24\\).\n\n   To simplify this, break it down further:\n   - \\(258 \\times 24 = 258 \\times (20 + 4)\\).\n   - \\(258 \\times 20 = 5160\\).\n   - \\(258 \\times 4 = 1032\\).\n   - Add these two results: \\(5160 + 1032 = 6192\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the result by the last number:**\n   - Now, multiply the result from step 2 by 1020.\n   - \\(6192 \\times 1020\\).\n\n   Again, break it down:\n   - \\(6192 \\times 1020 = 6192 \\times (1000 + 20)\\).\n   - \\(6192 \\times 1000 = 6192000\\).\n   - \\(6192 \\times 20 = 123840\\).\n   - Add these two results: \\(6192000 + 123840 = 6315840\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of the multiplication \\(3 \\times 86 \\times 24 \\times 1020\\) is \\(6315840\\).\n\n**Final Answer: 6315840**"
