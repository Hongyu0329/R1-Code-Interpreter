    "To find the result of the multiplication \\(3 \\times 680 \\times 3102\\), we can break down the problem into smaller steps to ensure accuracy and clarity. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply three numbers: 3, 680, and 3102.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply these numbers in any order. However, for simplicity, we will multiply them from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 680 = 2040\n   \\]\n   - Multiply 3 by 680.\n   - 3 times 600 is 1800.\n   - 3 times 80 is 240.\n   - Add the two results: 1800 + 240 = 2040.\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now multiply the result by the third number:\n   \\[\n   2040 \\times 3102\n   \\]\n   - Break down the multiplication into parts:\n     - Multiply 2040 by 3000.\n     - Multiply 2040 by 100.\n     - Multiply 2040 by 2.\n   - Add these results together.\n\n5. **Detailed Multiplication**:\n   - \\(2040 \\times 3000 = 6120000\\)\n   - \\(2040 \\times 100 = 204000\\)\n   - \\(2040 \\times 2 = 4080\\)\n\n6. **Add the Results**:\n   - Add the three products together:\n   \\[\n   6120000 + 204000 + 4080 = 6328080\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final Result**: The result of multiplying 3, 680, and 3102 is 6,328,080.\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(3 \\times 680 \\times 3102\\) is 6,328,080."
