  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-9 \\times 43 \\times -73 \\times -6061\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of these numbers, especially focusing on the signs of the numbers involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-9\\), \\(43\\), \\(-73\\), and \\(-6061\\).\n   - The signs are negative, positive, negative, and negative, respectively.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - When multiplying numbers, the product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - The product of an even number of negative numbers is positive, while the product of an odd number of negative numbers is negative.\n   - Here, we have three negative numbers (\\(-9\\), \\(-73\\), and \\(-6061\\)), which is an odd number of negative factors. Therefore, the overall product will be negative.\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, multiply the absolute values of the numbers:\n     - \\(|-9| = 9\\)\n     - \\(|43| = 43\\)\n     - \\(|-73| = 73\\)\n     - \\(|-6061| = 6061\\)\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the numbers step by step:\n     - First, calculate \\(9 \\times 43 = 387\\).\n     - Next, multiply the result by 73: \\(387 \\times 73 = 28251\\).\n     - Finally, multiply the result by 6061: \\(28251 \\times 6061 = 171145311\\).\n\n5. **Apply the sign to the final result:**\n   - Since we determined that the overall sign of the product is negative, the final result is \\(-171145311\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-9 \\times 43 \\times -73 \\times -6061\\) is \\(-171145311\\)."
