    "To solve the problem \\(-3 \\times 20 \\times 30 \\times -9191\\), we need to carefully analyze and compute the expression step by step. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-3\\), \\(20\\), \\(30\\), and \\(-9191\\).\n   - The signs are negative for \\(-3\\) and \\(-9191\\), and positive for \\(20\\) and \\(30\\).\n\n2. **Understand the effect of multiplying negative numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-3 \\times 20\\).\n     - \\(-3 \\times 20 = -60\\).\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-60 \\times 30\\).\n     - \\(-60 \\times 30 = -1800\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-1800 \\times -9191\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, the result will be positive.\n     - \\(-1800 \\times -9191 = 1800 \\times 9191\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the final multiplication:**\n   - \\(1800 \\times 9191\\).\n   - Break it down for easier calculation:\n     - \\(1800 \\times 9191 = 1800 \\times (9000 + 191)\\).\n     - \\(1800 \\times 9000 = 16200000\\).\n     - \\(1800 \\times 191 = 343800\\).\n   - Add the two results together:\n     - \\(16200000 + 343800 = 16543800\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-3 \\times 20 \\times 30 \\times -9191\\) is \\(16543800\\).\n\n**Answer:** 16543800"
