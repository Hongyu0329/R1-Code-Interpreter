    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-5 \\times -79 \\times 57 \\times 8192\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply four numbers: \\(-5\\), \\(-79\\), \\(57\\), and \\(8192\\).\n\n2. **Consider the Signs**: \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying four numbers where two are negative will result in a positive number because:\n     - \\(-5 \\times -79\\) will be positive.\n     - The result of the above, when multiplied by \\(57\\), will remain positive.\n     - Finally, multiplying by \\(8192\\) will keep the result positive.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the two negative numbers: \n     \\[\n     -5 \\times -79 = 395\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the result by \\(57\\):\n     \\[\n     395 \\times 57 = 22,515\n     \\]\n   - Finally, multiply the result by \\(8192\\):\n     \\[\n     22,515 \\times 8192 = 184,528,896\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - Double-check each multiplication step to ensure accuracy.\n   - Ensure that the sign of the final result is positive, as reasoned earlier.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The result of the multiplication \\(-5 \\times -79 \\times 57 \\times 8192\\) is \\(184,528,896\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: 184,528,896"
