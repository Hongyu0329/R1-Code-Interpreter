    "To solve the expression \\(7 \\times -29 \\times -1186\\), we need to carefully analyze and compute the multiplication step by step, taking into account the properties of multiplication and the signs of the numbers involved.\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers and Signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 7, -29, and -1186.\n   - The signs are important: 7 is positive, -29 is negative, and -1186 is negative.\n\n2. **Understand the Effect of Multiplying Negative Numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(7 \\times -29\\).\n     - Since one number is positive and the other is negative, the result will be negative.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(7 \\times 29 = 203\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(7 \\times -29 = -203\\).\n\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-203 \\times -1186\\).\n     - Both numbers are negative, so the result will be positive.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(203 \\times 1186\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\(203 \\times 1186\\):**\n   - Break down the multiplication for easier calculation:\n     - \\(203 \\times 1186 = 203 \\times (1000 + 186)\\).\n     - Use the distributive property: \\(203 \\times 1000 + 203 \\times 186\\).\n     - Calculate each part:\n       - \\(203 \\times 1000 = 203000\\).\n       - \\(203 \\times 186\\) can be broken down further:\n         - \\(203 \\times 186 = 203 \\times (200 - 14)\\).\n         - \\(203 \\times 200 = 40600\\).\n         - \\(203 \\times 14 = 2842\\).\n         - Therefore, \\(203 \\times 186 = 40600 - 2842 = 37758\\).\n\n   - Add the results: \\(203000 + 37758 = 240758\\).\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of the entire expression \\(7 \\times -29 \\times -1186\\) is 240758.\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(7 \\times -29 \\times -1186\\) is 240758."
