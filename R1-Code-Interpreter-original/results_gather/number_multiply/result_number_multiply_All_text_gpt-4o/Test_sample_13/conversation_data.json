    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(5 \\times 68 \\times -2465\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 5, 68, and -2465. The operation involves multiplication of these three numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: In multiplication, the order in which you multiply numbers does not affect the result due to the commutative property of multiplication. Therefore, we can multiply in any order.\n\n3. **Multiply the First Two Numbers**: \n   - First, multiply 5 and 68.\n   - \\(5 \\times 68 = 340\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the Result with the Third Number**:\n   - Now, take the result from the first multiplication (340) and multiply it by -2465.\n   - \\(340 \\times -2465\\).\n\n5. **Consider the Sign**:\n   - Since we are multiplying a positive number (340) by a negative number (-2465), the result will be negative.\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(340 \\times 2465\\) first, ignoring the negative sign for now.\n   - Break down the multiplication for simplicity:\n     - \\(340 \\times 2465 = 340 \\times (2000 + 400 + 60 + 5)\\).\n     - \\(340 \\times 2000 = 680,000\\).\n     - \\(340 \\times 400 = 136,000\\).\n     - \\(340 \\times 60 = 20,400\\).\n     - \\(340 \\times 5 = 1,700\\).\n   - Add these results together:\n     - \\(680,000 + 136,000 + 20,400 + 1,700 = 838,100\\).\n\n7. **Apply the Negative Sign**:\n   - Since the original multiplication involved a negative number, the final result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result of \\(340 \\times -2465\\) is \\(-838,100\\).\n\nThe final answer to the expression \\(5 \\times 68 \\times -2465\\) is \\(-838,100\\)."
