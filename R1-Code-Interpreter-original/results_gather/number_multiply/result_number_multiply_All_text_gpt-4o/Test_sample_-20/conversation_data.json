    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-9 \\times 43 \\times -73 \\times -6061\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of these numbers, especially focusing on the signs of the numbers involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-9\\), \\(43\\), \\(-73\\), and \\(-6061\\).\n   - \\(-9\\) is negative.\n   - \\(43\\) is positive.\n   - \\(-73\\) is negative.\n   - \\(-6061\\) is negative.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative product.\n   - Therefore, we need to count the number of negative numbers:\n     - There are three negative numbers: \\(-9\\), \\(-73\\), and \\(-6061\\).\n   - An odd number of negative numbers will result in a negative product.\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     - \\(|-9| = 9\\)\n     - \\(|43| = 43\\)\n     - \\(|-73| = 73\\)\n     - \\(|-6061| = 6061\\)\n   - Multiply these absolute values step by step:\n     - \\(9 \\times 43 = 387\\)\n     - \\(387 \\times 73 = 28251\\)\n     - \\(28251 \\times 6061 = 171168711\\)\n\n4. **Apply the sign to the final product:**\n   - Since we determined that the product should be negative (due to the odd number of negative factors), the final result is \\(-171168711\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-9 \\times 43 \\times -73 \\times -6061\\) is \\(-171168711\\)."
