    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 14 \\times -63 \\times -2676\\), we need to carefully analyze and perform the multiplication step by step. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 8, 14, -63, and -2676.\n   - There are two negative numbers: -63 and -2676.\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.\n   - Therefore, the overall product will be positive because there are an even number of negative factors.\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Start by multiplying the first two numbers: \\(8 \\times 14\\).\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 14 = 112\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(112 \\times -63\\).\n     \\[\n     112 \\times -63 = -7056\n     \\]\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-7056 \\times -2676\\).\n     \\[\n     -7056 \\times -2676 = 18874356\n     \\]\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Ensure that each multiplication step is performed correctly.\n   - Double-check the sign of the final result, which should be positive due to the even number of negative factors.\n\nThe final result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 14 \\times -63 \\times -2676\\) is:\n\n18874356"
