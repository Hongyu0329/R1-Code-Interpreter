    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-2 \\times 626 \\times 7127\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Expression\nThe expression given is \\(-2 \\times 626 \\times 7127\\). This is a straightforward multiplication problem involving three numbers: \\(-2\\), \\(626\\), and \\(7127\\).\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Sign\n- The first number is \\(-2\\), which is negative.\n- The other two numbers, \\(626\\) and \\(7127\\), are positive.\n- Multiplying a negative number by a positive number results in a negative number.\n- Therefore, the final result will be negative.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Multiplication\nWe will perform the multiplication in two steps:\n\n#### Step 3.1: Multiply the First Two Numbers\n- Multiply \\(-2\\) by \\(626\\):\n  \\[\n  -2 \\times 626 = -1252\n  \\]\n  This result is negative because one of the numbers is negative.\n\n#### Step 3.2: Multiply the Result by the Third Number\n- Now, multiply \\(-1252\\) by \\(7127\\):\n  \\[\n  -1252 \\times 7127\n  \\]\n  To perform this multiplication, we can break it down further if needed, but for simplicity, let's calculate directly:\n  \\[\n  -1252 \\times 7127 = -8925804\n  \\]\n  Again, the result is negative because we are multiplying a negative number by a positive number.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe final result of the expression \\(-2 \\times 626 \\times 7127\\) is \\(-8925804\\).\n\n**Answer: -8925804**"
