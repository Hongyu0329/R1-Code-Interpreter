    "To find the result of the multiplication \\(3 \\times 680 \\times 3102\\), we can break down the problem into smaller steps to ensure accuracy and clarity. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply three numbers: 3, 680, and 3102.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply these numbers in any order. However, for simplicity, we will multiply them from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 680\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 680\\):\n     - \\(3 \\times 600 = 1800\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 80 = 240\\)\n     - Add the results: \\(1800 + 240 = 2040\\)\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number:\n   \\[\n   2040 \\times 3102\n   \\]\n   - Break down the multiplication:\n     - \\(2040 \\times 3000 = 6120000\\)\n     - \\(2040 \\times 100 = 204000\\)\n     - \\(2040 \\times 2 = 4080\\)\n   - Add the results:\n     - \\(6120000 + 204000 + 4080 = 6328080\\)\n\n5. **Final Result**: The result of the multiplication \\(3 \\times 680 \\times 3102\\) is 6,328,080.\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(3 \\times 680 \\times 3102\\) is 6,328,080."
