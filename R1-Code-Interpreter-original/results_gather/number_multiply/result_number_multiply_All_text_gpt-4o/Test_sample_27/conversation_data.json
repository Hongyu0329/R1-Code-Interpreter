  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(2 \\times 232 \\times -7990\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 2, 232, and -7990. The operations involved are multiplication.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can perform the operations in any order. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: \n   - Multiply the first two numbers: \\(2 \\times 232\\).\n   - Calculation: \n     \\[\n     2 \\times 232 = 464\n     \\]\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**:\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number: \\(464 \\times -7990\\).\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     464 \\times -7990 = -3703360\n     \\]\n\n5. **Sign Consideration**: \n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative. Therefore, the final result will be negative.\n\n6. **Final Result**: The result of the expression \\(2 \\times 232 \\times -7990\\) is \\(-3703360\\).\n\n**Answer**: -3703360"
