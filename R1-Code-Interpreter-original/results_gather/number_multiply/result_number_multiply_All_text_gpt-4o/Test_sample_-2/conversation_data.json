    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-2 \\times -23 \\times -78 \\times -1578\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of negative numbers and the rules that govern them. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Negative Multiplication**:\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Multiplication**:\n   - Start by multiplying the first two numbers: \\(-2 \\times -23\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, their product is positive.\n     - \\(-2 \\times -23 = 46\\).\n\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(46 \\times -78\\).\n     - Here, one number is positive and the other is negative, so the product is negative.\n     - \\(46 \\times -78 = -3588\\).\n\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-3588 \\times -1578\\).\n     - Both numbers are negative, so their product is positive.\n     - \\(-3588 \\times -1578 = 5659464\\).\n\n3. **Final Result**:\n   - After performing the multiplications step by step, the final result of the expression \\(-2 \\times -23 \\times -78 \\times -1578\\) is \\(5659464\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-2 \\times -23 \\times -78 \\times -1578\\) is \\(5659464\\)."
