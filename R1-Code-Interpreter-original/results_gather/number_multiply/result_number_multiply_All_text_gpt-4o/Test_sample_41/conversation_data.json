    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the result of the expression \\(2 \\times -42 \\times 42 \\times 8133\\). Let's break down the calculation step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Expression**: The expression given is \\(2 \\times -42 \\times 42 \\times 8133\\).\n\n2. **Understand the Order of Operations**: The multiplication operation is associative, meaning we can perform the multiplications in any order. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **Calculate the First Multiplication**: \n   - Multiply \\(2\\) by \\(-42\\):\n     \\[\n     2 \\times -42 = -84\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Second Multiplication**:\n   - Multiply the result from the first step by \\(42\\):\n     \\[\n     -84 \\times 42 = -3528\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Third Multiplication**:\n   - Multiply the result from the second step by \\(8133\\):\n     \\[\n     -3528 \\times 8133\n     \\]\n\n6. **Perform the Final Multiplication**:\n   - To find \\(-3528 \\times 8133\\), we perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     -3528 \\times 8133 = -286978824\n     \\]\n\n7. **Sign of the Result**:\n   - Since we are multiplying an even number of negative numbers (two negative numbers), the final result will be negative.\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression \\(2 \\times -42 \\times 42 \\times 8133\\) is \\(-286978824\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(-286978824\\)"
