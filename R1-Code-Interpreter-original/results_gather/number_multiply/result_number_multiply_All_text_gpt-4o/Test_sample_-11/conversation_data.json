  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem \\(-3 \\times 71 \\times -18 \\times -3287\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of negative and positive numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-3\\), \\(71\\), \\(-18\\), and \\(-3287\\).\n   - There are three negative numbers and one positive number.\n\n2. **Understand the rules of multiplication with negative numbers:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - The product of an odd number of negative numbers is negative.\n   - The product of an even number of negative numbers is positive.\n\n3. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - We have three negative numbers (\\(-3\\), \\(-18\\), and \\(-3287\\)).\n   - Since there is an odd number of negative numbers, the overall product will be negative.\n\n4. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     \\[\n     |3| \\times |71| \\times |18| \\times |3287|\n     \\]\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(3 \\times 71 = 213\\)\n     - \\(213 \\times 18 = 3834\\)\n     - \\(3834 \\times 3287 = 12594458\\)\n\n5. **Apply the sign to the final product:**\n   - Since the overall sign is negative, the final result is \\(-12594458\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-3 \\times 71 \\times -18 \\times -3287\\) is \\(-12594458\\)."
