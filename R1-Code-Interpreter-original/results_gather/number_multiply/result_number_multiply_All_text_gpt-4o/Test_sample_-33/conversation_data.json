  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the result of the expression \\(2 \\times 232 \\times -7990\\). Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and operations**: \n   - The numbers involved are 2, 232, and -7990.\n   - The operations involved are multiplication.\n\n2. **Understand the properties of multiplication**:\n   - Multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which we perform the multiplication does not affect the result.\n   - Multiplying two positive numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(2 \\times 232\\).\n     - \\(2 \\times 232 = 464\\).\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(464 \\times -7990\\).\n     - Since 464 is positive and -7990 is negative, the result will be negative.\n     - Calculate the absolute value of the multiplication: \\(464 \\times 7990\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\(464 \\times 7990\\)**:\n   - Break down the multiplication for easier calculation:\n     - \\(464 \\times 7990 = 464 \\times (8000 - 10)\\).\n     - Use the distributive property: \\(464 \\times 8000 - 464 \\times 10\\).\n     - Calculate each part:\n       - \\(464 \\times 8000 = 3712000\\).\n       - \\(464 \\times 10 = 4640\\).\n     - Subtract the two results: \\(3712000 - 4640 = 3707360\\).\n\n5. **Apply the sign**:\n   - Since the multiplication involves a positive and a negative number, the final result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result of \\(464 \\times -7990\\) is \\(-3707360\\).\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\(-3707360\\)."
