  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(7 \\times 912 \\times -1782\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 7, 912, and -1782. The presence of a negative number (-1782) will affect the sign of the final result.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply the numbers in any order. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: \n   - Multiply the first two numbers: \\(7 \\times 912\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(7 \\times 912 = 6384\\).\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**:\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number: \\(6384 \\times -1782\\).\n   - Since one of the numbers is negative, the result will be negative.\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Result**:\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(6384 \\times -1782\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(6384 \\times 1782 = 11370768\\).\n   - Since we are multiplying by a negative number, the final result is \\(-11370768\\).\n\n6. **Sign of the Result**: \n   - The multiplication of a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we have carefully considered each part of the multiplication process.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(-11370768\\)"
