    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(6 \\times -56 \\times 20 \\times 1761\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and carefully analyze each part of the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   - The expression is a multiplication of four numbers: \\(6\\), \\(-56\\), \\(20\\), and \\(1761\\).\n   - The presence of a negative number (\\(-56\\)) will affect the sign of the final result.\n\n2. **Calculate the Product of the First Two Numbers:**\n   - Multiply \\(6\\) by \\(-56\\):\n     \\[\n     6 \\times -56 = -336\n     \\]\n   - The result is \\(-336\\) because multiplying a positive number by a negative number yields a negative result.\n\n3. **Multiply the Result by the Third Number:**\n   - Multiply \\(-336\\) by \\(20\\):\n     \\[\n     -336 \\times 20 = -6720\n     \\]\n   - The result is \\(-6720\\) because multiplying a negative number by a positive number yields a negative result.\n\n4. **Multiply the Result by the Fourth Number:**\n   - Multiply \\(-6720\\) by \\(1761\\):\n     \\[\n     -6720 \\times 1761 = -11819520\n     \\]\n   - The result is \\(-11819520\\) because multiplying a negative number by a positive number yields a negative result.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\(6 \\times -56 \\times 20 \\times 1761\\) is \\(-11819520\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe careful step-by-step multiplication and attention to the signs of the numbers lead us to the final answer.\n\n**Answer: -11819520**"
