    "To solve the problem \\(-4 \\times -464 \\times 7912\\), we need to follow the order of operations and carefully consider the multiplication of negative and positive numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-4\\), \\(-464\\), and \\(7912\\).\n   - \\(-4\\) and \\(-464\\) are negative numbers.\n   - \\(7912\\) is a positive number.\n\n2. **Understand the multiplication of negative numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - First, multiply the two negative numbers: \\(-4 \\times -464\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, the result will be positive.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(4 \\times 464 = 1856\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(-4 \\times -464 = 1856\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the result by the remaining positive number:**\n   - Now, multiply the result \\(1856\\) by \\(7912\\).\n   - Both numbers are positive, so the result will be positive.\n   - Calculate: \\(1856 \\times 7912\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the final result:**\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(1856 \\times 7912 = 14687872\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-4 \\times -464 \\times 7912\\) is \\(14687872\\).\n\n**Final Answer: 14687872**"
