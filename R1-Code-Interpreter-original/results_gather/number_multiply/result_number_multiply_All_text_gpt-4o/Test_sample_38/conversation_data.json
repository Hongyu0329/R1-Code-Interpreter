    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 848 \\times -4287\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply three numbers: 8, 848, and -4287.\n   - The multiplication involves a negative number, which will affect the sign of the result.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:**\n   - Multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which we perform the multiplication does not affect the final result.\n   - We can choose to multiply any two numbers first and then multiply the result by the third number.\n\n3. **Calculate the Intermediate Product:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(8 \\times 848\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 848 = 6784\n     \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the Intermediate Product by the Third Number:**\n   - Now, multiply the result from the previous step by the third number, which is -4287:\n     \\[\n     6784 \\times -4287\n     \\]\n   - Since one of the numbers is negative, the result will be negative.\n\n5. **Perform the Final Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate the product:\n     \\[\n     6784 \\times 4287 = 29081208\n     \\]\n   - Since we are multiplying by a negative number, the final result will be negative:\n     \\[\n     6784 \\times -4287 = -29081208\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 848 \\times -4287\\) is \\(-29081208\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n-29081208"
