  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(4 \\times 120 \\times -4430\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 4, 120, and -4430. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: In multiplication, the order in which we multiply numbers does not affect the result due to the commutative property of multiplication. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **Multiply the First Two Numbers**: \n   - First, multiply 4 by 120.\n   - \\(4 \\times 120 = 480\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the Result by the Third Number**:\n   - Now, take the result from the previous step (480) and multiply it by -4430.\n   - \\(480 \\times -4430\\).\n\n5. **Consider the Sign**:\n   - When multiplying a positive number by a negative number, the result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result of \\(480 \\times -4430\\) will be negative.\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(480 \\times 4430\\) without considering the sign first.\n   - Break it down if necessary:\n     - \\(480 \\times 4430 = 480 \\times (4000 + 430)\\).\n     - \\(480 \\times 4000 = 1,920,000\\).\n     - \\(480 \\times 430 = 206,400\\).\n     - Add these two results: \\(1,920,000 + 206,400 = 2,126,400\\).\n\n7. **Apply the Sign**:\n   - Since we are multiplying by a negative number, the final result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result is \\(-2,126,400\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(-2,126,400\\)."
