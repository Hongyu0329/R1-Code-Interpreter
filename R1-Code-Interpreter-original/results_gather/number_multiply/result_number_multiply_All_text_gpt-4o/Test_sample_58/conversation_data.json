    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-2 \\times -23 \\times -78 \\times -1578\\), we need to carefully consider the properties of multiplication, especially when dealing with negative numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Negative Multiplication**: \n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Counting the Negative Signs**:\n   - We have four negative numbers: \\(-2\\), \\(-23\\), \\(-78\\), and \\(-1578\\).\n   - An even number of negative signs (in this case, four) will result in a positive product.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-2 \\times -23\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, the result is positive: \\(2 \\times 23 = 46\\).\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(46 \\times -78\\).\n     - Here, we have a positive number and a negative number, so the result is negative: \\(-46 \\times 78\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-46 \\times 78 \\times -1578\\).\n     - Now, we have two negative numbers again, so the result is positive.\n\n4. **Calculating the Final Product**:\n   - Calculate \\(46 \\times 78\\):\n     - \\(46 \\times 78 = 3588\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3588 \\times 1578\\):\n     - This is a straightforward multiplication of two positive numbers.\n     - The result is \\(5669064\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression \\(-2 \\times -23 \\times -78 \\times -1578\\) is \\(5669064\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: 5669064"
