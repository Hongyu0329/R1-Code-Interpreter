    "To solve the problem \\(-6 \\times -36 \\times 37 \\times -9305\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of these numbers, especially focusing on the signs and the order of operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-6\\), \\(-36\\), \\(37\\), and \\(-9305\\).\n   - There are three negative numbers and one positive number.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative product.\n   - Since there are three negative numbers, the overall product will be negative (because an odd number of negative factors results in a negative product).\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, multiply the absolute values of the numbers:\n     - \\(|-6| = 6\\)\n     - \\(|-36| = 36\\)\n     - \\(|37| = 37\\)\n     - \\(|-9305| = 9305\\)\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - Multiply the first two numbers: \\(6 \\times 36 = 216\\).\n   - Multiply the result by the third number: \\(216 \\times 37\\).\n     - Break it down: \n       - \\(216 \\times 30 = 6480\\)\n       - \\(216 \\times 7 = 1512\\)\n     - Add the two results: \\(6480 + 1512 = 7992\\).\n   - Multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(7992 \\times 9305\\).\n     - This is a large multiplication, so break it down:\n       - \\(7992 \\times 9000 = 71928000\\)\n       - \\(7992 \\times 305 = 2442960\\)\n     - Add the two results: \\(71928000 + 2442960 = 74370960\\).\n\n5. **Apply the sign to the final result:**\n   - Since the overall product is negative, the final result is \\(-74370960\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-6 \\times -36 \\times 37 \\times -9305\\) is \\(-74370960\\)."
