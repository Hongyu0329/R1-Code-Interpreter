    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(3 \\times 73 \\times -4315\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 3, 73, and -4315. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply the numbers in any order. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 73 = 219\n   \\]\n   This result is positive because both numbers are positive.\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number:\n   \\[\n   219 \\times -4315\n   \\]\n   Here, we are multiplying a positive number (219) by a negative number (-4315), which will result in a negative product.\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Product**: Perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   219 \\times 4315 = 944085\n   \\]\n   Since we are multiplying by a negative number, the final result will be negative:\n   \\[\n   219 \\times -4315 = -944085\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The result of multiplying 3, 73, and -4315 is -944085.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n-944085"
