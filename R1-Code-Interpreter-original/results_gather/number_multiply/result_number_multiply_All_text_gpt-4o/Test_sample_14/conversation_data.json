    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(5 \\times -26 \\times -7684\\), we need to follow the order of operations and carefully consider the signs involved in the multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers and Signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 5, -26, and -7684.\n   - The signs are important: 5 is positive, -26 is negative, and -7684 is negative.\n\n2. **Understand the Multiplication of Signs:**\n   - Multiplying two numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative) results in a positive product.\n   - Multiplying two numbers with different signs (one positive and one negative) results in a negative product.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(5 \\times -26\\).\n     - Since 5 is positive and -26 is negative, the result will be negative.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(5 \\times 26 = 130\\).\n     - Apply the sign: \\(5 \\times -26 = -130\\).\n\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-130 \\times -7684\\).\n     - Both -130 and -7684 are negative, so the result will be positive.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(130 \\times 7684\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Product:**\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(130 \\times 7684\\).\n   - Break it down if necessary:\n     - \\(130 \\times 7684 = 130 \\times (7000 + 684)\\).\n     - \\(130 \\times 7000 = 910,000\\).\n     - \\(130 \\times 684 = 88,920\\).\n     - Add the two results: \\(910,000 + 88,920 = 998,920\\).\n\n5. **Apply the Sign:**\n   - Since the multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number, the final result is positive.\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression \\(5 \\times -26 \\times -7684\\) is 998,920.\n\n**Final Answer: 998,920**"
