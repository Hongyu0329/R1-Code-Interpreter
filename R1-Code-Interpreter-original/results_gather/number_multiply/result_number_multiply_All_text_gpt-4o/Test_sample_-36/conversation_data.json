  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(7 \\times 912 \\times -1782\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 7, 912, and -1782. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which we perform the multiplication does not affect the result. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **Multiply the First Two Numbers**: \n   - Calculate \\(7 \\times 912\\).\n   - \\(7 \\times 912 = 6384\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the Result by the Third Number**:\n   - Now, multiply the result from the previous step by -1782.\n   - Calculate \\(6384 \\times -1782\\).\n\n5. **Consider the Sign**:\n   - Since we are multiplying a positive number (6384) by a negative number (-1782), the result will be negative.\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(6384 \\times 1782\\) first, ignoring the sign.\n   - Use long multiplication or a calculator to find the product:\n     - \\(6384 \\times 1782 = 1136688\\).\n\n7. **Apply the Sign**:\n   - Since the multiplication involves a positive and a negative number, the final result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result is \\(-1136688\\).\n\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - The result of \\(7 \\times 912 \\times -1782\\) is \\(-1136688\\).\n\n**Answer**: -1136688"
