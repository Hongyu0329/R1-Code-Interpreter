    "To solve the expression \\(8 \\times -42 \\times 72 \\times -4704\\), we need to carefully analyze and compute the product step by step, taking into account the properties of multiplication, especially the signs of the numbers involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Signs:**\n   - The expression involves four numbers: 8, -42, 72, and -4704.\n   - The signs of these numbers are: positive, negative, positive, and negative, respectively.\n\n2. **Determine the Overall Sign:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive and a negative number is negative.\n   - Therefore, the product of four numbers with two negative signs will be positive, because:\n     - Negative \\(\\times\\) Negative = Positive\n     - Positive \\(\\times\\) Positive = Positive\n\n3. **Calculate the Absolute Values:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     - \\(8 \\times 42 = 336\\)\n     - \\(336 \\times 72 = 24,192\\)\n     - \\(24,192 \\times 4704 = 113,799,168\\)\n\n4. **Apply the Overall Sign:**\n   - Since we determined that the overall sign of the product is positive, the final result is positive.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of the expression \\(8 \\times -42 \\times 72 \\times -4704\\) is \\(113,799,168\\).\n\n**Answer:** 113,799,168"
