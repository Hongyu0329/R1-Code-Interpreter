    "To solve the problem \\(-6 \\times 44 \\times -9255\\), we need to follow the order of operations and carefully consider the signs of the numbers involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-6\\), \\(44\\), and \\(-9255\\).\n   - The signs are negative for \\(-6\\) and \\(-9255\\), and positive for \\(44\\).\n\n2. **Understand the multiplication of negative numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-6 \\times 44\\).\n     - \\(-6 \\times 44 = -264\\) because a negative times a positive is negative.\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-264 \\times -9255\\).\n     - \\(-264 \\times -9255 = 244,3320\\) because a negative times a negative is positive.\n\n4. **Final result:**\n   - The result of the multiplication \\(-6 \\times 44 \\times -9255\\) is \\(2,443,320\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(2,443,320\\)."
