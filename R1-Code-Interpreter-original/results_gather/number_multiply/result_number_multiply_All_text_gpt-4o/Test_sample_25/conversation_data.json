  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\(7 \\times -442 \\times 2319\\). Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 7, -442, and 2319. The operations involved are multiplication.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can perform the operations in any order. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: \n   - Multiply 7 by -442.\n   - \\(7 \\times -442 = -3094\\).\n   - The result is negative because a positive number multiplied by a negative number yields a negative result.\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**:\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication (-3094) by 2319.\n   - \\(-3094 \\times 2319\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Result**:\n   - Perform the multiplication: \n     - \\(-3094 \\times 2319 = -7186086\\).\n   - The result is negative because a negative number multiplied by a positive number yields a negative result.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: The result of the expression \\(7 \\times -442 \\times 2319\\) is \\(-7186086\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(-7186086\\)."
