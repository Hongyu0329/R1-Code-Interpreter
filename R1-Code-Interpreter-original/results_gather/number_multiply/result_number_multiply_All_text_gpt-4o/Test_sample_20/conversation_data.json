  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-4 \\times -583 \\times -7904\\), we need to carefully analyze and perform the multiplication step by step, keeping in mind the rules of multiplication involving negative numbers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have three numbers: \\(-4\\), \\(-583\\), and \\(-7904\\).\n   - We need to multiply these numbers together.\n\n2. **Rules of Multiplication with Negative Numbers:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - **First Multiplication: \\(-4 \\times -583\\)**\n     - Both numbers are negative, so their product will be positive.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(4 \\times 583\\).\n     - \\(4 \\times 583 = 2332\\).\n     - Since both numbers were negative, the result is positive: \\(2332\\).\n\n   - **Second Multiplication: \\(2332 \\times -7904\\)**\n     - Now, we have a positive number (\\(2332\\)) and a negative number (\\(-7904\\)).\n     - The product of a positive and a negative number is negative.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(2332 \\times 7904\\).\n     - Perform the multiplication:\n       - \\(2332 \\times 7904 = 18433728\\).\n     - Since one number is positive and the other is negative, the result is negative: \\(-18433728\\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of \\(-4 \\times -583 \\times -7904\\) is \\(-18433728\\).\n\n**Answer: -18433728**"
