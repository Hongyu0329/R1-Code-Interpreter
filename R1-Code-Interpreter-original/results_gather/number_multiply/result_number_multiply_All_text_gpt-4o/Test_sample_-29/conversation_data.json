    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(8 \\times 881 \\times -7297\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 8, 881, and -7297. We need to multiply these numbers together.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply the numbers in any order. However, for simplicity, we will multiply them from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 881\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(8 \\times 881\\):\n     - \\(8 \\times 881 = 7048\\)\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number:\n   \\[\n   7048 \\times -7297\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(7048 \\times -7297\\):\n     - Since one of the numbers is negative, the result will be negative.\n     - Perform the multiplication:\n       - \\(7048 \\times 7297 = 51473956\\)\n     - Therefore, \\(7048 \\times -7297 = -51473956\\)\n\n5. **Final Result**: The result of the expression \\(8 \\times 881 \\times -7297\\) is \\(-51473956\\).\n\n**Answer**: -51473956"
