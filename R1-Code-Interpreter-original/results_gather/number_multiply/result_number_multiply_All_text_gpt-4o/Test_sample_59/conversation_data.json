    "To find the result of the multiplication \\(3 \\times 86 \\times 24 \\times 1020\\), we can break down the calculation into smaller, more manageable steps. This approach helps to minimize errors and makes it easier to follow the process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Multiply the first two numbers:**\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 86\\).\n   - \\(3 \\times 86 = 258\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the result by the next number:**\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first step by 24.\n   - \\(258 \\times 24\\).\n\n   To simplify, break it down further:\n   - \\(258 \\times 24 = 258 \\times (20 + 4)\\).\n   - \\(258 \\times 20 = 5160\\).\n   - \\(258 \\times 4 = 1032\\).\n   - Add these two results: \\(5160 + 1032 = 6192\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the result by the last number:**\n   - Now, multiply the result from the second step by 1020.\n   - \\(6192 \\times 1020\\).\n\n   Again, break it down:\n   - \\(6192 \\times 1020 = 6192 \\times (1000 + 20)\\).\n   - \\(6192 \\times 1000 = 6192000\\).\n   - \\(6192 \\times 20 = 123840\\).\n   - Add these two results: \\(6192000 + 123840 = 6315840\\).\n\n### Final Result:\nThe result of the multiplication \\(3 \\times 86 \\times 24 \\times 1020\\) is \\(6315840\\).\n\n**Answer:** 6315840"
