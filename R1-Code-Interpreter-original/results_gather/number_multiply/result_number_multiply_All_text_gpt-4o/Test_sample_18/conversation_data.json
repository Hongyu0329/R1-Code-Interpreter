    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-3 \\times -56 \\times -2644\\), we need to carefully analyze the multiplication of these three negative numbers step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Sign Rule for Multiplication:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-3\\) and \\(-56\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, their product will be positive.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(3 \\times 56 = 168\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(-3 \\times -56 = 168\\).\n\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(168 \\times -2644\\).\n     - Here, 168 is positive and \\(-2644\\) is negative, so the product will be negative.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(168 \\times 2644\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Final Product:**\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(168 \\times 2644\\).\n     - Break it down if necessary for easier calculation:\n       - \\(168 \\times 2644 = 168 \\times (2600 + 44)\\).\n       - \\(168 \\times 2600 = 168 \\times 26 \\times 100 = 4368 \\times 100 = 436800\\).\n       - \\(168 \\times 44 = 7392\\).\n     - Add these two results: \\(436800 + 7392 = 444192\\).\n\n4. **Apply the Sign:**\n   - Since the multiplication of a positive and a negative number is negative, the final result is \\(-444192\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-3 \\times -56 \\times -2644\\) is \\(-444192\\)."
