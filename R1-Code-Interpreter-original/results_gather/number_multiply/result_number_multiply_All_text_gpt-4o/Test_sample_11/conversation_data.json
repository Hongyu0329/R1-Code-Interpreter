    "To find the result of the multiplication \\(5 \\times 90 \\times 1587\\), we can break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply three numbers: 5, 90, and 1587.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply these numbers in any order. However, it might be easier to multiply the smaller numbers first.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 90 = 450\n   \\]\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number:\n   \\[\n   450 \\times 1587\n   \\]\n\n5. **Break Down the Second Multiplication**: To simplify \\(450 \\times 1587\\), we can use the distributive property:\n   \\[\n   450 \\times 1587 = (400 + 50) \\times 1587\n   \\]\n\n6. **Distribute the Multiplication**:\n   - Multiply 400 by 1587:\n     \\[\n     400 \\times 1587 = 634800\n     \\]\n   - Multiply 50 by 1587:\n     \\[\n     50 \\times 1587 = 79350\n     \\]\n\n7. **Add the Results**: Add the two products from the distribution:\n   \\[\n   634800 + 79350 = 714150\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final Result**: The result of \\(5 \\times 90 \\times 1587\\) is 714150.\n\nTherefore, the result of the multiplication \\(5 \\times 90 \\times 1587\\) is 714150."
