    "To solve the expression \\(7 \\times -31 \\times 70 \\times -9705\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of these numbers, especially the signs involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - 7 is positive.\n   - -31 is negative.\n   - 70 is positive.\n   - -9705 is negative.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - Multiplying two numbers with different signs results in a negative product.\n   - Multiplying two numbers with the same sign results in a positive product.\n   - In this expression, we have two negative numbers (-31 and -9705) and two positive numbers (7 and 70).\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product, so \\(-31 \\times -9705\\) will be positive.\n   - Multiplying two positive numbers results in a positive product, so \\(7 \\times 70\\) will be positive.\n   - Finally, multiplying the two positive results will yield a positive product.\n\n3. **Calculate the product step by step:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the positive numbers: \n     \\[\n     7 \\times 70 = 490\n     \\]\n   - Next, calculate the product of the negative numbers:\n     \\[\n     -31 \\times -9705 = 31 \\times 9705\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(31 \\times 9705\\):\n     - Break it down further if needed:\n       \\[\n       31 \\times 9705 = 31 \\times (9000 + 700 + 5)\n       \\]\n     - Calculate each part:\n       \\[\n       31 \\times 9000 = 279000\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       31 \\times 700 = 21700\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       31 \\times 5 = 155\n       \\]\n     - Add these results together:\n       \\[\n       279000 + 21700 + 155 = 300855\n       \\]\n   - Now, multiply the results of the two positive products:\n     \\[\n     490 \\times 300855\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the final product:**\n   - Break down \\(490 \\times 300855\\) if needed:\n     \\[\n     490 \\times 300855 = 490 \\times (300000 + 855)\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each part:\n     \\[\n     490 \\times 300000 = 147000000\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     490 \\times 855 = 419950\n     \\]\n   - Add these results together:\n     \\[\n     147000000 + 419950 = 147419950\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression \\(7 \\times -31 \\times 70 \\times -9705\\) is \\(147419950\\).\n\n**Answer: 147419950**"
