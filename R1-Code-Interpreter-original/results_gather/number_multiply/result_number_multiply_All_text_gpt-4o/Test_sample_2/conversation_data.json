    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(8 \\times -76 \\times -6996\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 8, -76, and -6996. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: In multiplication, the order in which we multiply numbers does not affect the result due to the commutative property of multiplication. However, we will proceed step by step for clarity.\n\n3. **Multiply the First Two Numbers**: \n   - Multiply 8 by -76.\n   - \\(8 \\times -76 = -608\\).\n   - The result is negative because a positive number multiplied by a negative number yields a negative result.\n\n4. **Multiply the Result by the Third Number**:\n   - Now, multiply the result from the previous step (-608) by -6996.\n   - \\(-608 \\times -6996\\).\n   - When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive.\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Result**:\n   - Calculate \\(-608 \\times -6996\\).\n   - First, calculate the absolute values: \\(608 \\times 6996\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \n     - \\(608 \\times 6996 = 4253568\\).\n   - Since both numbers were negative, the result is positive.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The final result of multiplying 8, -76, and -6996 is 4253568.\n\n**Answer**: 4253568"
