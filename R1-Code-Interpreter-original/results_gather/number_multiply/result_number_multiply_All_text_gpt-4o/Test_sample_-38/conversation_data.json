    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\(3 \\times (-190) \\times (-8028)\\). Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 3, -190, and -8028. We need to multiply these numbers together.\n\n2. **Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: When multiplying numbers, the sign of the result depends on the signs of the numbers being multiplied:\n   - A positive number times a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - A negative number times a negative number results in a positive number.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(3 \\times (-190)\\).\n     - \\(3 \\times (-190) = -570\\).\n     - The result is negative because a positive number is multiplied by a negative number.\n\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-570 \\times (-8028)\\).\n     - \\(-570 \\times (-8028) = 4575960\\).\n     - The result is positive because a negative number is multiplied by another negative number.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The final result of the expression \\(3 \\times (-190) \\times (-8028)\\) is 4575960.\n\n**Answer**: 4575960"
