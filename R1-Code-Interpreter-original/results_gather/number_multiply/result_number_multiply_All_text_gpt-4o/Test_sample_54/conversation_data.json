    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(6 \\times 78 \\times -24 \\times -5459\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach, taking into account the properties of multiplication, especially with negative numbers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers and Signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 6, 78, -24, and -5459.\n   - There are two negative numbers: -24 and -5459.\n\n2. **Understand the Effect of Negative Signs:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Calculate the Product of the First Two Numbers:**\n   - Multiply 6 and 78:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 78 = 468\n     \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the Result by the Third Number (-24):**\n   - Multiply 468 by -24:\n     \\[\n     468 \\times -24 = -11232\n     \\]\n   - The result is negative because we are multiplying a positive number (468) by a negative number (-24).\n\n5. **Multiply the Result by the Fourth Number (-5459):**\n   - Multiply -11232 by -5459:\n     \\[\n     -11232 \\times -5459 = 61269168\n     \\]\n   - The result is positive because we are multiplying two negative numbers, which results in a positive product.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of the expression \\(6 \\times 78 \\times -24 \\times -5459\\) is \\(61269168\\)."
