    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(9 \\times (-177) \\times (-8301)\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 9, -177, and -8301. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which we perform the multiplication does not affect the result. However, for clarity, we will proceed step by step.\n\n3. **Multiply the First Two Numbers**: \n   - Calculate \\(9 \\times (-177)\\).\n   - Since one number is positive and the other is negative, the result will be negative.\n   - \\(9 \\times 177 = 1593\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(9 \\times (-177) = -1593\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the Result with the Third Number**:\n   - Now, multiply the result \\(-1593\\) by \\(-8301\\).\n   - Both numbers are negative, so the result will be positive.\n   - Calculate \\(1593 \\times 8301\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Break down the multiplication for clarity:\n     - \\(1593 \\times 8301\\) can be calculated using the distributive property:\n     - \\(1593 \\times (8000 + 301)\\).\n     - Calculate \\(1593 \\times 8000\\) and \\(1593 \\times 301\\) separately, then add the results.\n     - \\(1593 \\times 8000 = 12744000\\).\n     - \\(1593 \\times 301 = 479193\\).\n     - Add the two results: \\(12744000 + 479193 = 13223193\\).\n\n6. **Final Result**:\n   - Since the multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number, the final result is positive.\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(9 \\times (-177) \\times (-8301)\\) is \\(13223193\\).\n\n**Answer**: 13223193"
