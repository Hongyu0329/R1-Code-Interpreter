    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-4 \\times -583 \\times -7904\\), we need to carefully analyze the multiplication of these three negative numbers step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Sign Rule for Multiplication:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-4\\) and \\(-583\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, their product will be positive.\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(4 \\times 583\\).\n     - \\(4 \\times 583 = 2332\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(-4 \\times -583 = 2332\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the Result with the Third Number:**\n   - Now, multiply the result \\(2332\\) by the third number \\(-7904\\).\n   - Since \\(2332\\) is positive and \\(-7904\\) is negative, the product will be negative.\n   - Calculate the absolute values: \\(2332 \\times 7904\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \n     - \\(2332 \\times 7904 = 18435328\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(2332 \\times -7904 = -18435328\\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of \\(-4 \\times -583 \\times -7904\\) is \\(-18435328\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(-18435328\\)"
