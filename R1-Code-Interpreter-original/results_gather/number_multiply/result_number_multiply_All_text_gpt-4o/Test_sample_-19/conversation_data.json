    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze and perform the multiplication step by step. The expression given is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times (-42) \\times 42 \\times 8133 \\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Multiply 2 and -42:**\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (-42) = -84\n   \\]\n   The result is -84 because multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 42:**\n   \\[\n   -84 \\times 42\n   \\]\n   To perform this multiplication, we can break it down further:\n   - First, calculate \\( 84 \\times 42 \\).\n   - \\( 84 \\times 42 = 3528 \\) (ignoring the sign for now).\n   - Since the original number was negative, the result is \\(-3528\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the result by 8133:**\n   \\[\n   -3528 \\times 8133\n   \\]\n   Again, we can break this down:\n   - First, calculate \\( 3528 \\times 8133 \\).\n   - This is a straightforward multiplication, but it involves large numbers. The result is \\( 28,671,924 \\).\n   - Since the original number was negative, the result is \\(-28,671,924\\).\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression \\( 2 \\times (-42) \\times 42 \\times 8133 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-28,671,924}\n\\]"
