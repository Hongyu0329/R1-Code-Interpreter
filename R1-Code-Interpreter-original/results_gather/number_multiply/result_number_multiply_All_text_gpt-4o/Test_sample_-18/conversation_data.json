    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\), we need to carefully analyze and compute the expression step by step, taking into account the rules of arithmetic operations, especially the handling of negative numbers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Expression:**\n   The expression given is \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\).\n\n2. **Understand the Order of Operations:**\n   - Multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which we perform the multiplication does not affect the result.\n   - We can multiply the numbers in any order, but it is often easier to multiply two numbers at a time.\n\n3. **Handling Negative Numbers:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(5 \\times -69\\).\n     \\[\n     5 \\times -69 = -345\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-345 \\times 90\\).\n     \\[\n     -345 \\times 90 = -31050\n     \\]\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-31050 \\times -9786\\).\n     \\[\n     -31050 \\times -9786 = 303843300\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\) is \\(303843300\\).\n\n**Answer:** 303843300"
