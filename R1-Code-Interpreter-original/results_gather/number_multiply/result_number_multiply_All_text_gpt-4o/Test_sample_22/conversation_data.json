    "To solve the problem 3 * -190 * -8028, we need to follow the order of operations and carefully handle the multiplication of negative numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 3, -190, and -8028.\n   - The signs are positive for 3, negative for -190, and negative for -8028.\n\n2. **Understand the multiplication of negative numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: 3 and -190.\n     - 3 * -190 = -570\n     - Here, a positive number (3) is multiplied by a negative number (-190), resulting in a negative product (-570).\n\n   - Next, multiply the result (-570) by the third number (-8028).\n     - -570 * -8028\n     - Here, a negative number (-570) is multiplied by another negative number (-8028), resulting in a positive product.\n\n4. **Calculate the final multiplication:**\n   - To find the product of -570 and -8028, we first calculate the absolute values:\n     - 570 * 8028\n     - Perform the multiplication: 570 * 8028 = 4,575,960\n\n5. **Determine the sign of the final result:**\n   - Since we multiplied two negative numbers, the result is positive.\n\nTherefore, the result of 3 * -190 * -8028 is 4,575,960.\n\n**Final Answer: 4,575,960**"
