    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(6 \\times -56 \\times 20 \\times 1761\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: \n   - The expression involves multiplication of four numbers: 6, -56, 20, and 1761.\n   - Note that one of the numbers is negative (-56), which will affect the sign of the final result.\n\n2. **Determine the Sign of the Result**:\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a positive number results in a positive number.\n   - In this expression, we have one negative number (-56) and three positive numbers (6, 20, 1761).\n   - Therefore, the result of the entire expression will be negative.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication Step by Step**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(6 \\times -56\\).\n     \\[\n     6 \\times -56 = -336\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-336 \\times 20\\).\n     \\[\n     -336 \\times 20 = -6720\n     \\]\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-6720 \\times 1761\\).\n     \\[\n     -6720 \\times 1761 = -11819520\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Result**:\n   - The final result of the expression \\(6 \\times -56 \\times 20 \\times 1761\\) is \\(-11819520\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression is \\(-11819520\\)."
