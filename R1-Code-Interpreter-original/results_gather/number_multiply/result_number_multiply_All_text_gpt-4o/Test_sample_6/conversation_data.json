    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(4 \\times 60 \\times 5250\\), we will break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply three numbers: 4, 60, and 5250.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can perform the multiplication in stages to simplify the process. We will first multiply two of the numbers and then multiply the result by the third number.\n\n3. **First Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply 4 by 60.\n   - \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\).\n\n4. **Second Multiplication:**\n   - Now, take the result from the first multiplication (240) and multiply it by 5250.\n   - \\(240 \\times 5250\\).\n\n5. **Break Down the Second Multiplication:**\n   - To simplify \\(240 \\times 5250\\), we can use the distributive property of multiplication:\n   - \\(240 \\times 5250 = 240 \\times (5000 + 250)\\).\n   - This can be broken down into two separate multiplications:\n     - \\(240 \\times 5000\\).\n     - \\(240 \\times 250\\).\n\n6. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **\\(240 \\times 5000\\):**\n     - \\(240 \\times 5000 = 240 \\times 5 \\times 1000\\).\n     - \\(240 \\times 5 = 1200\\).\n     - \\(1200 \\times 1000 = 1,200,000\\).\n\n   - **\\(240 \\times 250\\):**\n     - \\(240 \\times 250 = 240 \\times (200 + 50)\\).\n     - \\(240 \\times 200 = 48,000\\).\n     - \\(240 \\times 50 = 12,000\\).\n     - Add these results: \\(48,000 + 12,000 = 60,000\\).\n\n7. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Now, add the results of the two parts:\n   - \\(1,200,000 + 60,000 = 1,260,000\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of \\(4 \\times 60 \\times 5250\\) is 1,260,000."
