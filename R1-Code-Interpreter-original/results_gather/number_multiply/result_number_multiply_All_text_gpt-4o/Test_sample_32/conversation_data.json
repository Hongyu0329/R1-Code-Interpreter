    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(8 \\times 939 \\times -8489\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 8, 939, and -8489. The operation involves multiplication of these three numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can perform the operations in any order. However, for simplicity, we will multiply the first two numbers and then multiply the result by the third number.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: \n   - Multiply 8 by 939.\n   - \\(8 \\times 939 = 7512\\).\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**:\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication (7512) by -8489.\n   - \\(7512 \\times -8489\\).\n\n5. **Sign Consideration**:\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result will be negative.\n\n6. **Calculate the Final Product**:\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(7512 \\times 8489\\).\n   - This results in 637,444,968.\n\n7. **Apply the Sign**:\n   - Since the multiplication involves a negative number, the final result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result is \\(-637,444,968\\).\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\(-637,444,968\\)."
