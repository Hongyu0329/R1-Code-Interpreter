    "To solve the expression \\(8 \\times -42 \\times 72 \\times -4704\\), we need to carefully analyze and compute the result step by step, taking into account the rules of multiplication, especially with negative numbers.\n\n1. **Identify the signs**: \n   - The expression involves four numbers: 8, -42, 72, and -4704.\n   - The signs of these numbers are positive, negative, positive, and negative, respectively.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product**:\n   - Multiplying two numbers with different signs results in a negative product.\n   - Multiplying two numbers with the same sign results in a positive product.\n   - In this expression, we have two negative numbers (-42 and -4704) and two positive numbers (8 and 72).\n   - Multiplying the two negative numbers will result in a positive product.\n   - Therefore, the overall product of all four numbers will be positive because the product of two positive numbers (8 and 72) and the positive result from the two negative numbers will be positive.\n\n3. **Calculate the product step by step**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(8 \\times -42\\).\n     \\[\n     8 \\times -42 = -336\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-336 \\times 72\\).\n     \\[\n     -336 \\times 72 = -24192\n     \\]\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-24192 \\times -4704\\).\n     \\[\n     -24192 \\times -4704 = 113246208\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final result of the expression \\(8 \\times -42 \\times 72 \\times -4704\\) is 113,246,208.\n\n**Answer**: 113246208"
