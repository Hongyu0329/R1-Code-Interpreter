    "To solve the problem \\(-8 \\times -99 \\times -19 \\times 4872\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of these numbers, especially focusing on the signs and the order of operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-8\\), \\(-99\\), \\(-19\\), and \\(4872\\).\n   - There are three negative numbers and one positive number.\n\n2. **Determine the sign of the final result:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying three negative numbers and one positive number will result in a negative number because:\n     - \\((-8) \\times (-99)\\) is positive.\n     - The result of the above, when multiplied by \\(-19\\), becomes negative.\n     - Finally, multiplying the negative result by \\(4872\\) (a positive number) keeps it negative.\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     - \\(|-8| = 8\\)\n     - \\(|-99| = 99\\)\n     - \\(|-19| = 19\\)\n     - \\(|4872| = 4872\\)\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 99 = 792\n     \\]\n   - Multiply the result by the next number:\n     \\[\n     792 \\times 19 = 15048\n     \\]\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the last number:\n     \\[\n     15048 \\times 4872 = 73369956\n     \\]\n\n5. **Apply the sign to the final result:**\n   - Since we determined earlier that the result should be negative, the final answer is:\n     \\[\n     -73369956\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-8 \\times -99 \\times -19 \\times 4872\\) is \\(-73369956\\)."
