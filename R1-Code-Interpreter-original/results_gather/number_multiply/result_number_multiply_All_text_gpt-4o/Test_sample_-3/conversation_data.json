    "To solve the problem \\(-7 \\times -43 \\times -81 \\times 8355\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of negative and positive numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-7\\), \\(-43\\), \\(-81\\), and \\(8355\\).\n   - There are three negative numbers and one positive number.\n\n2. **Understand the rules of multiplication for negative numbers:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n3. **Calculate the product step by step:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Multiply the first two numbers: \\(-7 \\times -43\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, their product is positive.\n     - \\(-7 \\times -43 = 301\\).\n\n   - **Step 2:** Multiply the result by the next number: \\(301 \\times -81\\).\n     - Here, we have a positive number and a negative number, so the product is negative.\n     - \\(301 \\times -81 = -24381\\).\n\n   - **Step 3:** Multiply the result by the last number: \\(-24381 \\times 8355\\).\n     - Again, we have a negative number and a positive number, so the product is negative.\n     - \\(-24381 \\times 8355 = -203646555\\).\n\n4. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication is \\(-203646555\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-7 \\times -43 \\times -81 \\times 8355\\) is \\(-203646555\\)."
