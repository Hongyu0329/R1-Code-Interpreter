    "To solve the problem \\(-3 \\times 71 \\times -18 \\times -3287\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of negative numbers and the order of operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-3\\), \\(71\\), \\(-18\\), and \\(-3287\\).\n   - There are three negative numbers: \\(-3\\), \\(-18\\), and \\(-3287\\).\n   - There is one positive number: \\(71\\).\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - Since there are three negative numbers, the overall product will be negative (because the product of an odd number of negative numbers is negative).\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 71 \\times 18 \\times 3287\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 71\\):\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 71 = 213\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(213 \\times 18\\):\n     \\[\n     213 \\times 18 = 3834\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(3834 \\times 3287\\):\n     \\[\n     3834 \\times 3287 = 12594438\n     \\]\n\n5. **Apply the sign to the final product:**\n   - Since we determined that the overall product is negative, the final result is:\n     \\[\n     -12594438\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-3 \\times 71 \\times -18 \\times -3287\\) is \\(-12594438\\).\n\n**Answer:** -12594438"
