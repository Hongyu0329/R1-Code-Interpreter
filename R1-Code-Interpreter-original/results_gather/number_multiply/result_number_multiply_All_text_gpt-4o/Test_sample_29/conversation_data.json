    "To solve the expression \\(7 \\times -705 \\times -6206\\), we need to follow the order of operations and carefully consider the signs of the numbers involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 7, -705, and -6206.\n   - The signs are positive for 7, negative for 705, and negative for 6206.\n\n2. **Understand the multiplication of negative numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n\n   **Step 1:** Multiply the first two numbers: \\(7 \\times -705\\).\n   - Since 7 is positive and -705 is negative, the result will be negative.\n   - Calculate the absolute value: \\(7 \\times 705 = 4935\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(7 \\times -705 = -4935\\).\n\n   **Step 2:** Multiply the result from Step 1 by the third number: \\(-4935 \\times -6206\\).\n   - Both numbers are negative, so the result will be positive.\n   - Calculate the absolute value: \\(4935 \\times 6206\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the final multiplication:**\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(4935 \\times 6206\\).\n   - This is a straightforward multiplication of two positive numbers.\n\n5. **Compute the final result:**\n   - \\(4935 \\times 6206 = 30683710\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression \\(7 \\times -705 \\times -6206\\) is 30683710.\n\n**Answer: 30683710**"
