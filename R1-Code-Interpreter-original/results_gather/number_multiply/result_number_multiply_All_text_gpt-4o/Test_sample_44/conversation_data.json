    "To solve the problem \\(-2 \\times 78 \\times -61 \\times -5850\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of negative and positive numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-2\\), \\(78\\), \\(-61\\), and \\(-5850\\).\n   - There are three negative numbers and one positive number.\n\n2. **Understand the rules of multiplication with negative numbers:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - The product of an odd number of negative numbers is negative.\n   - The product of an even number of negative numbers is positive.\n\n3. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - We have three negative numbers (\\(-2\\), \\(-61\\), and \\(-5850\\)).\n   - Since there is an odd number of negative numbers, the overall product will be negative.\n\n4. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 78 \\times 61 \\times 5850\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 78 = 156\\).\n   - Calculate \\(156 \\times 61\\):\n     - Break it down: \\(156 \\times 61 = 156 \\times (60 + 1) = 156 \\times 60 + 156 \\times 1\\).\n     - Calculate \\(156 \\times 60 = 9360\\).\n     - Calculate \\(156 \\times 1 = 156\\).\n     - Add the results: \\(9360 + 156 = 9516\\).\n   - Calculate \\(9516 \\times 5850\\):\n     - Break it down: \\(9516 \\times 5850 = 9516 \\times (5800 + 50)\\).\n     - Calculate \\(9516 \\times 5800\\):\n       - \\(9516 \\times 5800 = 9516 \\times (58 \\times 100)\\).\n       - Calculate \\(9516 \\times 58\\):\n         - Break it down: \\(9516 \\times 58 = 9516 \\times (50 + 8)\\).\n         - Calculate \\(9516 \\times 50 = 475800\\).\n         - Calculate \\(9516 \\times 8 = 76128\\).\n         - Add the results: \\(475800 + 76128 = 551928\\).\n       - Multiply by 100: \\(551928 \\times 100 = 55192800\\).\n     - Calculate \\(9516 \\times 50 = 475800\\).\n     - Add the results: \\(55192800 + 475800 = 55668600\\).\n\n6. **Apply the sign to the final product:**\n   - Since the overall sign is negative, the final result is \\(-55668600\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-2 \\times 78 \\times -61 \\times -5850\\) is \\(-55668600\\)."
