    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-4 \\times 72 \\times 9767\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem requires us to multiply three numbers: \\(-4\\), \\(72\\), and \\(9767\\). The multiplication of these numbers will give us the final result.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Sign\n- The first number is \\(-4\\), which is negative.\n- The other two numbers, \\(72\\) and \\(9767\\), are positive.\n- Multiplying a negative number by a positive number results in a negative number.\n- Therefore, the final result will be negative.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Multiplication\nWe will multiply the numbers in two steps to simplify the calculation:\n\n#### Step 3.1: Multiply the First Two Numbers\n- Multiply \\(-4\\) by \\(72\\):\n  \\[\n  -4 \\times 72 = -288\n  \\]\n  The result is \\(-288\\).\n\n#### Step 3.2: Multiply the Result by the Third Number\n- Now, multiply \\(-288\\) by \\(9767\\):\n  \\[\n  -288 \\times 9767\n  \\]\n  To perform this multiplication, we can break it down further if needed, but for simplicity, let's calculate directly:\n  \\[\n  -288 \\times 9767 = -2814336\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe final result of multiplying \\(-4\\), \\(72\\), and \\(9767\\) is \\(-2814336\\).\n\n**Answer: -2814336**"
