    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(8 \\times 14 \\times -63 \\times -2676\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach, considering the properties of multiplication and the signs of the numbers involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers and Their Signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 8, 14, -63, and -2676.\n   - The signs are positive for 8 and 14, and negative for -63 and -2676.\n\n2. **Understand the Effect of Multiplying Negative Numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Pair the Numbers for Easier Calculation:**\n   - We can pair the negative numbers together: \\(-63 \\times -2676\\).\n   - We can pair the positive numbers together: \\(8 \\times 14\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Product of Positive Numbers:**\n   - \\(8 \\times 14 = 112\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Product of Negative Numbers:**\n   - \\(-63 \\times -2676\\).\n   - Since both numbers are negative, their product will be positive.\n   - Calculate the absolute values: \\(63 \\times 2676\\).\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - First, calculate \\(63 \\times 2676\\):\n     - Break it down if necessary for easier calculation:\n     - \\(63 \\times 2676 = 63 \\times (2600 + 76)\\).\n     - \\(63 \\times 2600 = 163800\\).\n     - \\(63 \\times 76 = 4788\\).\n     - Add the results: \\(163800 + 4788 = 168588\\).\n\n7. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Now, multiply the results of the positive and negative products:\n   - \\(112 \\times 168588\\).\n\n8. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     - \\(112 \\times 168588 = 18881656\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe result of the expression \\(8 \\times 14 \\times -63 \\times -2676\\) is 18,881,656.\n\n**Answer:** 18,881,656"
