    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(3 \\times 245 \\times -5881\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply three numbers: 3, 245, and -5881. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply the numbers in any order. However, for simplicity, we will multiply them sequentially from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 245 = 735\n   \\]\n   This result is positive because both numbers are positive.\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number:\n   \\[\n   735 \\times -5881\n   \\]\n   Since one of the numbers is negative, the result will be negative.\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Result**: Perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   735 \\times 5881 = 4,321,935\n   \\]\n   Since we are multiplying by a negative number, the final result is:\n   \\[\n   -4,321,935\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The result of multiplying 3, 245, and -5881 is \\(-4,321,935\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(-4,321,935\\)"
