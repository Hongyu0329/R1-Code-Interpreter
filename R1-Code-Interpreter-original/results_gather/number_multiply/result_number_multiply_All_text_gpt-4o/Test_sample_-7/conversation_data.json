    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-5 \\times -79 \\times 57 \\times 8192\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have four numbers: \\(-5\\), \\(-79\\), \\(57\\), and \\(8192\\).\n   - We need to multiply these numbers together.\n\n2. **Handling Negative Signs:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - In this problem, we have two negative numbers (\\(-5\\) and \\(-79\\)), so their product will be positive.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the two negative numbers: \\(-5 \\times -79\\).\n     - \\(-5 \\times -79 = 395\\) (since the product of two negatives is positive).\n   - Next, multiply the result by \\(57\\):\n     - \\(395 \\times 57\\).\n     - Break it down further:\n       - \\(395 \\times 57 = 395 \\times (50 + 7)\\).\n       - \\(395 \\times 50 = 19750\\).\n       - \\(395 \\times 7 = 2765\\).\n       - Add these two results: \\(19750 + 2765 = 22515\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the result by \\(8192\\):\n     - \\(22515 \\times 8192\\).\n     - This is a straightforward multiplication, but it can be broken down if needed:\n       - Use the distributive property or a calculator for precise calculation.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - \\(22515 \\times 8192 = 184528896\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The result of \\(-5 \\times -79 \\times 57 \\times 8192\\) is \\(184528896\\).\n\n**Answer:** 184528896"
