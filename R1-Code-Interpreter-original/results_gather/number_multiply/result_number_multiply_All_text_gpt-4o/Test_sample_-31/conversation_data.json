    "To solve the expression \\(7 \\times -705 \\times -6206\\), we need to follow the order of operations and carefully consider the signs involved in the multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 7, -705, and -6206.\n   - The signs are positive for 7, negative for -705, and negative for -6206.\n\n2. **Understand the multiplication of signs:**\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - First, multiply 7 by -705:\n     \\[\n     7 \\times -705 = -4935\n     \\]\n     The result is -4935 because a positive number multiplied by a negative number is negative.\n\n   - Next, multiply the result (-4935) by -6206:\n     \\[\n     -4935 \\times -6206\n     \\]\n     Since both numbers are negative, the result will be positive.\n\n4. **Calculate the final multiplication:**\n   - To find the product of -4935 and -6206, we multiply their absolute values:\n     \\[\n     4935 \\times 6206\n     \\]\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     4935 \\times 6206 = 30665110\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the final sign of the result:**\n   - Since we multiplied two negative numbers, the final result is positive.\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(7 \\times -705 \\times -6206\\) is 30665110.\n\n**Answer: 30665110**"
