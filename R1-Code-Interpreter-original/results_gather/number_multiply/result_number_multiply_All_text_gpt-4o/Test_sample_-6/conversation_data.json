    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(6 \\times 78 \\times -24 \\times -5459\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach, considering the properties of multiplication and the signs of the numbers involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers and Their Signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are 6, 78, -24, and -5459.\n   - The signs are positive for 6 and 78, and negative for -24 and -5459.\n\n2. **Understand the Effect of Multiplying Negative Numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Calculate the Product of the First Two Numbers:**\n   - Multiply 6 and 78:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 78 = 468\n     \\]\n   - The result is positive because both numbers are positive.\n\n4. **Calculate the Product of the Next Two Numbers:**\n   - Multiply -24 and -5459:\n     \\[\n     -24 \\times -5459 = 131016\n     \\]\n   - The result is positive because both numbers are negative.\n\n5. **Multiply the Results from the Previous Steps:**\n   - Now, multiply the results from steps 3 and 4:\n     \\[\n     468 \\times 131016\n     \\]\n   - Both numbers are positive, so the result will be positive.\n\n6. **Perform the Final Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate the final product:\n     \\[\n     468 \\times 131016 = 61315588\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe result of the expression \\(6 \\times 78 \\times -24 \\times -5459\\) is 61315588.\n\n**Answer:** 61315588"
