    "To solve the problem \\(-4 \\times 631 \\times -3740\\), we need to follow the order of operations and carefully consider the signs of the numbers involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their signs:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-4\\), \\(631\\), and \\(-3740\\).\n   - The signs are negative for \\(-4\\) and \\(-3740\\), and positive for \\(631\\).\n\n2. **Understand the multiplication of negative numbers:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative product.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-4 \\times 631\\).\n     - Since one number is negative and the other is positive, the result will be negative.\n     - Calculate the absolute value: \\(4 \\times 631 = 2524\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(-4 \\times 631 = -2524\\).\n\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-2524 \\times -3740\\).\n     - Both numbers are negative, so the result will be positive.\n     - Calculate the absolute value: \\(2524 \\times 3740\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the final product:**\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(2524 \\times 3740\\).\n   - Break it down into smaller steps if necessary:\n     - \\(2524 \\times 3740 = 2524 \\times (3000 + 700 + 40)\\).\n     - Calculate each part:\n       - \\(2524 \\times 3000 = 7572000\\).\n       - \\(2524 \\times 700 = 1766800\\).\n       - \\(2524 \\times 40 = 100960\\).\n     - Add these results together:\n       - \\(7572000 + 1766800 + 100960 = 9439760\\).\n\n5. **Determine the final sign of the result:**\n   - Since the multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number, the final result is positive.\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-4 \\times 631 \\times -3740\\) is \\(9439760\\).\n\n**Answer:** 9439760"
