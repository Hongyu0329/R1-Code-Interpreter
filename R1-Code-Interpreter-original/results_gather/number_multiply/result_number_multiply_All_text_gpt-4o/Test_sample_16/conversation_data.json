  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\(6 \\times -43 \\times 3104\\). Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 6, -43, and 3104. The operations involved are multiplication.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can perform the operations in any order. However, for clarity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: \n   - Multiply 6 by -43.\n   - \\(6 \\times -43 = -258\\).\n   - The result is negative because a positive number multiplied by a negative number yields a negative result.\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**:\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by 3104.\n   - \\(-258 \\times 3104\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(-258 \\times 3104\\)**:\n   - First, calculate the absolute values: \\(258 \\times 3104\\).\n   - Break it down further if needed:\n     - \\(258 \\times 3104\\) can be calculated using long multiplication or a calculator.\n     - The result of \\(258 \\times 3104\\) is 801,632.\n   - Since the original multiplication involved a negative number, the final result will be negative.\n\n6. **Final Result**:\n   - The result of \\(-258 \\times 3104\\) is \\(-801,632\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression \\(6 \\times -43 \\times 3104\\) is \\(-801,632\\).\n\n**Answer**: -801,632"
