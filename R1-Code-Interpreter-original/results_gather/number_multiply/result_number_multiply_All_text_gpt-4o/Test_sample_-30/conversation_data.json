  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-8 \\times -981 \\times -8869\\), we need to carefully consider the properties of multiplication, especially when dealing with negative numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Sign Rule for Multiplication**:\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Calculate the Product Step by Step**:\n   - First, calculate the product of the first two numbers: \\(-8 \\times -981\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, their product will be positive.\n     - \\(-8 \\times -981 = 8 \\times 981\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(8 \\times 981\\):\n     - \\(8 \\times 981 = 7848\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the Result by the Third Number**:\n   - Now, multiply the result by the third number: \\(7848 \\times -8869\\).\n   - Since 7848 is positive and -8869 is negative, the product will be negative.\n\n5. **Perform the Final Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(7848 \\times 8869\\):\n     - This is a straightforward multiplication of two positive numbers.\n     - The result of this multiplication is 695,474,712.\n\n6. **Apply the Sign**:\n   - Since the multiplication involves a positive number and a negative number, the final result will be negative.\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-8 \\times -981 \\times -8869\\) is \\(-695,474,712\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(-695,474,712\\)"
