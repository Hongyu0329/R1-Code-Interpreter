    "To solve the problem \\(-7 \\times -43 \\times -81 \\times 8355\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of negative and positive numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - The numbers involved are \\(-7\\), \\(-43\\), \\(-81\\), and \\(8355\\).\n   - Three of these numbers are negative: \\(-7\\), \\(-43\\), and \\(-81\\).\n   - One number is positive: \\(8355\\).\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - Since there are three negative numbers, the product of these three will be negative (because the product of two negatives is positive, and then multiplying by another negative makes it negative again).\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value of the product:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     \\[\n     7 \\times 43 \\times 81 \\times 8355\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - Calculate \\(7 \\times 43\\):\n     \\[\n     7 \\times 43 = 301\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(301 \\times 81\\):\n     \\[\n     301 \\times 81 = 24381\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(24381 \\times 8355\\):\n     \\[\n     24381 \\times 8355 = 203497755\n     \\]\n\n5. **Apply the sign to the final product:**\n   - Since the product of the three negative numbers is negative, the final result will be negative.\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-7 \\times -43 \\times -81 \\times 8355\\) is \\(-203497755\\).\n\n**Final Answer: -203497755**"
