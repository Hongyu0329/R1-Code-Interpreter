    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-8 \\times -981 \\times -8869\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of negative numbers and the rules that govern them. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Negative Multiplication:**\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-8\\) and \\(-981\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, their product will be positive.\n     - Calculate: \\(-8 \\times -981 = 7848\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the Result with the Third Number:**\n   - Now, take the result from the first multiplication, which is \\(7848\\), and multiply it by the third number, \\(-8869\\).\n   - Since \\(7848\\) is positive and \\(-8869\\) is negative, the product will be negative.\n   - Calculate: \\(7848 \\times -8869 = -69650952\\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication \\(-8 \\times -981 \\times -8869\\) is \\(-69650952\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(-8 \\times -981 \\times -8869\\) is \\(-69650952\\)."
