  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(6 \\times 61 \\times 69 \\times -8163\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to multiply four numbers together: 6, 61, 69, and -8163. The presence of a negative number (-8163) indicates that the final result will be negative, as multiplying an odd number of negative numbers results in a negative product.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can multiply these numbers in any order. However, for simplicity, we will multiply them sequentially from left to right.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 61 = 366\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the result by the third number:\n     \\[\n     366 \\times 69 = 25254\n     \\]\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number, which is negative:\n     \\[\n     25254 \\times -8163 = -206,086,602\n     \\]\n\n4. **Sign of the Result**: Since we are multiplying three positive numbers and one negative number, the result will be negative.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The result of the multiplication \\(6 \\times 61 \\times 69 \\times -8163\\) is \\(-206,086,602\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n-206,086,602\n\\]"
