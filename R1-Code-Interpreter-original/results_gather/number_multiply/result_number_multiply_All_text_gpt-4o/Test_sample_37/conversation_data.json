    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(6 \\times -855 \\times 9265\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression involves three numbers: 6, -855, and 9265. The operations involved are multiplication.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: Since multiplication is associative, we can perform the operations in any order. However, for simplicity, we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Multiplication**: Start by multiplying the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times -855\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(6 \\times 855\\):\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 855 = 5130\n     \\]\n   - Since one of the numbers is negative, the result will be negative:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times -855 = -5130\n     \\]\n\n4. **Second Multiplication**: Now multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number:\n   \\[\n   -5130 \\times 9265\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(5130 \\times 9265\\):\n     - Break it down into smaller parts if necessary, or use a calculator for precision:\n     \\[\n     5130 \\times 9265 = 47514450\n     \\]\n   - Since the first number is negative, the result will be negative:\n     \\[\n     -5130 \\times 9265 = -47514450\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Result**: The final result of the expression \\(6 \\times -855 \\times 9265\\) is:\n   \\[\n   -47514450\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of \\(6 \\times -855 \\times 9265\\) is \\(-47514450\\)."
