    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 848 \\times -4287\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply three numbers: 8, 848, and -4287.\n   - The multiplication involves a negative number, which will affect the sign of the result.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:**\n   - Multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which we perform the multiplication does not affect the final result.\n   - We can choose to multiply any two numbers first and then multiply the result by the third number.\n\n3. **Calculate the Product of the First Two Numbers:**\n   - First, multiply 8 by 848.\n   - \\(8 \\times 848 = 6784\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the Result by the Third Number:**\n   - Now, multiply the result from the previous step by -4287.\n   - \\(6784 \\times -4287\\).\n\n5. **Consider the Sign:**\n   - Since we are multiplying a positive number (6784) by a negative number (-4287), the result will be negative.\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate \\(6784 \\times 4287\\) without considering the sign first.\n   - Use long multiplication or a calculator to find the product.\n   - The product of 6784 and 4287 is 29071584.\n\n7. **Apply the Sign:**\n   - Since the multiplication involves a negative number, the final result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result of \\(8 \\times 848 \\times -4287\\) is \\(-29071584\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n-29071584"
