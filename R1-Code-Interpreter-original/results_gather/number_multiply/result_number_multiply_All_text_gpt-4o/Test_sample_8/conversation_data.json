    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-8 \\times 52 \\times 5115\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply three numbers: \\(-8\\), \\(52\\), and \\(5115\\).\n\n2. **Consider the Sign:**\n   - The multiplication involves a negative number (\\(-8\\)). \n   - The product of a negative number and two positive numbers will be negative.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - We can multiply the numbers in any order due to the commutative property of multiplication. However, for simplicity, we will multiply them sequentially.\n\n4. **First Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the first two numbers: \\(-8 \\times 52\\).\n   - Calculate: \n     \\[\n     -8 \\times 52 = -416\n     \\]\n   - The result is \\(-416\\).\n\n5. **Second Multiplication:**\n   - Now, multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third number: \\(-416 \\times 5115\\).\n   - Calculate:\n     \\[\n     -416 \\times 5115 = -2121840\n     \\]\n   - The result is \\(-2121840\\).\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication \\(-8 \\times 52 \\times 5115\\) is \\(-2121840\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe result of \\(-8 \\times 52 \\times 5115\\) is \\(-2121840\\)."
