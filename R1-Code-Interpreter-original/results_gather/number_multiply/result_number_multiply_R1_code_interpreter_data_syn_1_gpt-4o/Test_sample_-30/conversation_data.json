    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-8 \\times -981 \\times -8869\\), we need to consider the multiplication of three negative numbers. \n\n1. **Understanding the Sign Rule**: \n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-8 \\times -981\\).\n   - The result will be positive because both numbers are negative.\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third number, \\(-8869\\).\n   - The final result will be negative because we are multiplying a positive number by a negative number.\n\n3. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   - We can use Python to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the three numbers\nresult = -8 * -981 * -8869\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -8*-981*-8869?",
