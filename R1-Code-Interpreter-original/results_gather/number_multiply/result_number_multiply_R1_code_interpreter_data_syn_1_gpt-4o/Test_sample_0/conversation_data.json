    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-4 \\times 17 \\times 7571\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the first two numbers: \\(-4 \\times 17\\).\n2. Take the result from step 1 and multiply it by the third number, 7571.\n\nBy following these steps, we can compute the final result. Let's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiply -4 and 17\nresult_step1 = -4 * 17\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result of step 1 with 7571\nfinal_result = result_step1 * 7571\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the multiplication \\(-4 \\times 17 \\times 7571\\) is \\(-514828\\).\n\n<<<The result of -4 * 17 * 7571 is -514828.>>>"
