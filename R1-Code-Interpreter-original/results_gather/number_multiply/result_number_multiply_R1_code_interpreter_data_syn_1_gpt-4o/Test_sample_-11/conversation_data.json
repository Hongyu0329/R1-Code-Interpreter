    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-3 \\times 71 \\times -18 \\times -3287\\), we need to consider the multiplication of these four numbers, taking into account the signs of each number.\n\n1. **Identify the signs**: \n   - The first number is \\(-3\\), which is negative.\n   - The second number is \\(71\\), which is positive.\n   - The third number is \\(-18\\), which is negative.\n   - The fourth number is \\(-3287\\), which is negative.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign**:\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, the product of \\(-3\\) and \\(71\\) is negative.\n   - The product of \\(-18\\) and \\(-3287\\) is positive.\n   - Finally, multiplying a negative number by a positive number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value of the product**:\n   - We will calculate the absolute value of the product of these numbers and then apply the sign determined in step 2.\n\nLet's compute the result using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the numbers\nresult = -3 * 71 * -18 * -3287\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(-3 \\times 71 \\times -18 \\times -3287\\) results in \\(-12602358\\). \n\nThe reasoning behind this is as follows:\n- The product of \\(-3\\) and \\(71\\) is \\(-213\\).\n- The product of \\(-18\\) and \\(-3287\\) is \\(59166\\).\n- Finally, multiplying \\(-213\\) by \\(59166\\) gives \\(-12602358\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-12602358>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -3*71*-18*-3287?",
