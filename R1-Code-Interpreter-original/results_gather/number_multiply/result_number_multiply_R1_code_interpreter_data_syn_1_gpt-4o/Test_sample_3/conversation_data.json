    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(7 \\times -29 \\times -1186\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.\n\n1. **Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: \n   - When you multiply two negative numbers, the result is positive.\n   - When you multiply a positive number by a negative number, the result is negative.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**:\n   - We can multiply in any order since multiplication is associative and commutative.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n- First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(7 \\times -29\\).\n- Then, multiply the result by \\(-1186\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the multiplication\nresult = 7 * -29 * -1186\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of \\(7 \\times -29 \\times -1186\\) results in 240758. The multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number, and multiplying that positive number by a positive number gives a positive result.\n\n<<<240758>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 7*-29*-1186?",
