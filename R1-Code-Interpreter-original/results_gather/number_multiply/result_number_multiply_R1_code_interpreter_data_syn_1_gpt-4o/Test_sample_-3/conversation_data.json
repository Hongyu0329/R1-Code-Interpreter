    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-7 \\times -43 \\times -81 \\times 8355\\), we need to consider the properties of multiplication, especially with negative numbers.\n\n1. **Understanding Negative Multiplication**:\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-7 \\times -43\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by \\(-81\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the result by \\(8355\\).\n\n3. **Sign Analysis**:\n   - \\(-7 \\times -43\\) will yield a positive result.\n   - Multiplying this positive result by \\(-81\\) will yield a negative result.\n   - Finally, multiplying this negative result by \\(8355\\) will yield a negative result.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation\nresult = -7 * -43 * -81 * 8355\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation has been executed correctly, and the result of the multiplication \\(-7 \\times -43 \\times -81 \\times 8355\\) is \\(-203703255\\).\n\n<<<The result of -7 * -43 * -81 * 8355 is -203703255.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -7*-43*-81*8355?",
