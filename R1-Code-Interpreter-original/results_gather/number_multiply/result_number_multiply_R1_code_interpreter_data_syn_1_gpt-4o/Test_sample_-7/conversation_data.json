    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-5 \\times -79 \\times 57 \\times 8192\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The expression involves multiplication of four numbers. The multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number. Therefore, the product of \\(-5\\) and \\(-79\\) will be positive.\n\n2. **Calculate step-by-step**:\n   - First, calculate the product of the first two numbers: \\(-5 \\times -79\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 57.\n   - Finally, multiply the result by 8192.\n\n3. **Use Python for calculation**: We can use Python to perform these calculations efficiently and accurately.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the numbers\nresult = -5 * -79 * 57 * 8192\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation of \\(-5 \\times -79 \\times 57 \\times 8192\\) results in 184442880. \n\nThe steps involved were:\n- Multiplying \\(-5\\) and \\(-79\\) gives a positive result because the product of two negative numbers is positive.\n- Continuing the multiplication with 57 and then 8192 gives the final result.\n\n<<<184442880>>>"
