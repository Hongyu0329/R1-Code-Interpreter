    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 939 \\times -8489\\), we can break it down into steps:\n\n1. First, multiply 8 by 939.\n2. Then, take the result and multiply it by -8489.\n\nThis will give us the final result. Let's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiply 8 by 939\nfirst_result = 8 * 939\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by -8489\nfinal_result = first_result * -8489\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
