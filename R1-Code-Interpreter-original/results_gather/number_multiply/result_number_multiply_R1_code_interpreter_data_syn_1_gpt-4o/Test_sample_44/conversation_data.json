    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-2 \\times 78 \\times -61 \\times -5850\\), we need to consider the multiplication of these four numbers, taking into account the signs of each number.\n\n1. **Identify the signs**: \n   - The numbers are \\(-2\\), \\(78\\), \\(-61\\), and \\(-5850\\).\n   - Negative numbers: \\(-2\\), \\(-61\\), \\(-5850\\).\n   - Positive number: \\(78\\).\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign**:\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying three negative numbers and one positive number will result in a negative number.\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value**:\n   - We will calculate the absolute value of the product and then apply the sign determined in step 2.\n\nLet's compute the product using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the numbers\nresult = -2 * 78 * -61 * -5850\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -2*78*-61*-5850?",
