    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(8 \\times -42 \\times 72 \\times -4704\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward multiplication.\n\n1. **Identify the signs**: \n   - The expression has four numbers: 8, -42, 72, and -4704.\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying four numbers with two negative signs will result in a positive number.\n\n2. **Calculate the product**:\n   - We can multiply the numbers step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's compute the result using Python to ensure precision and efficiency.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 8\nb = -42\nc = 72\nd = -4704\n\n# Calculate the product\nresult = a * b * c * d\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the result of the multiplication. The expression \\(8 \\times -42 \\times 72 \\times -4704\\) evaluates to 113,799,168.\n\n<<<113799168>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 8*-42*72*-4704?",
