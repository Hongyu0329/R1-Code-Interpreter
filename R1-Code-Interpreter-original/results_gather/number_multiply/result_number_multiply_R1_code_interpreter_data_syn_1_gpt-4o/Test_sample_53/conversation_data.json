    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-5 \\times -79 \\times 57 \\times 8192\\), we need to follow the order of operations and multiply the numbers together. \n\n1. **Understanding the Expression**: \n   - The expression involves four numbers: -5, -79, 57, and 8192.\n   - Multiplication is associative, so we can multiply these numbers in any order.\n\n2. **Handling Negative Signs**:\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive and a negative number is negative.\n   - In this expression, there are two negative numbers (-5 and -79), so their product will be positive.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - First, calculate the product of the two negative numbers: \\(-5 \\times -79\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 57.\n   - Finally, multiply that result by 8192.\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the numbers\nresult = -5 * -79 * 57 * 8192\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(-5 \\times -79 \\times 57 \\times 8192\\) results in 184,442,880. \n\nThe steps involved were:\n- Multiplying the two negative numbers \\(-5\\) and \\(-79\\) to get a positive result.\n- Continuing the multiplication with the remaining positive numbers, 57 and 8192.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is:\n\n<<<184442880>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -5*-79*57*8192?",
