    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(7 \\times -31 \\times 70 \\times -9705\\), we need to follow the order of operations and multiply the numbers together. \n\n1. **Identify the signs**: \n   - The expression has four numbers: 7, -31, 70, and -9705.\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying four numbers with two negative signs will result in a positive number.\n\n2. **Calculate the product**:\n   - We can multiply the numbers in any order due to the commutative property of multiplication.\n   - Let's compute the product step by step.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this product:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 7\nb = -31\nc = 70\nd = -9705\n\n# Calculate the product\nresult = a * b * c * d\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the product of the four numbers and print the result. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
