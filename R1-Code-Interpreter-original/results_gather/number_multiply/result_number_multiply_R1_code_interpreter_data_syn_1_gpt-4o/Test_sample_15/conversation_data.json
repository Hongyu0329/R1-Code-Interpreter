    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(4 \\times -97 \\times 9373\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. The multiplication involves:\n\n1. Multiplying 4 by -97.\n2. Taking the result from step 1 and multiplying it by 9373.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiply 4 by -97\nresult_step1 = 4 * -97\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result of step 1 by 9373\nfinal_result = result_step1 * 9373\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly. The result of multiplying \\(4 \\times -97 \\times 9373\\) is \\(-3,636,724\\).\n\n<<<-3,636,724>>>"
