  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(3 \\times -190 \\times -8028\\), we need to follow the order of operations for multiplication. \n\n1. **Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive. Therefore, \\(-190 \\times -8028\\) will yield a positive result.\n\n2. **Multiplication with a Positive Number**: The result from the first step will then be multiplied by 3, which is a positive number. Multiplying a positive number by another positive number will yield a positive result.\n\nLet's calculate the result using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of 3 * -190 * -8028\nresult = 3 * -190 * -8028\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of \\(3 \\times -190 \\times -8028\\) results in 4,575,960. The steps involved were:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-190\\) by \\(-8028\\), which results in a positive number.\n2. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4575960>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 3*-190*-8028?",
