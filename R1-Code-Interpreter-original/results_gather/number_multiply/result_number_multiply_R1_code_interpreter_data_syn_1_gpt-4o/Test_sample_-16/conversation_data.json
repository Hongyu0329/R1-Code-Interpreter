  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-2 \\times 78 \\times -61 \\times -5850\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is multiplication in this case. \n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. Multiply the first two numbers: \\(-2 \\times 78\\).\n2. Multiply the result by the third number: \\(-61\\).\n3. Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-5850\\).\n\nThe presence of negative signs will affect the sign of the result. Specifically, multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number, while multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation\nresult = -2 * 78 * -61 * -5850\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The result of the expression \\(-2 \\times 78 \\times -61 \\times -5850\\) is \\(-55,668,600\\).\n\n<<<-55668600>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -2*78*-61*-5850?",
