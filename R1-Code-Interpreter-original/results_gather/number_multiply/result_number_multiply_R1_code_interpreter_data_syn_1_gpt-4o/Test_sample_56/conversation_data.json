    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(8 \\times -42 \\times 72 \\times -4704\\), we need to consider the multiplication of these numbers, taking into account the signs of each number.\n\n1. **Identify the signs**: \n   - 8 is positive.\n   - -42 is negative.\n   - 72 is positive.\n   - -4704 is negative.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign**:\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, the product of these four numbers will be positive because there are two negative numbers.\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute value of the product**:\n   - We will multiply the absolute values of these numbers: \\(8 \\times 42 \\times 72 \\times 4704\\).\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the absolute values\nresult = 8 * 42 * 72 * 4704\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(8 \\times -42 \\times 72 \\times -4704\\) results in a positive number because the product of two negative numbers is positive. The absolute value of the product is calculated as \\(8 \\times 42 \\times 72 \\times 4704\\), which equals 113799168.\n\n<<<113799168>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 8*-42*72*-4704?",
