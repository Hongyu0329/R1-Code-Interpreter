    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(6 \\times -56 \\times 20 \\times 1761\\), we need to perform a series of multiplications. The expression involves four numbers: 6, -56, 20, and 1761. The presence of a negative number (-56) will affect the sign of the final result.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step by step:\n\n1. Multiply 6 by -56.\n2. Multiply the result by 20.\n3. Finally, multiply that result by 1761.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and efficiency, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 6\nb = -56\nc = 20\nd = 1761\n\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = a * b * c * d\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The result of the expression \\(6 \\times -56 \\times 20 \\times 1761\\) is \\(-11,833,920\\).\n\n<<<-11833920>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 6*-56*20*1761?",
