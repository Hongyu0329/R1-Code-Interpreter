  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(4 \\times 81 \\times -2185\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. \n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. First, multiply 4 by 81.\n2. Then, take the result and multiply it by -2185.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and efficiency, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of 4 * 81 * -2185\nresult = 4 * 81 * -2185\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly, and the result of \\(4 \\times 81 \\times -2185\\) is \\(-707940\\).\n\n<<<The result of 4 * 81 * -2185 is -707940.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 4*81*-2185?",
