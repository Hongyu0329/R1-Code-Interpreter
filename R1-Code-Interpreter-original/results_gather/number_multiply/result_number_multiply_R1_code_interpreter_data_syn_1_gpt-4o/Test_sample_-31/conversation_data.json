    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(7 \\times (-705) \\times (-6206)\\), we need to follow the order of operations and multiplication rules, especially considering the negative signs.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: \n   - When two negative numbers are multiplied, the result is positive. \n   - Therefore, \\((-705) \\times (-6206)\\) will yield a positive result.\n\n2. **Multiplication with a Positive Number**:\n   - The result from the above step will be multiplied by 7, which is a positive number. \n   - Multiplying a positive number by another positive number results in a positive number.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - First, calculate \\((-705) \\times (-6206)\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 7.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the expression\nresult = 7 * (-705) * (-6206)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly. The result of the expression \\(7 \\times (-705) \\times (-6206)\\) is 30,626,610.\n\n<<<30,626,610>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 7*-705*-6206?",
