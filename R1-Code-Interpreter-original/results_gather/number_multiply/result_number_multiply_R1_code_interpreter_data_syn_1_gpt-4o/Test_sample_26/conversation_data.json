    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-2 \\times 626 \\times 7127\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. The multiplication involves:\n\n1. Multiplying 626 by 7127.\n2. Multiplying the result by -2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the numbers\nresult = -2 * 626 * 7127\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
