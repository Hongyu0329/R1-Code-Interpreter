    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-3 \\times 71 \\times -18 \\times -3287\\), we need to consider the multiplication of these four numbers, taking into account the signs of each number.\n\n1. **Understanding the Signs:**\n   - The expression has four numbers: -3, 71, -18, and -3287.\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying four numbers with two negative signs will result in a positive number.\n\n2. **Calculation Steps:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-3 \\times 71\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third number: \\((\\text{result of first multiplication}) \\times -18\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\((\\text{result of second multiplication}) \\times -3287\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = -3\nb = 71\nc = -18\nd = -3287\n\n# Perform the multiplication step-by-step\nresult = a * b * c * d\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(-3 \\times 71 \\times -18 \\times -3287\\) is \\(-12,602,358\\).\n\nGiven the multiplication of four numbers with two negative signs, the final result is negative, which aligns with the rules of multiplication for negative numbers.\n\n<<<The result of the expression -3 * 71 * -18 * -3287 is -12,602,358.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -3*71*-18*-3287?",
