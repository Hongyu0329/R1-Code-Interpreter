    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(-7 \\times -43 \\times -81 \\times 8355\\), we need to consider the properties of multiplication, especially with negative numbers.\n\n1. **Understanding Negative Multiplication**: \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-7 \\times -43\\). Since both numbers are negative, the result will be positive.\n   - Next, multiply the result by \\(-81\\). Since the result from the first multiplication is positive, multiplying it by a negative number will yield a negative result.\n   - Finally, multiply the result by \\(8355\\). Since the result from the previous step is negative, the final result will be negative.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - We will perform the calculation using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\nresult = -7 * -43 * -81 * 8355\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly, and the result of the multiplication \\(-7 \\times -43 \\times -81 \\times 8355\\) is \\(-203703255\\).\n\n<<<The result of the multiplication -7 * -43 * -81 * 8355 is -203703255.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -7*-43*-81*8355?",
