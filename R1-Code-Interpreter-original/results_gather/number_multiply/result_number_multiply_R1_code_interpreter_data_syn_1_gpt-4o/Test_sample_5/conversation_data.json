  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-4 \\times 72 \\times 9767\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Multiply -4 by 72.\n2. Take the result from step 1 and multiply it by 9767.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and efficiency, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of -4 * 72 * 9767\nresult = -4 * 72 * 9767\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly, and the result of \\(-4 \\times 72 \\times 9767\\) is \\(-2,812,896\\).\n\n<<<-2812896>>>"
