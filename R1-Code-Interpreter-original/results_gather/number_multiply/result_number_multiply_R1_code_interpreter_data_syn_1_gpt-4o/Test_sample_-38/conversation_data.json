  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(3 \\times -190 \\times -8028\\), we need to follow the order of operations for multiplication. The multiplication of three numbers can be done in any order due to the associative property of multiplication.\n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1. Multiply the first two numbers: \\(3 \\times -190\\).\n2. Multiply the result by the third number: \\(-8028\\).\n\nSince the multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number, the final result will be positive.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of 3 * -190 * -8028\nresult = 3 * -190 * -8028\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of \\(3 \\times -190 \\times -8028\\) results in 4,575,960. The multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number, and multiplying that by a positive number gives a positive result.\n\n<<<4575960>>>"
