    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is multiplication in this case. The expression involves four numbers being multiplied together, and we need to be careful with the signs.\n\n1. **Identify the signs**: \n   - The numbers involved are 5, -69, 90, and -9786.\n   - The expression has two negative numbers: -69 and -9786.\n\n2. **Determine the sign of the result**:\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a positive number results in a positive number.\n   - Therefore, the overall result will be positive.\n\n3. **Calculate the product**:\n   - We can multiply the numbers in sequence to find the result.\n\nLet's calculate the product using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the numbers\nresult = 5 * -69 * 90 * -9786\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(5 \\times -69 \\times 90 \\times -9786\\) results in 303,855,300. The multiplication of these numbers, considering the signs, leads to a positive result as explained in the reasoning.\n\n<<<303,855,300>>>"
