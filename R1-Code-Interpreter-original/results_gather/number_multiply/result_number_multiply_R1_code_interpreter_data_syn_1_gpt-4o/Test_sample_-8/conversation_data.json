    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-8 \\times -99 \\times -19 \\times 4872\\), we need to consider the multiplication of these numbers and the effect of the negative signs.\n\n1. **Understanding the Signs:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying three negative numbers will result in a negative number, and multiplying four negative numbers will result in a positive number.\n\n2. **Calculation Steps:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-8 \\times -99\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third number: \\((result) \\times -19\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\((result) \\times 4872\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the expression\nresult = -8 * -99 * -19 * 4872\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(-8 \\times -99 \\times -19 \\times 4872\\) results in \\(-73313856\\). This is because the multiplication of three negative numbers results in a negative number, and multiplying that by a positive number retains the negative sign.\n\n<<<The result of the expression -8 * -99 * -19 * 4872 is -73,313,856.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -8*-99*-19*4872?",
