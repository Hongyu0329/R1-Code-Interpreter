  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(6 \\times -855 \\times 9265\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. The expression involves multiplying a positive number by a negative number, which will result in a negative product.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Multiply 6 by -855.\n2. Multiply the result from step 1 by 9265.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and efficiency, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the expression 6 * -855 * 9265\nresult = 6 * -855 * 9265\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(6 \\times -855 \\times 9265\\) has been performed, and the result is \\(-47,529,450\\).\n\n<<<The result of the expression 6 * -855 * 9265 is -47,529,450.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 6*-855*9265?",
