    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(9 \\times -177 \\times -8301\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the signs**: \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the two negative numbers: \\(-177 \\times -8301\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 9.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the multiplication\nresult = 9 * -177 * -8301\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
