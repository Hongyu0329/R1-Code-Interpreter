    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-8 \\times 52 \\times 5115\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. The multiplication involves:\n\n1. Multiplying -8 by 52.\n2. Taking the result from step 1 and multiplying it by 5115.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of -8, 52, and 5115\nresult = -8 * 52 * 5115\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
