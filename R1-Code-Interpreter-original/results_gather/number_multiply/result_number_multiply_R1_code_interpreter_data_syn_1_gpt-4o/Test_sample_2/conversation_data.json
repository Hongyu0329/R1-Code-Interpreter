    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(8 \\times -76 \\times -6996\\), we need to follow the order of operations and multiply the numbers together. \n\n1. First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(8 \\times -76\\).\n2. Then, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-6996\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiply the first two numbers\nfirst_multiplication = 8 * -76\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by the third number\nresult = first_multiplication * -6996\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation has been executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(8 \\times -76 \\times -6996\\) is 4,253,568.\n\n<<<4253568>>>"
