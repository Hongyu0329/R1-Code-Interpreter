    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 14 \\times -63 \\times -2676\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the signs**: \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying four numbers where two are negative will result in a positive number.\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - We can multiply the numbers in pairs to simplify the calculation.\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(8 \\times 14\\).\n   - Then, multiply the next two numbers: \\(-63 \\times -2676\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the results of these two products.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the numbers\nresult = 8 * 14 * -63 * -2676\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the multiplication \\(8 \\times 14 \\times -63 \\times -2676\\) is 18,881,856. \n\n<<<18881856>>>"
