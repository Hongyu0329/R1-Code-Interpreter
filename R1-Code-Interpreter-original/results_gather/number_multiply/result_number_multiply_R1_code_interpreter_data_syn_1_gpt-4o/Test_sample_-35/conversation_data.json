  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(7 \\times -442 \\times 2319\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. The multiplication involves both positive and negative numbers, so we need to be careful with the signs.\n\n1. **Understanding the Signs**: \n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Therefore, multiplying three numbers where one is negative will result in a negative number.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**:\n   - We can multiply the numbers in any order due to the associative property of multiplication. However, for simplicity, we will multiply them in the order they are given: \\(7 \\times -442 \\times 2319\\).\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - First, calculate \\(7 \\times -442\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 2319.\n\nLet's perform the calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of 7 * -442 * 2319\nresult = 7 * -442 * 2319\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of \\(7 \\times -442 \\times 2319\\) results in \\(-7174986\\). \n\nThe multiplication was performed by first multiplying 7 by -442, resulting in a negative number, and then multiplying that result by 2319, which maintained the negative sign.\n\n<<<-7174986>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 7*-442*2319?",
