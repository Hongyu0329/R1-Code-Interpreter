    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-3 \\times -56 \\times -2644\\), we need to consider the properties of multiplication, especially with negative numbers.\n\n1. **Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: \n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-3 \\times -56\\).\n   - Since both numbers are negative, their product will be positive.\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third number, \\(-2644\\).\n   - Since the result from the first multiplication is positive and the third number is negative, the final result will be negative.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the three numbers\nresult = -3 * -56 * -2644\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly. The result of multiplying \\(-3 \\times -56 \\times -2644\\) is \\(-444192\\).\n\n<<<The result of -3 * -56 * -2644 is -444192.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -3*-56*-2644?",
