    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(3 \\times 11 \\times -1221\\), we need to follow the order of operations for multiplication. \n\n1. First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(3 \\times 11\\).\n2. Then, take the result and multiply it by the third number: \\(-1221\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiply the first two numbers\nfirst_multiplication = 3 * 11\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by the third number\nresult = first_multiplication * -1221\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation has been executed correctly. The result of multiplying \\(3 \\times 11 \\times -1221\\) is \\(-40293\\).\n\n<<<-40293>>>"
