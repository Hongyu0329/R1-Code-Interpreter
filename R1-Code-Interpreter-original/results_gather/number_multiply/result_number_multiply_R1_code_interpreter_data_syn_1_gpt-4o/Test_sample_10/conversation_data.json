    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-5 \\times 80 \\times 8674\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the first two numbers: \\(-5 \\times 80\\).\n2. Take the result from step 1 and multiply it by the third number: \\(\\text{result from step 1} \\times 8674\\).\n\nWe can use Python to perform this calculation efficiently. Let's write a simple script to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of -5 * 80 * 8674\nresult = -5 * 80 * 8674\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will compute the product of the three numbers and print the result. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The calculation of \\(-5 \\times 80 \\times 8674\\) results in \\(-3,469,600\\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-3469600>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -5*80*8674?",
