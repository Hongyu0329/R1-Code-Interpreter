  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(6 \\times -43 \\times 3104\\), we need to perform a straightforward multiplication of these three numbers. The expression involves multiplying a positive number by a negative number, which will result in a negative product.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Multiply 6 by -43.\n2. Take the result from step 1 and multiply it by 3104.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and efficiency, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the expression 6 * -43 * 3104\nresult = 6 * -43 * 3104\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The calculation has been executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(6 \\times -43 \\times 3104\\) is \\(-800832\\).\n\n<<<-800832>>>"
