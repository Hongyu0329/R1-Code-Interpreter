    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-6 \\times -36 \\times 37 \\times -9305\\), we need to consider the multiplication of these four numbers, taking into account the signs of each number.\n\n1. **Sign Analysis**:\n   - The expression has four numbers: \\(-6\\), \\(-36\\), \\(37\\), and \\(-9305\\).\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - Therefore, the product of four numbers with three negative signs will be negative.\n\n2. **Magnitude Calculation**:\n   - We will calculate the magnitude of the product by multiplying the absolute values of the numbers: \\(6 \\times 36 \\times 37 \\times 9305\\).\n\nLet's compute the result using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the absolute values\nresult = 6 * 36 * 37 * 9305\n\n# Since there are three negative numbers, the final result will be negative\nfinal_result = -result\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression \\(-6 \\times -36 \\times 37 \\times -9305\\) as \\(-74365560\\). \n\nThe reasoning behind this is that the product of the absolute values of the numbers is \\(74365560\\), and since there are three negative numbers, the overall product is negative.\n\n<<<-74365560>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -6*-36*37*-9305?",
