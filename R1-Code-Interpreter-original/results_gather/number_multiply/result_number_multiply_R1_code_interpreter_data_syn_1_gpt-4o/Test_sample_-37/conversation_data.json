    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-4 \\times -464 \\times 7912\\), we need to follow the order of operations for multiplication. \n\n1. **Understanding the Signs**: \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number. \n   - Multiplying a positive number by a positive number results in a positive number.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - First, calculate \\(-4 \\times -464\\). Since both numbers are negative, the result will be positive.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 7912.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the expression\nresult = -4 * -464 * 7912\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The result of the multiplication \\(-4 \\times -464 \\times 7912\\) is 14,684,672.\n\n<<<14,684,672>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -4*-464*7912?",
