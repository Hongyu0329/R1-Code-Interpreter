    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the multiplication \\(-9 \\times 43 \\times -73 \\times -6061\\), we need to consider the properties of multiplication, especially with negative numbers.\n\n1. **Understanding the signs**: \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n2. **Step-by-step multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-9 \\times 43\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-73\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(-6061\\).\n\n3. **Sign analysis**:\n   - The product of the first two numbers will be negative.\n   - Multiplying this negative result by another negative number (\\(-73\\)) will yield a positive result.\n   - Finally, multiplying this positive result by another negative number (\\(-6061\\)) will yield a negative result.\n\nLet's compute the result using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = -9\nb = 43\nc = -73\nd = -6061\n\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = a * b * c * d\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the product of the four numbers and print the result. Let's execute it to find the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -9*43*-73*-6061?",
