    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-8 \\times -981 \\times -8869\\), we need to consider the multiplication of three negative numbers. \n\n1. **Understanding the Sign:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-8 \\times -981\\).\n   - The result will be positive because both numbers are negative.\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third number, \\(-8869\\).\n   - The final result will be negative because we are multiplying a positive number by a negative number.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of -8 * -981 * -8869\nresult = -8 * -981 * -8869\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of \\(-8 \\times -981 \\times -8869\\) results in \\(-69603912\\). This is because:\n\n1. \\(-8 \\times -981 = 7848\\) (a positive number since two negatives make a positive).\n2. \\(7848 \\times -8869 = -69603912\\) (a negative number since a positive times a negative is negative).\n\nThus, the final result of the multiplication is \\(-69603912\\).\n\n<<<-69603912>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -8*-981*-8869?",
