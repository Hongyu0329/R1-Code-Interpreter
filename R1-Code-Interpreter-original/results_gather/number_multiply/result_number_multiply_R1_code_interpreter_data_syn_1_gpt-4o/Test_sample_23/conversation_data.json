    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-4 \\times -464 \\times 7912\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The expression involves multiplication of three numbers: -4, -464, and 7912.\n\n2. **Consider the signs**: \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a positive number results in a positive number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the two negative numbers: \\(-4 \\times -464\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 7912.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the expression\nresult = -4 * -464 * 7912\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The result of the expression \\(-4 \\times -464 \\times 7912\\) is 14,684,672.\n\n<<<14684672>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -4*-464*7912?",
