    "To solve the problem of finding the result of the expression \\(-2 \\times -23 \\times -78 \\times -1578\\), we need to consider the properties of multiplication, especially with negative numbers.\n\n1. **Understanding Negative Multiplication**:\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-2 \\times -23\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third number: \\(\\text{result} \\times -78\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the last result by the fourth number: \\(\\text{result} \\times -1578\\).\n\n3. **Sign Analysis**:\n   - The product of the first two numbers will be positive.\n   - The product of the first three numbers will be negative (since a positive times a negative is negative).\n   - The final product will be positive (since a negative times a negative is positive).\n\nLet's calculate the result using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the numbers\nresult = -2 * -23 * -78 * -1578\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(-2 \\times -23 \\times -78 \\times -1578\\) results in 5,661,864. The process involved multiplying the numbers while considering the rules of multiplication for negative numbers, which ultimately led to a positive result.\n\n<<<5661864>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of -2*-23*-78*-1578?",
