  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(7 \\times -705 \\times -6206\\), we need to follow the order of operations and multiplication rules. \n\n1. **Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive. Therefore, \\(-705 \\times -6206\\) will yield a positive result.\n\n2. **Multiplication with a Positive Number**: The result from the first multiplication will then be multiplied by 7, which is a positive number. The final result will remain positive.\n\nNow, let's calculate the result using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of 7 * -705 * -6206\nresult = 7 * -705 * -6206\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The calculation has been executed successfully, and the result of \\(7 \\times -705 \\times -6206\\) is 30,626,610.\n\n<<<The result of 7 * -705 * -6206 is 30,626,610.>>>"
