    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(9 \\times -177 \\times -8301\\), we need to follow the order of operations and multiply the numbers together. \n\n1. **Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: \n   - When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive.\n   - When multiplying a positive number by a negative number, the result is negative.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(9 \\times -177\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third number: \\(-8301\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of 9 * -177 * -8301\nresult = 9 * -177 * -8301\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of \\(9 \\times -177 \\times -8301\\) results in 13,223,493. \n\nThe process involved multiplying the numbers step-by-step, taking into account the rules for multiplying negative numbers. The final result is positive because the product of two negative numbers is positive, and then multiplying by a positive number keeps the result positive.\n\n<<<The result of 9 * -177 * -8301 is 13,223,493.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the result of 9*-177*-8301?",
