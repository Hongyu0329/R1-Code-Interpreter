  "response_list": [
    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(5 \\times -26 \\times -7684\\), we need to follow the order of operations and multiplication rules. \n\n1. **Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive. Therefore, \\(-26 \\times -7684\\) will yield a positive result.\n\n2. **Multiplication with a Positive Number**: The result from the first step will then be multiplied by 5, which is a positive number. Multiplying a positive number by another positive number results in a positive number.\n\nLet's calculate the result using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of 5 * -26 * -7684\nresult = 5 * -26 * -7684\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of \\(5 \\times -26 \\times -7684\\) results in 998920. The multiplication of two negative numbers \\(-26\\) and \\(-7684\\) gives a positive result, and then multiplying by 5 gives the final positive result.\n\n<<<998920>>>"
