    "To solve the problem of finding the result of \\(-6 \\times 44 \\times -9255\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward multiplication.\n\n1. **Identify the signs**: \n   - The first number is \\(-6\\), which is negative.\n   - The second number is \\(44\\), which is positive.\n   - The third number is \\(-9255\\), which is negative.\n\n2. **Determine the sign of the result**:\n   - Multiplying two numbers with different signs results in a negative product.\n   - Multiplying the result of the first multiplication (which is negative) with another negative number results in a positive product.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply \\(-6\\) and \\(44\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by \\(-9255\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the multiplication\nresult = -6 * 44 * -9255\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
