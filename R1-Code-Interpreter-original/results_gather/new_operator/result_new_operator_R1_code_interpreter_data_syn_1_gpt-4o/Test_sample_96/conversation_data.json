    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)~5#6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations @, ~, and #.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 5 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3@4 = 5 \\times 3 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the result of the first operation:**\n   - Compute \\(3@4\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3@4)~5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 2 \\times a + 3 \\times b\\).\n   - Use the result from step 2 for \\(a\\) and 5 for \\(b\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the result of the second operation:**\n   - Compute \\((3@4)~5\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(((3@4)~5)#6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Use the result from step 4 for \\(a\\) and 6 for \\(b\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the final result:**\n   - Compute \\(((3@4)~5)#6\\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3@4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = 5 * a * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3@4)~5\nc = 5\nresult_2 = 2 * result_1 + 3 * c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3@4)~5)#6\nd = 6\nfinal_result = 1 * result_2 * d\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the values and symbols.",
