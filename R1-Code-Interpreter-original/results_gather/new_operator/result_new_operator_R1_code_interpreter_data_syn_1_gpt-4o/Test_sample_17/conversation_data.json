    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\((5@2)@6\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(5@2\\):**\n   \\[\n   5@2 = \\frac{5 + 2}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((5@2)@6\\):**\n   Now, we use the result from step 1:\n   \\[\n   3.5@6 = \\frac{3.5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{9.5}{6}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute the final result using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate 5@2\nresult_5_2 = operation(5, 2)\n\n# Calculate (5@2)@6\nfinal_result = operation(result_5_2, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\((5@2)@6\\).",
