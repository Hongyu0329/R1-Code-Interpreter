    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"$\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\$ b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a \\$ b = 4 \\times a + 4 \\times b \\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\((3 \\$ 7) \\$ 1\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 3 \\$ 7 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\$ 7 = 4 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((3 \\$ 7) \\$ 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (3 \\$ 7) \\$ 1 = 4 \\times (3 \\$ 7) + 4 \\times 1\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation\ndef custom_operation(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Calculate 3 $ 7\nresult_3_7 = custom_operation(3, 7)\n\n# Calculate (3 $ 7) $ 1\nfinal_result = custom_operation(result_3_7, 1)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\((3 \\$ 7) \\$ 1\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of the operation \\((3 \\$ 7) \\$ 1\\) as 164. \n\nLet's break down the steps to ensure the calculation is clear:\n\n1. Calculate \\(3 \\$ 7\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\$ 7 = 4 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 7 = 12 + 28 = 40\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((3 \\$ 7) \\$ 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (3 \\$ 7) \\$ 1 = 4 \\times 40 + 4 \\times 1 = 160 + 4 = 164\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\((3 \\$ 7) \\$ 1\\) is 164.\n\n<<<164>>>"
