    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as \\( 3 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\( (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 \\).\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 10 \\sim 10 \\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\sim 10 = 3 \\times 10 \\times 10\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 = 3 \\times (10 \\sim 10) \\times 3\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a ~ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\n# Calculate 10 ~ 10\nresult1 = operation(10, 10)\n\n# Calculate (10 ~ 10) ~ 3\nresult2 = operation(result1, 3)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result2)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\( (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of the operation \\( (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 \\) as 2700. \n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final answer:\n\n1. Calculate \\( 10 \\sim 10 \\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\sim 10 = 3 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 300\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\( (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 = 3 \\times 300 \\times 3 = 2700\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2700>>>"
