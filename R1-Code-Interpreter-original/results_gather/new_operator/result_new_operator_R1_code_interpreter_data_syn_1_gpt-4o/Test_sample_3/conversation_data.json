    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\& b = 2 \\times a \\times b \\). We are asked to calculate \\((7 \\& 5) \\& 9\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 7 \\& 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   7 \\& 5 = 2 \\times 7 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((7 \\& 5) \\& 9\\):\n   \\[\n   (7 \\& 5) \\& 9 = 2 \\times (7 \\& 5) \\times 9\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a & b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\n# Calculate 7 & 5\nresult_7_5 = operation(7, 5)\n\n# Calculate (7 & 5) & 9\nfinal_result = operation(result_7_5, 9)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\((7 \\& 5) \\& 9\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 1260. This means that the calculation for \\((7 \\& 5) \\& 9\\) is correct.\n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. Calculate \\( 7 \\& 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   7 \\& 5 = 2 \\times 7 \\times 5 = 70\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\((7 \\& 5) \\& 9\\):\n   \\[\n   (7 \\& 5) \\& 9 = 2 \\times 70 \\times 9 = 1260\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1260>>>"
