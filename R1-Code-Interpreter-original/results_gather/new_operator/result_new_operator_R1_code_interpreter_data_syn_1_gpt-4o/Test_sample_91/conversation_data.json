    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\& b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((3 \\& 2) \\& 3\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3 \\& 2\\):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\& 2 = \\frac{3 + 2}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((2.5) \\& 3\\):**\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\& 3 = \\frac{2.5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{5.5}{3} = \\frac{11}{6}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a & b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (3 & 2) & 3\nresult = operation(operation(3, 2), 3)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<11/6>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The result of \\((3 \\& 2) \\& 3\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{11}{6}\\), which is approximately 1.8333333333333333 in decimal form.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<11/6>>>"
