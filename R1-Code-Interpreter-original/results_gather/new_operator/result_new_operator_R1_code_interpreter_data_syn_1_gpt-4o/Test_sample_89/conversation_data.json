    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the custom operation defined as \\( a \\& b = 2 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((1 \\& 7) \\& 4\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\(1 \\& 7\\):\n   \\[\n   1 \\& 7 = 2 \\times 1 \\times 7 = 14\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\(14 \\& 4\\):\n   \\[\n   14 \\& 4 = 2 \\times 14 \\times 4 = 112\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((1 \\& 7) \\& 4\\) is 112.\n\nLet's verify this calculation using a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef custom_and(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\nresult = custom_and(custom_and(1, 7), 4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<112>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches the expected result. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<112>>>"
