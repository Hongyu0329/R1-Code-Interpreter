    "To solve the expression \\((3 \\sim 4) \\& 5 \\# 6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3 \\sim 4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a \\sim b = 3a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3 \\sim 4 = 3 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 9 + 4 = 13\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3 \\sim 4) \\& 5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a \\& b = 3ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 13\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     13 \\& 5 = 3 \\times 13 \\times 5 = 195\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3 \\sim 4) \\& 5 \\# 6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a \\# b = 1ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 195\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     195 \\# 6 = 1 \\times 195 \\times 6 = 1170\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to verify the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 1 * b\n\ndef operation_and(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3~4)&5#6\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_and = operation_and(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_hash = operation_hash(result_and, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_hash)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
