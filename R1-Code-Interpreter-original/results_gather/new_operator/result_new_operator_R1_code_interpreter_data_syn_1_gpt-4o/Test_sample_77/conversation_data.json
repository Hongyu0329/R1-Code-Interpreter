    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression (4@4)@7 using the given operation definition. The operation a@b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate 4@4.\n   - According to the definition, 4@4 = (4 + 4)/4.\n\n2. Next, we use the result from step 1 to calculate (4@4)@7.\n   - Let x = 4@4, then (4@4)@7 = x@7 = (x + 7)/7.\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 4@4\na = 4\nb = 4\nresult_4_at_4 = (a + b) / b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (4@4)@7\na = result_4_at_4\nb = 7\nresult_final = (a + b) / b\n\nprint(result_4_at_4, result_final)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the values for 4@4 and (4@4)@7. Let's proceed with the calculation.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the results for the calculations:\n\n1. 4@4 = 2.0\n2. (4@4)@7 = 1.2857142857142858\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the expression (4@4)@7 is:\n\n<<<2.0, 1.2857142857142858>>>"
