    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b\\) is calculated as \\(1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)\\$5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3~4 = 12\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b\\) is calculated as \\((a + b)/b\\).\n   - So, \\(12\\$5 = (12 + 5)/5 = 17/5 = 3.4\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3~4)\\$5 = 3.4\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b\\) is calculated as \\((a + b)/b\\).\n   - So, \\(3.4@6 = (3.4 + 6)/6 = 9.4/6\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the final result using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3~4)$5@6\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_at = operation_at(result_dollar, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_at)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\) as approximately 1.5666666666666667. \n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3~4\\):**  \n   \\[ 3~4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3~4)\\$5\\):**  \n   \\[ 12\\$5 = \\frac{12 + 5}{5} = \\frac{17}{5} = 3.4 \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\):**  \n   \\[ 3.4@6 = \\frac{3.4 + 6}{6} = \\frac{9.4}{6} \\approx 1.5666666666666667 \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\) is approximately 1.5666666666666667.\n\n<<<1.5666666666666667>>>"
