    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\%6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations provided:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**  \n   According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 4 \\times a \\times b\\).  \n   So, \\(3\\#4 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the result of the first operation:**  \n   We will compute \\(3\\#4\\) using the formula.\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\):**  \n   According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 3 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).  \n   We will use the result from step 1 for \\(a\\) and 5 for \\(b\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the result of the second operation:**  \n   We will compute \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\) using the formula.\n\n5. **Calculate \\(((3\\#4)\\sim5)\\%6\\):**  \n   According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = 4 \\times a \\times b\\).  \n   We will use the result from step 3 for \\(a\\) and 6 for \\(b\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the result of the third operation:**  \n   We will compute \\(((3\\#4)\\sim5)\\%6\\) using the formula.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3#4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = 4 * a * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3#4)~5\nc = 5\nresult_2 = 3 * result_1 + 5 * c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3#4)~5)%6\nd = 6\nresult_3 = 4 * result_2 * d\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the results.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the results for each step of the calculation. Let's break down the results:\n\n1. **\\(3\\#4 = 48\\):**  \n   This is calculated as \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 48\\).\n\n2. **\\((3\\#4)\\sim5 = 169\\):**  \n   Using the result from step 1, this is calculated as \\(3 \\times 48 + 5 \\times 5 = 144 + 25 = 169\\).\n\n3. **\\(((3\\#4)\\sim5)\\%6 = 4056\\):**  \n   Using the result from step 2, this is calculated as \\(4 \\times 169 \\times 6 = 4056\\).\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\%6\\) is 4056.\n\n<<<48, 169, 4056>>>"
