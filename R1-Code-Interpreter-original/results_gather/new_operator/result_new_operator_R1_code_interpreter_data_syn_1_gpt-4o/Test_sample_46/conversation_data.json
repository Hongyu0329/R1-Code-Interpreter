    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\((3&4)@5%6\\) using the defined operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3&4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3&4 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 36\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3&4)@5\\):**\n   - We already know \\(3&4 = 36\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(36@5 = \\frac{36 + 5}{5} = \\frac{41}{5} = 8.2\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3&4)@5%6\\):**\n   - We already know \\((3&4)@5 = 8.2\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a%b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(8.2%6 = \\frac{8.2 + 6}{6} = \\frac{14.2}{6}\\).\n\nNow, let's compute the final value using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_and(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3&4)@5%6\nresult_and = operation_and(3, 4)\nresult_at = operation_at(result_and, 5)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_at, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_percent)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression \\((3&4)@5%6\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the result for the expression \\((3&4)@5%6\\) as approximately 2.3667. \n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final answer:\n\n1. \\(3&4 = 36\\)\n2. \\((3&4)@5 = 8.2\\)\n3. \\((3&4)@5%6 = 2.3667\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<36, @, 8.2, %, 2.3667>>>"
