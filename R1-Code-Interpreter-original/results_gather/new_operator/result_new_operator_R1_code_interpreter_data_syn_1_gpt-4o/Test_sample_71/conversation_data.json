    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\# b = 4 \\times a \\times b \\). We are asked to calculate \\( (6 \\# 4) \\# 2 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 6 \\# 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\# 4 = 4 \\times 6 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (6 \\# 4) \\# 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   (6 \\# 4) \\# 2 = 4 \\times (6 \\# 4) \\times 2\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 6#4\na = 6\nb = 4\nresult_6_4 = 4 * a * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (6#4)#2\nc = 2\nfinal_result = 4 * result_6_4 * c\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final result for \\( (6 \\# 4) \\# 2 \\).",
