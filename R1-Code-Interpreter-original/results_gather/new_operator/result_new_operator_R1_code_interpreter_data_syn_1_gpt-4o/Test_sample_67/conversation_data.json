    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as \\( 5 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\((1 \\sim 10) \\sim 9\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 1 \\sim 10 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 \\sim 10 = 5 \\times 1 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( 50 \\sim 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   50 \\sim 9 = 5 \\times 50 \\times 9\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the final result using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 5 * a * b\n\n# Calculate (1~10)~9\nresult = operation(operation(1, 10), 9)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\((1 \\sim 10) \\sim 9\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of the operation \\((1 \\sim 10) \\sim 9\\) as 2250. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2250>>>"
