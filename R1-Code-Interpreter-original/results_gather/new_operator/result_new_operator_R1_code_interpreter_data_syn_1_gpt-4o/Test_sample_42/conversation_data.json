    "To solve the expression \\((3&4)#5~6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3&4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 4a + 3b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3&4 = 4 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3&4)#5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3&4 = 24\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = 3a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 24\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     24#5 = 3 \\times 24 + 2 \\times 5 = 72 + 10 = 82\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(((3&4)#5)~6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3&4)#5 = 82\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 1a + 4b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 82\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     82~6 = 1 \\times 82 + 4 \\times 6 = 82 + 24 = 106\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_and(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 3 * b\n\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 2 * b\n\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 1 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3&4)#5~6\nresult_and = operation_and(3, 4)\nresult_hash = operation_hash(result_and, 5)\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(result_hash, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_tilde)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm our calculations.",
