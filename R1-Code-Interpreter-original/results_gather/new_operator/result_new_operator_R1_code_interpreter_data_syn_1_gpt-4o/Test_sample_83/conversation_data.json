    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as \\( 1 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nLet's break down the expression \\((6 \\sim 1) \\sim 6\\):\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 6 \\sim 1 \\):\n   - Using the definition, \\( 6 \\sim 1 = 1 \\times 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\).\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((6 \\sim 1) \\sim 6\\):\n   - Substitute \\( 6 \\sim 1 = 6 \\) into the expression, so we have \\( 6 \\sim 6 \\).\n   - Using the definition again, \\( 6 \\sim 6 = 1 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\n# Calculate (6~1)~6\nresult = operation(operation(6, 1), 6)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<36>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches our manual calculation. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<36>>>"
