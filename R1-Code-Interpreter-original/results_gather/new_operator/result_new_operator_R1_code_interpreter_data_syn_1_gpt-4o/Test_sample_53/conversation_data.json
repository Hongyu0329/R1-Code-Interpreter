    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\((4@9)@3\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(4@9\\):**\n   \\[\n   4@9 = \\frac{4 + 9}{9} = \\frac{13}{9}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((4@9)@3\\):**\n   \\[\n   (4@9)@3 = \\left(\\frac{13}{9}\\right)@3 = \\frac{\\frac{13}{9} + 3}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   To simplify \\(\\frac{13}{9} + 3\\), we need a common denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13}{9} + 3 = \\frac{13}{9} + \\frac{27}{9} = \\frac{40}{9}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, substitute back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   (4@9)@3 = \\frac{\\frac{40}{9}}{3} = \\frac{40}{27}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a@b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate 4@9\nresult_4_9 = operation(4, 9)\n\n# Calculate (4@9)@3\nfinal_result = operation(result_4_9, 3)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result. Let's proceed with the execution.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is approximately 1.4814814814814816. This confirms our manual calculation.\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n1. Calculate \\(4@9 = \\frac{13}{9}\\).\n2. Calculate \\((4@9)@3 = \\frac{40}{27}\\).\n\nThe decimal representation of \\(\\frac{40}{27}\\) is approximately 1.4814814814814816.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<4@9 = 13/9, (4@9)@3 = 40/27, 40/27 = 1.4814814814814816>>>"
