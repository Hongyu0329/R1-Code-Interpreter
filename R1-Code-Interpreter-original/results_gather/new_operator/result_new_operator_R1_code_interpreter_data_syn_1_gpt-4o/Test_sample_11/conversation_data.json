    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as \\( 2a + 4b \\).\n\nWe need to calculate \\( (2 \\sim 9) \\sim 9 \\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 2 \\sim 9 \\):**\n   - Using the definition, \\( 2 \\sim 9 = 2 \\times 2 + 4 \\times 9 \\).\n\n2. **Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (2 \\sim 9) \\sim 9 \\):**\n   - Let \\( x = 2 \\sim 9 \\).\n   - Then, calculate \\( x \\sim 9 = 2x + 4 \\times 9 \\).\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a ~ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Calculate 2 ~ 9\nfirst_result = operation(2, 9)\n\n# Calculate (2 ~ 9) ~ 9\nfinal_result = operation(first_result, 9)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is 116. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 2 \\sim 9 \\):**\n   - \\( 2 \\sim 9 = 2 \\times 2 + 4 \\times 9 = 4 + 36 = 40 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( (2 \\sim 9) \\sim 9 \\):**\n   - Using the result from step 1, \\( 40 \\sim 9 = 2 \\times 40 + 4 \\times 9 = 80 + 36 = 116 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final result of \\( (2 \\sim 9) \\sim 9 \\) is 116.\n\n<<<116>>>"
