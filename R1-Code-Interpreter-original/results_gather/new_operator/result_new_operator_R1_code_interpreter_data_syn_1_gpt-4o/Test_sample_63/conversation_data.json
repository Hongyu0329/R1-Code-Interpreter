    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\# b = 2 \\times a + 1 \\times b \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((3 \\# 9) \\# 3\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\(3 \\# 9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\# 9 = 2 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 9 = 6 + 9 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\(15 \\# 3\\):\n   \\[\n   15 \\# 3 = 2 \\times 15 + 1 \\times 3 = 30 + 3 = 33\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\((3 \\# 9) \\# 3\\) is 33.\n\nLet's verify this calculation using a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef custom_operation(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 1 * b\n\n# Calculate (3#9)#3\nresult = custom_operation(custom_operation(3, 9), 3)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of \\((3 \\# 9) \\# 3\\) is indeed 33.\n\n<<<33>>>"
