    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)\\%5\\$6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)\\%5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - We already calculated \\(3~4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - So, \\((3~4)\\%5 = \\frac{\\frac{7}{4} + 5}{5}\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3~4)\\%5\\$6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 2 \\times a + 4 \\times b\\).\n   - We need to first calculate \\((3~4)\\%5\\) and then use it in the operation with 6.\n   - So, \\((3~4)\\%5\\$6 = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\frac{7}{4} + 5}{5}\\right) + 4 \\times 6\\).\n\nLet's compute these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Calculate step by step\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(result_percent, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_dollar)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression \\((3~4)\\%5\\$6\\) as 26.7. \n\nLet's break down the steps and confirm the calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - \\(3~4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3~4)\\%5\\):**\n   - \\((3~4)\\%5 = \\frac{1.75 + 5}{5} = \\frac{6.75}{5} = 1.35\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3~4)\\%5\\$6\\):**\n   - \\((3~4)\\%5\\$6 = 2 \\times 1.35 + 4 \\times 6 = 2.7 + 24 = 26.7\\).\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the code output.
