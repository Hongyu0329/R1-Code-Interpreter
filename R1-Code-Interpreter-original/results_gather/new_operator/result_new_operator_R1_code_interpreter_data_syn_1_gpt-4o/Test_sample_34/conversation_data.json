    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5@6\\) using the given operations:\n\n1. **Operation %**: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a\\%b\\) is defined as \\(3 \\times a + 3 \\times b\\).\n2. **Operation $**: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a\\$b\\) is defined as \\((a + b) / b\\).\n3. **Operation @**: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a@b\\) is defined as \\(5 \\times a + 1 \\times b\\).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\%4\\):**\n   \\[\n   3\\%4 = 3 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 4 = 9 + 12 = 21\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\):**\n   \\[\n   21\\$5 = (21 + 5) / 5 = 26 / 5 = 5.2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\%4)\\$5@6\\):**\n   \\[\n   5.2@6 = 5 \\times 5.2 + 1 \\times 6 = 26 + 6 = 32\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 3 * b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 1 * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3%4)$5@6\nresult_percent = operation_percent(3, 4)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(result_percent, 5)\nresult_at = operation_at(result_dollar, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_at)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result. Let's proceed with the execution.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculations. The final result of the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5@6\\) is 32.0.\n\n<<<32.0>>>"
