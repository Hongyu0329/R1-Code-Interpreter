    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)%5#6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3@4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3@4)%5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3@4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a%b = 4a + 4b\\).\n   - So, \\((3@4)%5 = 4 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 4 \\times 5\\).\n   - Simplifying, \\((3@4)%5 = 7 + 20 = 27\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3@4)%5#6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3@4)%5 = 27\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = 1a + 1b\\).\n   - So, \\((3@4)%5#6 = 1 \\times 27 + 1 \\times 6\\).\n   - Simplifying, \\((3@4)%5#6 = 27 + 6 = 33\\).\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 4 * b\n\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 1 * a + 1 * b\n\n# Calculate each step\nresult_at = operation_at(3, 4)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_at, 5)\nresult_hash = operation_hash(result_percent, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_hash)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm our calculations.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculations. The final result of the expression \\((3@4)%5#6\\) is 33. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<3@4 = 7/4, (3@4)%5 = 27, (3@4)%5#6 = 33>>>"
