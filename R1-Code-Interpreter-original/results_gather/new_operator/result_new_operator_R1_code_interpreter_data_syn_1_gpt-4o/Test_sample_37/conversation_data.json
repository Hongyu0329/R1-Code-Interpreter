    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as \\( 3a + 2b \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\( (10 \\sim 4) \\sim 3 \\).\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 10 \\sim 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\sim 4 = 3 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (10 \\sim 4) \\sim 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   (10 \\sim 4) \\sim 3 = 3 \\times (10 \\sim 4) + 2 \\times 3\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a ~ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Calculate 10 ~ 4\nresult1 = operation(10, 4)\n\n# Calculate (10 ~ 4) ~ 3\nresult2 = operation(result1, 3)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result2)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 120. This means that the calculation of \\((10 \\sim 4) \\sim 3\\) results in 120.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate \\(10 \\sim 4\\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\sim 4 = 3 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 4 = 30 + 8 = 38\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((10 \\sim 4) \\sim 3\\):\n   \\[\n   38 \\sim 3 = 3 \\times 38 + 2 \\times 3 = 114 + 6 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result is 120.\n\n<<<120>>>"
