    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the given operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\#4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 2a + 5b\\).\n   - So, \\((3\\#4)\\$5 = 2 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 5 \\times 5\\).\n   - Simplifying, \\((3\\#4)\\$5 = \\frac{14}{4} + 25 = \\frac{14}{4} + \\frac{100}{4} = \\frac{114}{4} = 28.5\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\%6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\#4)\\$5 = 28.5\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\%6 = \\frac{28.5 + 6}{6}\\).\n   - Simplifying, \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\%6 = \\frac{34.5}{6}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the final result using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 5 * b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate step by step\nresult_hash = operation_hash(3, 4)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(result_hash, 5)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_dollar, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_percent)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\%6\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\%6\\) as 5.75. \n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):** \n   - \\((3 + 4) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\):** \n   - \\(2 \\times 1.75 + 5 \\times 5 = 3.5 + 25 = 28.5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\%6\\):** \n   - \\((28.5 + 6) / 6 = 34.5 / 6 = 5.75\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\%6\\) is:\n\n<<<5.75>>>"
