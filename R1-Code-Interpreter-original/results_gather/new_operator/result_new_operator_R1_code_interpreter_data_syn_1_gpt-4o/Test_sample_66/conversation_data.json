    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)$5%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 4a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3@4 = 4 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 12 + 8 = 20\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\(20$5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a$b = 5a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 20\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     20$5 = 5 \\times 20 + 1 \\times 5 = 100 + 5 = 105\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(105%6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a%b = 4a + 4b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 105\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     105%6 = 4 \\times 105 + 4 \\times 6 = 420 + 24 = 444\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef at_operation(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 2 * b\n\ndef dollar_operation(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 1 * b\n\ndef percent_operation(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3@4)$5%6\nresult = percent_operation(dollar_operation(at_operation(3, 4), 5), 6)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3@4 = 20, 20$5 = 105, 105%6 = 444>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches the expected result. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3@4 = 20, 20$5 = 105, 105%6 = 444>>>"
