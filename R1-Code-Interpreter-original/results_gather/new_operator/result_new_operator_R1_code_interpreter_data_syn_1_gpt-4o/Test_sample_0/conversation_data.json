    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)&5\\):**\n   - We already know \\(3~4 = 12\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 5 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\((3~4)&5 = 5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 5 = 60 + 25 = 85\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(5@6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(5@6 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 90\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   - We need to evaluate \\((3~4)&5@6\\), which is equivalent to \\(85@90\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(85@90 = 3 \\times 85 \\times 90\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the final result using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\ndef operation_and(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 5 * b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\n# Calculate each step\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_and = operation_and(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_at = operation_at(5, 6)\n\n# Final calculation\nfinal_result = operation_at(result_and, result_at)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result for the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final result of the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\) is 22950. \n\nThe steps were as follows:\n- \\(3~4 = 12\\)\n- \\((3~4)&5 = 85\\)\n- \\(5@6 = 90\\)\n- Finally, \\(85@90 = 22950\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<22950>>>"
