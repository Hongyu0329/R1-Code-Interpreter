    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)#5&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the operation definition, \\(a~b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)#5\\):**\n   - We already calculated \\(3~4 = 24\\).\n   - According to the operation definition, \\(a#b = 4 \\times a + 3 \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(24#5 = 4 \\times 24 + 3 \\times 5 = 96 + 15 = 111\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3~4)#5&6\\):**\n   - We already calculated \\((3~4)#5 = 111\\).\n   - According to the operation definition, \\(a&b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(111&6 = \\frac{111 + 6}{6} = \\frac{117}{6} = 19.5\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm these calculations using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 3 * b\n\ndef operation_ampersand(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3~4)#5&6\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_hash = operation_hash(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_ampersand = operation_ampersand(result_hash, 6)\n\nprint(result_ampersand)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<19.5>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches the expected result. Therefore, the final answer to the expression \\((3~4)#5&6\\) is:\n\n<<<19.5>>>"
