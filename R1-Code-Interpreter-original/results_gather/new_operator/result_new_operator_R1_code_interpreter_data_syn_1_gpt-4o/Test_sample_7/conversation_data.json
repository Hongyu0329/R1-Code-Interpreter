    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = 2a + 5b \\). We are asked to calculate \\((2@4)@4\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2@4\\):**\n   - Using the definition, \\(2@4 = 2 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the result of the first operation with 4:**\n   - Let \\(x = 2@4\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(x@4\\) using the same operation definition.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 5 * b\n\n# Calculate 2@4\nfirst_result = operation(2, 4)\n\n# Calculate (2@4)@4\nfinal_result = operation(first_result, 4)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\((2@4)@4\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the operation \\((2@4)@4\\) is 68. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2@4\\):**\n   - \\(2@4 = 2 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 4 = 4 + 20 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((2@4)@4\\):**\n   - Now, substitute the result from the first calculation: \\(24@4 = 2 \\times 24 + 5 \\times 4 = 48 + 20 = 68\\).\n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n\n<<<68>>>"
