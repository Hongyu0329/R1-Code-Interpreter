    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol '@'. According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a@b \\) is defined as \\( 3 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nWe need to calculate \\((5@2)@9\\).\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 5@2 \\):\n   \\[\n   5@2 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 2\n   \\]\n\n2. Then, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((5@2)@9\\):\n   \\[\n   (5@2)@9 = 3 \\times (5@2) \\times 9\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 5@2\nresult_5_2 = 3 * 5 * 2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (5@2)@9\nresult_final = 3 * result_5_2 * 9\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_final)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\((5@2)@9\\).",
