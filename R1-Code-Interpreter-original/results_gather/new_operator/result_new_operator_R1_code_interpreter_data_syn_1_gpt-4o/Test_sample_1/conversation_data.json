    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\& b = 4 \\times a + 2 \\times b \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((5 \\& 3) \\& 6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\(5 \\& 3\\):\n   \\[\n   5 \\& 3 = 4 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 3\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((5 \\& 3) \\& 6\\):\n   \\[\n   (5 \\& 3) \\& 6 = 4 \\times (5 \\& 3) + 2 \\times 6\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a & b\ndef custom_and(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Calculate 5 & 3\nresult_5_and_3 = custom_and(5, 3)\n\n# Calculate (5 & 3) & 6\nfinal_result = custom_and(result_5_and_3, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression \\((5 \\& 3) \\& 6\\).",
