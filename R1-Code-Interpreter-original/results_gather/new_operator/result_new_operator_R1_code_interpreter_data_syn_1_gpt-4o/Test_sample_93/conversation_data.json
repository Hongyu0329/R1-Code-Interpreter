    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"@\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a@b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\((9@4)@3\\). This means we first calculate \\(9@4\\), and then use the result to calculate the next operation with 3.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(9@4\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   9@4 = \\frac{9 + 4}{4} = \\frac{13}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the result of \\(9@4\\) to calculate \\((9@4)@3\\):**\n\n   Let \\( x = 9@4 = \\frac{13}{4} \\).\n\n   Now calculate \\( x@3 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   x@3 = \\frac{x + 3}{3} = \\frac{\\frac{13}{4} + 3}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify the expression:\n\n   \\[\n   x@3 = \\frac{\\frac{13}{4} + \\frac{12}{4}}{3} = \\frac{\\frac{25}{4}}{3} = \\frac{25}{12}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a@b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate 9@4\nresult_9_4 = operation(9, 4)\n\n# Calculate (9@4)@3\nfinal_result = operation(result_9_4, 3)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the calculation. Let's proceed with the final answer.\n\n<<<9@4 = 13/4, (9@4)@3 = 25/12>>>",
    "The code output confirms the calculation. The result of \\((9@4)@3\\) is approximately 2.0833333333333335, which is equivalent to the fraction \\(\\frac{25}{12}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9@4 = 13/4, (9@4)@3 = 25/12>>>"
