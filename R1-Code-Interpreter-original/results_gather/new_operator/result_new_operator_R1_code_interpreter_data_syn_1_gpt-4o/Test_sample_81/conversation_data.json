    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a \\sim b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\((6 \\sim 1) \\sim 9\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 6 \\sim 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\sim 1 = \\frac{6 + 1}{1} = \\frac{7}{1} = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( 7 \\sim 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   7 \\sim 9 = \\frac{7 + 9}{9} = \\frac{16}{9}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a ~ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (6 ~ 1) ~ 9\nresult = operation(operation(6, 1), 9)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<(6~1)~9 = 16/9>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The operation \\( (6 \\sim 1) \\sim 9 \\) results in the value \\( \\frac{16}{9} \\), which is approximately 1.7777777777777777 when expressed as a decimal.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<(6~1)~9 = 16/9>>>"
