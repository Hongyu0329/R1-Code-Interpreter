    "To solve the expression \\((3\\$4)@5\\%6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\$4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 3a + 5b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - \\(3\\$4 = 3*3 + 5*4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the result of the first operation and use it in the next operation \\((result)@5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 5a + 4b\\).\n   - Substitute the result from step 1 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - \\((3\\$4)@5 = 5*(3\\$4) + 4*5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the result of the second operation and use it in the final operation \\((result)\\%6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = 4ab\\).\n   - Substitute the result from step 2 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - \\((3\\$4)@5\\%6 = 4*((3\\$4)@5)*6\\).\n\nLet's compute these step by step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3$4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = 3 * a + 5 * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3$4)@5\na = result_1\nb = 5\nresult_2 = 5 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Step 3: Calculate (3$4)@5%6\na = result_2\nb = 6\nresult_3 = 4 * a * b\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the results of each step.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the results for each step of the calculation.
