    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\# b = 3 \\times a \\times b \\). We are asked to calculate \\( (9 \\# 7) \\# 2 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 9 \\# 7 \\):**\n   - Using the definition, \\( 9 \\# 7 = 3 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the result of the first operation with 2:**\n   - Let the result of \\( 9 \\# 7 \\) be \\( x \\).\n   - Then, calculate \\( x \\# 2 = 3 \\times x \\times 2 \\).\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 9#7\na = 9\nb = 7\nresult_9_7 = 3 * a * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (9#7)#2\nc = 2\nfinal_result = 3 * result_9_7 * c\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\( (9 \\# 7) \\# 2 \\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 1134. This means that the calculation for \\( (9 \\# 7) \\# 2 \\) is correct.\n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. Calculate \\( 9 \\# 7 \\):\n   - \\( 9 \\# 7 = 3 \\times 9 \\times 7 = 189 \\).\n\n2. Calculate \\( 189 \\# 2 \\):\n   - \\( 189 \\# 2 = 3 \\times 189 \\times 2 = 1134 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final result of \\( (9 \\# 7) \\# 2 \\) is 1134.\n\n<<<1134>>>"
