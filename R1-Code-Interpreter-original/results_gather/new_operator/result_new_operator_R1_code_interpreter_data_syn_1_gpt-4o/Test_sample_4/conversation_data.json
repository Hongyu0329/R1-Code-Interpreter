    "To solve the expression \\((3\\%4)\\#5\\&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\%4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = 4 \\times a + 2 \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3\\%4 = 4 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 12 + 8 = 20\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\%4)\\#5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\%4 = 20\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 20\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     (3\\%4)\\#5 = \\frac{20 + 5}{5} = \\frac{25}{5} = 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(((3\\%4)\\#5)\\&6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\%4)\\#5 = 5\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     ((3\\%4)\\#5)\\&6 = \\frac{5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{11}{6}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 2 * b\n\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_ampersand(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3%4)#5&6\nresult_percent = operation_percent(3, 4)\nresult_hash = operation_hash(result_percent, 5)\nresult_ampersand = operation_ampersand(result_hash, 6)\n\nprint(result_percent, result_hash, result_ampersand)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the calculations.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculations.
