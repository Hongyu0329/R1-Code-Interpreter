    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\& b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\( (1 \\& 3) \\& 3 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 1 \\& 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   1 \\& 3 = \\frac{1 + 3}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (1 \\& 3) \\& 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   (1 \\& 3) \\& 3 = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\& 3 = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} + 3}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{3} + 3 = \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{9}{3} = \\frac{13}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   So,\n   \\[\n   (1 \\& 3) \\& 3 = \\frac{\\frac{13}{3}}{3} = \\frac{13}{9}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a & b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (1 & 3) & 3\nresult = operation(operation(1, 3), 3)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is approximately \\(1.4444\\), which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{13}{9}\\) when expressed as a fraction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(1&3)&3 = 13/9>>>"
