    "To solve the expression \\((3\\%4)\\#5\\sim6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the custom operations as defined:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\%4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\%4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\%4)\\#5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 5 \\times a + 1 \\times b\\).\n   - We already calculated \\(3\\%4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - So, \\((3\\%4)\\#5 = 5 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 1 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(((3\\%4)\\#5)\\sim6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - We need to calculate \\((3\\%4)\\#5\\) first, then use that result to calculate the final operation.\n\nLet's compute these step-by-step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3%4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = (a + b) / b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3%4)#5\nc = 5\nresult_2 = 5 * result_1 + 1 * c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3%4)#5)~6\nd = 6\nresult_3 = 3 * result_2 * d\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final result of the expression \\((3\\%4)\\#5\\sim6\\) is 247.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<3%4#5~6 = 247.5>>>"
