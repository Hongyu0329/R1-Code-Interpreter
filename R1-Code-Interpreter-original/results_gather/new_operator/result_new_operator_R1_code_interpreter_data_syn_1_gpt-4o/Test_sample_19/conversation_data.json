    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = 2 \\times a + 2 \\times b \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((9@4)@4\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\(9@4\\):\n   \\[\n   9@4 = 2 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((9@4)@4\\):\n   \\[\n   (9@4)@4 = 2 \\times (9@4) + 2 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Calculate 9@4\nresult_9_4 = operation(9, 4)\n\n# Calculate (9@4)@4\nfinal_result = operation(result_9_4, 4)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((9@4)@4\\) is 60. \n\nThe steps were as follows:\n1. Calculate \\(9@4 = 2 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 4 = 18 + 8 = 26\\).\n2. Then, calculate \\((9@4)@4 = 2 \\times 26 + 2 \\times 4 = 52 + 8 = 60\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<60>>>"
