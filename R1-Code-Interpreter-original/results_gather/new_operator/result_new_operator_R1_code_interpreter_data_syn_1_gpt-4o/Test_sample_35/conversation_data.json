    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as a#b = 3*a + 5*b. We are asked to calculate (3#2)#5.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate 3#2 using the definition:\n   - a = 3, b = 2\n   - 3#2 = 3*3 + 5*2\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate the next operation with 5:\n   - Let the result of 3#2 be x.\n   - Then, x#5 = 3*x + 5*5\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a#b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 3*a + 5*b\n\n# Calculate 3#2\nresult_3_2 = operation(3, 2)\n\n# Calculate (3#2)#5\nfinal_result = operation(result_3_2, 5)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the operation (3#2)#5.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the operation (3#2)#5 is 82. \n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final answer:\n\n1. Calculate 3#2:\n   - 3#2 = 3*3 + 5*2 = 9 + 10 = 19\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate (3#2)#5:\n   - 19#5 = 3*19 + 5*5 = 57 + 25 = 82\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<82>>>"
