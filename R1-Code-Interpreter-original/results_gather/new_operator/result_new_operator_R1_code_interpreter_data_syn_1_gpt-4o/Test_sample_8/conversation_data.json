    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\#6\\) using the given operations:\n\n1. **Operation %**: For any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a\\%b\\) is defined as \\(3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n2. **Operation $**: For any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a\\$b\\) is defined as \\(5 \\times a + 4 \\times b\\).\n3. **Operation #**: For any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a\\#b\\) is defined as \\(2 \\times a + 2 \\times b\\).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\%4\\):**\n   \\[\n   3\\%4 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\):**\n   \\[\n   36\\$5 = 5 \\times 36 + 4 \\times 5 = 180 + 20 = 200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(((3\\%4)\\$5)\\#6\\):**\n   \\[\n   200\\#6 = 2 \\times 200 + 2 \\times 6 = 400 + 12 = 412\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 4 * b\n\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3%4)$5#6\nresult_percent = operation_percent(3, 4)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(result_percent, 5)\nresult_hash = operation_hash(result_dollar, 6)\n\nprint(result_hash)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed the calculations. Therefore, the final result of the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\#6\\) is:\n\n<<<36%4$5#6>>>"
