    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the custom operations \\(\\#\\), \\(\\&\\), and \\(@\\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\#4 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\):**\n   - We already know \\(3\\#4 = 24\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(24\\&5 = 3 \\times 24 \\times 5 = 360\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6\\):**\n   - We already know \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 360\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 4 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(360@6 = 4 \\times 360 \\times 6\\).\n\nLet's calculate the final step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\ndef operation_and(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return 4 * a * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3#4)&5@6\nresult_hash = operation_hash(3, 4)\nresult_and = operation_and(result_hash, 5)\nresult_at = operation_at(result_and, 6)\n\nprint(result_at)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result for the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6\\) is 8640. \n\nThe steps were as follows:\n- \\(3\\#4 = 24\\)\n- \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 360\\)\n- \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6 = 8640\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8640>>>"
