    "To solve the expression \\((3 \\sim 4) \\, \\$ \\, 5 \\, \\# \\, 6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3 \\sim 4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a \\sim b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3 \\sim 4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3 \\sim 4) \\, \\$ \\, 5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a \\, \\$ \\, b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - We have already calculated \\(3 \\sim 4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - So, \\((3 \\sim 4) \\, \\$ \\, 5 = 3 \\times \\frac{7}{4} \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the result of \\((3 \\sim 4) \\, \\$ \\, 5\\) and then apply \\(\\# 6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a \\# b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - We need to calculate the result of \\((3 \\sim 4) \\, \\$ \\, 5\\) first, and then use it in the operation with 6.\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3 ~ 4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = (a + b) / b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3 ~ 4) $ 5\nc = 5\nresult_2 = 3 * result_1 * c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3 ~ 4) $ 5) # 6\nd = 6\nfinal_result = (result_2 + d) / d\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the final result.",
