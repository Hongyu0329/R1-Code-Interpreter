    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as \\( 3a + 2b \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\( (10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2 \\).\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 10 \\sim 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\sim 2 = 3 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 2\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   (10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2 = 3 \\times (10 \\sim 2) + 2 \\times 2\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a ~ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Calculate 10 ~ 2\nfirst_result = operation(10, 2)\n\n# Calculate (10 ~ 2) ~ 2\nfinal_result = operation(first_result, 2)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression \\( (10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2 \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output of 106. This means that the calculation for \\( (10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2 \\) is correct.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate \\( 10 \\sim 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\sim 2 = 3 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 2 = 30 + 4 = 34\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   34 \\sim 2 = 3 \\times 34 + 2 \\times 2 = 102 + 4 = 106\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\( (10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2 \\) is 106.\n\n<<<106>>>"
