    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\# b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\( (3 \\# 2) \\# 6 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 3 \\# 2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\# 2 = \\frac{3 + 2}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( 2.5 \\# 6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\# 6 = \\frac{2.5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{8.5}{6}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the final result using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a#b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (3#2)#6\nresult = operation(operation(3, 2), 6)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final result for \\( (3 \\# 2) \\# 6 \\).",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result of the operation \\( (3 \\# 2) \\# 6 \\).\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n1. Calculate \\( 3 \\# 2 = 2.5 \\).\n2. Use the result to calculate \\( 2.5 \\# 6 = \\frac{8.5}{6} \\approx 1.4166666666666667 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.4166666666666667>>>"
