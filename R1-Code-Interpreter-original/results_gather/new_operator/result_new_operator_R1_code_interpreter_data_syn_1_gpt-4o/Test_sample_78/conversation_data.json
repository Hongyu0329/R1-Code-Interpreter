    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\) using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Operation ~**: For any numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a~b\\) is defined as \\(3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n2. **Operation $**: For any numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a\\$b\\) is defined as \\(3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n3. **Operation @**: For any numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a@b\\) is defined as \\((a + b) / b\\).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3~4\\):**\n   \\[\n   3~4 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3~4)\\$5\\):**\n   \\[\n   36\\$5 = 3 \\times 36 \\times 5 = 540\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\):**\n   \\[\n   540@6 = \\frac{540 + 6}{6} = \\frac{546}{6} = 91\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to verify the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3~4)$5@6\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_at = operation_at(result_dollar, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_at)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\(91.0\\), which confirms our manual calculations.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(3~4)$5@6 = 91>>>"
