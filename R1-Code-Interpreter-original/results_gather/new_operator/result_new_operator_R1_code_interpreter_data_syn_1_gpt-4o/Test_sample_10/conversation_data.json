    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)#5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)#5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3~4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = 5a + 5b\\).\n   - So, \\((3~4)#5 = 5 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 5 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3~4)#5@6\\):**\n   - We need to calculate \\((3~4)#5\\) first, then use the result to evaluate the final expression.\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\((3~4)#5@6 = ((3~4)#5) \\times 6\\).\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3~4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_3_tilde_4 = (a + b) / b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3~4)#5\nc = 5\nresult_3_tilde_4_hash_5 = 5 * result_3_tilde_4 + 5 * c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate (3~4)#5@6\nd = 6\nresult_final = result_3_tilde_4_hash_5 * d\n\nprint(result_3_tilde_4, result_3_tilde_4_hash_5, result_final)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the results.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have the results for each step of the calculation:\n\n1. \\(3~4 = 1.75\\)\n2. \\((3~4)#5 = 33.75\\)\n3. \\((3~4)#5@6 = 202.5\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.75, 33.75, 202.5>>>"
