    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = 4a + 3b \\). We are asked to calculate \\((2@2)@3\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 2@2 \\):\n   \\[\n   2@2 = 4 \\times 2 + 3 \\times 2 = 8 + 6 = 14\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((2@2)@3\\), which is \\( 14@3 \\):\n   \\[\n   14@3 = 4 \\times 14 + 3 \\times 3 = 56 + 9 = 65\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\((2@2)@3\\) is 65.\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 3 * b\n\nresult = operation(operation(2, 2), 3)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the calculation.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of \\((2@2)@3\\) is indeed 65.\n\n<<<2@2=14, 14@3=65>>>"
