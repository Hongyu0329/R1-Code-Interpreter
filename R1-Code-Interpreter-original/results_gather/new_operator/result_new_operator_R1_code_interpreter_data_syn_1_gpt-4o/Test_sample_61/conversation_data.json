    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as \\( 3 \\times a + 3 \\times b \\).\n\nWe need to calculate \\( (9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9 \\).\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 9 \\sim 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   9 \\sim 4 = 3 \\times 9 + 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   (9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9 = 3 \\times (9 \\sim 4) + 3 \\times 9\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a ~ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 3 * b\n\n# Calculate 9 ~ 4\nresult_9_4 = operation(9, 4)\n\n# Calculate (9 ~ 4) ~ 9\nfinal_result = operation(result_9_4, 9)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression \\( (9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9 \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of the expression \\((9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9\\) as 144. \n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1. Calculate \\(9 \\sim 4\\):\n   \\[\n   9 \\sim 4 = 3 \\times 9 + 3 \\times 4 = 27 + 12 = 39\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9\\):\n   \\[\n   (9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9 = 3 \\times 39 + 3 \\times 9 = 117 + 27 = 144\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result is 144.\n\n<<<144>>>"
