    "To solve the expression \\((3&4)#5~6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the custom operations defined:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3&4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 4 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3&4 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the result of the above with #5:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Use the result from step 1 as \\(a\\) and 5 as \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the result of the above with ~6:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 4 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n   - Use the result from step 2 as \\(a\\) and 6 as \\(b\\).\n\nLet's compute these step-by-step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3&4\nresult_1 = 4 * 3 * 4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (result_1)#5\nresult_2 = 2 * result_1 * 5\n\n# Step 3: Calculate (result_2)~6\nresult_3 = 4 * result_2 + 5 * 6\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
