    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\((3\\%4)~5\\#6\\) using the custom operations defined:\n\n1. **Operation %**: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a\\%b\\) is defined as \\((a + b)/b\\).\n2. **Operation ~**: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a~b\\) is defined as \\(1*a + 1*b\\).\n3. **Operation #**: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a\\#b\\) is defined as \\(4*a + 2*b\\).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\%4\\):**\n   \\[\n   3\\%4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\%4)~5\\):**\n   \\[\n   1.75~5 = 1*1.75 + 1*5 = 1.75 + 5 = 6.75\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\%4)~5\\#6\\):**\n   \\[\n   6.75\\#6 = 4*6.75 + 2*6 = 27 + 12 = 39\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the custom operations\ndef custom_mod(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef custom_tilde(a, b):\n    return 1 * a + 1 * b\n\ndef custom_hash(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3%4)~5#6\nresult = custom_hash(custom_tilde(custom_mod(3, 4), 5), 6)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<39>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `39.0`, which confirms our manual calculations. The result is a floating-point number due to the division operation in the custom `%` operation, but it represents the integer value `39`.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<39>>>"
