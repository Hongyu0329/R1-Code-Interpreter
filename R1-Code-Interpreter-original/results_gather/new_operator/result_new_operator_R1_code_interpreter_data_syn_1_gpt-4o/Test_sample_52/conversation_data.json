    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)%5&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 5a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3@4 = 5 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 15 + 8 = 23\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3@4)%5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3@4 = 23\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a%b = 4a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 23\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     23%5 = 4 \\times 23 + 1 \\times 5 = 92 + 5 = 97\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(((3@4)%5)&6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3@4)%5 = 97\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 97\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     97&6 = \\frac{97 + 6}{6} = \\frac{103}{6}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the final result using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 2 * b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 1 * b\n\ndef operation_and(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3@4)%5&6\nresult_at = operation_at(3, 4)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_at, 5)\nresult_and = operation_and(result_percent, 6)\n\nprint(result_and)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the final result for the expression \\((3@4)%5&6\\).\n\n<<<17.166666666666668>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is \\(17.166666666666668\\). This confirms that the calculations were performed correctly according to the defined operations.\n\nThe final result of the expression \\((3@4)%5&6\\) is:\n\n<<<17.166666666666668>>>"
