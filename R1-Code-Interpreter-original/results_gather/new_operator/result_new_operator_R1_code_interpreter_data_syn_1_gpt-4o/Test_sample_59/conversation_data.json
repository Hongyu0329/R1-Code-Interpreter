    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the custom operation defined as \\( a \\% b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((4\\%3)\\%8\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(4 \\% 3\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(4 \\% 3 = \\frac{4 + 3}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((4 \\% 3) \\% 8\\):**\n   - First, we need the result from step 1, which is \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\).\n   - Now, apply the custom operation again: \\(\\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) \\% 8 = \\frac{\\frac{7}{3} + 8}{8}\\).\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 4 % 3\nresult_1 = (4 + 3) / 3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (4 % 3) % 8\nresult_2 = (result_1 + 8) / 8\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_2)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression \\((4\\%3)\\%8\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the result for the expression \\((4\\%3)\\%8\\) as approximately 1.2916666666666667. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(4 \\% 3\\):**\n   - \\(4 \\% 3 = \\frac{4 + 3}{3} = \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.3333\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((4 \\% 3) \\% 8\\):**\n   - \\(\\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) \\% 8 = \\frac{\\frac{7}{3} + 8}{8} = \\frac{2.3333 + 8}{8} = \\frac{10.3333}{8} \\approx 1.2917\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((4\\%3)\\%8\\) is approximately 1.2917.\n\n<<<1.2917>>>"
