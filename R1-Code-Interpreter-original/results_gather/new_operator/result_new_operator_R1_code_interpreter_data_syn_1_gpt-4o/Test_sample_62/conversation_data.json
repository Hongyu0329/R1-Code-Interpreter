    "To solve the expression \\((3\\$4)@5&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\$4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 3a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3*3 + 2*4\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the result of \\(3\\$4\\) with \\(5\\) using the @ operation:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 2ab\\).\n   - Use the result from step 1 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - Calculate \\(2 * (\\text{result from step 1}) * 5\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the result of the previous operation with \\(6\\) using the & operation:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 3a + 4b\\).\n   - Use the result from step 2 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3 * (\\text{result from step 2}) + 4 * 6\\).\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3$4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = 3 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3$4)@5\na = result_1\nb = 5\nresult_2 = 2 * a * b\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3$4)@5)&6\na = result_2\nb = 6\nresult_3 = 3 * a + 4 * b\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
