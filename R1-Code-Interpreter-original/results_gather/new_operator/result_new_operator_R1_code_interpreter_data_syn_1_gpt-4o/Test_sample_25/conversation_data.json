    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol '@'. According to the problem, a@b is defined as 1 * a * b. This means that the operation '@' is essentially a multiplication of the two numbers a and b, with an additional factor of 1, which does not change the result.\n\nGiven the expression (6@9)@4, we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate 6@9:\n   - According to the definition, 6@9 = 1 * 6 * 9 = 54.\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate (6@9)@4:\n   - Substitute the result from step 1: 54@4 = 1 * 54 * 4.\n\nNow, let's compute the final result using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a@b\ndef at_operation(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\n# Calculate (6@9)@4\nresult = at_operation(at_operation(6, 9), 4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression (6@9)@4.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 216. This means that the expression (6@9)@4 evaluates to 216.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. Calculate 6@9:\n   - 6@9 = 1 * 6 * 9 = 54\n\n2. Calculate (6@9)@4:\n   - 54@4 = 1 * 54 * 4 = 216\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression (6@9)@4 is 216.\n\n<<<216>>>"
