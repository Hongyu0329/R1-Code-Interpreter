    "To solve the expression \\((3\\$4)\\#5\\sim6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the custom operations as defined:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\$4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 2a + 5b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3\\$4 = 2 \\times 3 + 5 \\times 4\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the result of the above with \\#5:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 5ab\\).\n   - Substitute the result from step 1 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     (3\\$4)\\#5 = 5 \\times (3\\$4) \\times 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the result of the above with \\sim6:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute the result from step 2 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     ((3\\$4)\\#5)\\sim6 = \\frac{((3\\$4)\\#5) + 6}{6}\n     \\]\n\nLet's compute these step-by-step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3$4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = 2 * a + 5 * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3$4)#5\nb = 5\nresult_2 = 5 * result_1 * b\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3$4)#5)~6\nb = 6\nresult_3 = (result_2 + b) / b\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
