    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)#5&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 4a + 5b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3~4 = 4 \\times 3 + 5 \\times 4 = 12 + 20 = 32\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)#5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3~4 = 32\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 32\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     (3~4)#5 = \\frac{32 + 5}{5} = \\frac{37}{5} = 7.4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(((3~4)#5)&6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3~4)#5 = 7.4\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 7.4\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     ((3~4)#5)&6 = 1 \\times 7.4 \\times 6 = 44.4\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 5 * b\n\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_ampersand(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3~4)#5&6\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_hash = operation_hash(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_ampersand = operation_ampersand(result_hash, 6)\n\nprint(result_ampersand)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final result. Let's proceed with the execution.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculations. The result of the expression \\((3~4)#5&6\\) is approximately 44.4. The slight difference in the decimal places is due to floating-point precision in Python.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<44.4>>>"
