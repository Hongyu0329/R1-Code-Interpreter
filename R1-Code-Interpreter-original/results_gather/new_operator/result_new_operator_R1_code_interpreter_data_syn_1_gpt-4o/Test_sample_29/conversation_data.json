    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\$ b = 1 \\times a + 1 \\times b \\). This operation is essentially the same as the addition of two numbers, \\( a + b \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((1 \\$ 8) \\$ 10\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 1 \\$ 8 \\).\n2. Then, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((1 \\$ 8) \\$ 10\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. \\( 1 \\$ 8 = 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 8 = 1 + 8 = 9 \\).\n2. Now, calculate \\( 9 \\$ 10 = 1 \\times 9 + 1 \\times 10 = 9 + 10 = 19 \\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((1 \\$ 8) \\$ 10\\) is 19.\n\n<<<19>>>"
