    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"$\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\$ b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a \\$ b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\( (3 \\$ 10) \\$ 7 \\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 3 \\$ 10 \\):**\n\n   Using the definition:\n   \\[\n   3 \\$ 10 = \\frac{3 + 10}{10} = \\frac{13}{10} = 1.3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( (3 \\$ 10) \\$ 7 \\):**\n\n   Now, substitute the result from the first calculation:\n   \\[\n   1.3 \\$ 7 = \\frac{1.3 + 7}{7} = \\frac{8.3}{7}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute the final result using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation\ndef dollar_operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (3$10)$7\nresult = dollar_operation(dollar_operation(3, 10), 7)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final result for \\( (3 \\$ 10) \\$ 7 \\).",
