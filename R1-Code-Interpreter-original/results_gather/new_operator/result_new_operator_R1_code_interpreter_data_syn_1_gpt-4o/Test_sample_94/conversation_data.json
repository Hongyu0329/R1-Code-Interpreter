    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\$6\\), we need to break it down step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 1 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - \\(3\\#4 = 1 \\times 3 + 5 \\times 4 = 3 + 20 = 23\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(5\\$6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - \\(5\\$6 = 1 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\$6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = 23\\) and \\(5\\$6 = 30\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 5 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 23\\) and \\(b = 30\\).\n   - \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\$6 = 5 \\times 23 \\times 30\\).\n\nNow, let's compute the final result using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 1 * a + 5 * b\n\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 5 * a * b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\n# Calculate each part\nresult_hash = operation_hash(3, 4)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(5, 6)\nfinal_result = operation_tilde(result_hash, result_dollar)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\$6\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 3450. This means that the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\$6\\) evaluates to 3450.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23, ~, 30>>>"
