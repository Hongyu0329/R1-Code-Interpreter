    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\& b = 2 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\( (4 \\& 4) \\& 4 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 4 \\& 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   4 \\& 4 = 2 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 32\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( 32 \\& 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   32 \\& 4 = 2 \\times 32 \\times 4 = 256\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\( (4 \\& 4) \\& 4 \\) is 256.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef custom_and(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\n# Calculate (4&4)&4\nresult = custom_and(custom_and(4, 4), 4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result. Let's proceed with the execution.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed our manual calculation. The result of \\((4 \\& 4) \\& 4\\) is indeed 256.\n\n<<<256>>>"
