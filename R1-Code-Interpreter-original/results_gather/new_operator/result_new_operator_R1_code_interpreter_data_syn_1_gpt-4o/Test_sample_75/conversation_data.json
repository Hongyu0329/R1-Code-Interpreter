    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = 2a + 4b \\). We are asked to calculate \\((1@4)@2\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(1@4\\):**\n   - Using the definition, \\(1@4 = 2 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 4\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(2 + 16 = 18\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(18@2\\):**\n   - Now, we use the result from the first step and apply the operation again.\n   - \\(18@2 = 2 \\times 18 + 4 \\times 2\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(36 + 8 = 44\\).\n\nThus, the final result of \\((1@4)@2\\) is 44.\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Calculate 1@4\nresult1 = operation(1, 4)\n\n# Calculate (1@4)@2\nfinal_result = operation(result1, 2)\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we should get the final result. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output confirms our manual calculation. Therefore, the final result of \\((1@4)@2\\) is 44.\n\n<<<44>>>"
