    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a \\sim b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\((1 \\sim 5) \\sim 3\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 1 \\sim 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 \\sim 5 = \\frac{1 + 5}{5} = \\frac{6}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((1 \\sim 5) \\sim 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) \\sim 3 = \\frac{\\frac{6}{5} + 3}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the expression inside the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{5} + 3 = \\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{15}{5} = \\frac{21}{5}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculate the final expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{21}{5}}{3} = \\frac{21}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{21}{15} = \\frac{7}{5}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\((1 \\sim 5) \\sim 3\\) is \\(\\frac{7}{5}\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a ~ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (1 ~ 5) ~ 3\nresult = operation(operation(1, 5), 3)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<1~5 = 6/5, (1~5)~3 = 7/5>>>",
    "The code output of `1.4000000000000001` is a result of floating-point arithmetic precision in Python. This is equivalent to the fraction \\(\\frac{7}{5}\\), which is \\(1.4\\) in decimal form. \n\nThe calculation steps were correct, and the code verified the result. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1~5 = 6/5, (1~5)~3 = 7/5>>>"
