    "To solve the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\sim6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the given operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\%4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\%4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\):**\n   - We already calculated \\(3\\%4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\((3\\%4)\\$5 = \\frac{\\frac{7}{4} + 5}{5}\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\sim6\\):**\n   - We need to calculate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\) first.\n   - Then, use the result to evaluate the final operation with \\(\\sim\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 1 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n\nLet's compute these step by step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3%4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = (a + b) / b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3%4)$5\nc = 5\nresult_2 = (result_1 + c) / c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate (3%4)$5~6\nd = 6\nresult_3 = 1 * result_2 + 5 * d\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the values of each step and the final result.",
    "Now that we have the results from the code execution, let's interpret them:\n\n1. **\\(3\\%4\\):** The result is \\(1.75\\).\n2. **\\((3\\%4)\\$5\\):** The result is \\(1.35\\).\n3. **\\((3\\%4)\\$5\\sim6\\):** The final result is \\(31.35\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\sim6\\) is:\n\n<<<1.75, 1.35, 31.35>>>"
