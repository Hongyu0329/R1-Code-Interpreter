    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol '@'. According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a@b \\) is defined as \\( 2 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nWe need to calculate \\((2@10)@5\\).\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 2@10 \\):\n   \\[\n   2@10 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 10 = 40\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from the first step to calculate \\((2@10)@5\\), which is equivalent to \\( 40@5 \\):\n   \\[\n   40@5 = 2 \\times 40 \\times 5 = 400\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a@b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\n# Calculate (2@10)@5\nresult = operation(operation(2, 10), 5)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<400>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches our manual calculation. Therefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<400>>>"
