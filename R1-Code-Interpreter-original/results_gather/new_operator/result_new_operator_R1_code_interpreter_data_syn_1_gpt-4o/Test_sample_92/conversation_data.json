    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)%5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 5a + 4b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3~4 = 5 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the result of \\(3~4\\) with %5:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = 2ab\\).\n   - Use the result from step 1 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - Calculate the result of \\((3~4)\\%5\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the result of \\((3~4)\\%5\\) with @6:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 4a + 4b\\).\n   - Use the result from step 2 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - Calculate the final result of \\((3~4)\\%5@6\\).\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3~4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = 5 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3~4)%5\nb = 5\nresult_2 = 2 * result_1 * b\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3~4)%5)@6\nb = 6\nresult_3 = 4 * result_2 + 4 * b\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the values for each step.",
    "The code execution has provided the results for each step of the calculation. Let's break down the results:\n\n1. **\\(3~4\\):** The result is 31.\n   - Calculation: \\(5 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 4 = 15 + 16 = 31\\).\n\n2. **\\((3~4)\\%5\\):** The result is 310.\n   - Calculation: \\(2 \\times 31 \\times 5 = 310\\).\n\n3. **\\(((3~4)\\%5)@6\\):** The result is 1264.\n   - Calculation: \\(4 \\times 310 + 4 \\times 6 = 1240 + 24 = 1264\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3~4)\\%5@6\\) is 1264.\n\n<<<31, 310, 1264>>>"
