    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\((3 \\# 4) @ 5 \\sim 6\\) using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3 \\# 4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a \\# b = 4a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3 \\# 4 = 4 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 12 + 4 = 16\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3 \\# 4) @ 5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3 \\# 4 = 16\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a @ b = 2ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 16\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     16 @ 5 = 2 \\times 16 \\times 5 = 160\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3 \\# 4) @ 5 \\sim 6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3 \\# 4) @ 5 = 160\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a \\sim b = 3a + 3b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 160\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     160 \\sim 6 = 3 \\times 160 + 3 \\times 6 = 480 + 18 = 498\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 1 * b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 3 * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3#4)@5~6\nresult_hash = operation_hash(3, 4)\nresult_at = operation_at(result_hash, 5)\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(result_at, 6)\n\nprint(result_hash, result_at, result_tilde)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the results for each step. Let's proceed to the final answer.\n\n<<<16 @ 5 ~ 6 = 498>>>",
