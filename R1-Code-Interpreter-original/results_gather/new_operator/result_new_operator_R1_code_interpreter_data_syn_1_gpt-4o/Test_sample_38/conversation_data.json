    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 2a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3\\#4 = 2 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = 10\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 1a + 3b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 10\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     10\\sim5 = 1 \\times 10 + 3 \\times 5 = 10 + 15 = 25\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\%6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\#4)\\sim5 = 25\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = 5ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 25\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     25\\%6 = 5 \\times 25 \\times 6\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the final result using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 1 * b\n\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 1 * a + 3 * b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return 5 * a * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3#4)~5%6\nresult_hash = operation_hash(3, 4)\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(result_hash, 5)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_tilde, 6)\n\nprint(result_percent)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
