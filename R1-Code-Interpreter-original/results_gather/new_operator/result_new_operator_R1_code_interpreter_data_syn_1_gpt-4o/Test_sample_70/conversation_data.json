    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\&6\\), we need to break it down step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\#4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(5\\&6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(5\\&6 = 1 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\&6\\):**\n   - First, we need to calculate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 3 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\((3\\#4)\\sim5 = 3 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 5 \\times 5\\).\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 5 * b\n\ndef operation_ampersand(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\n# Calculate each part\nresult_hash = operation_hash(3, 4)\nresult_ampersand = operation_ampersand(5, 6)\nfinal_result = operation_tilde(result_hash, 5)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\&6\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\&6\\) as 30.25. Let's break down the steps to ensure everything is clear:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - \\(3\\#4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(5\\&6\\):**\n   - \\(5\\&6 = 1 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\):**\n   - \\((3\\#4)\\sim5 = 3 \\times 1.75 + 5 \\times 5 = 5.25 + 25 = 30.25\\).\n\nThe final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\&6\\) is 30.25.\n\n<<<30.25>>>"
