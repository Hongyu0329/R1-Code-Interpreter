    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\& b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((3 \\& 5) \\& 2\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3 \\& 5\\):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\& 5 = \\frac{3 + 5}{5} = \\frac{8}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((3 \\& 5) \\& 2\\):**\n   \\[\n   (3 \\& 5) \\& 2 = \\left(\\frac{8}{5}\\right) \\& 2 = \\frac{\\frac{8}{5} + 2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{5} + 2 = \\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{10}{5} = \\frac{18}{5}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{8}{5}\\right) \\& 2 = \\frac{\\frac{18}{5}}{2} = \\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{9}{5}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a & b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (3 & 5) & 2\nresult = operation(operation(3, 5), 2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
