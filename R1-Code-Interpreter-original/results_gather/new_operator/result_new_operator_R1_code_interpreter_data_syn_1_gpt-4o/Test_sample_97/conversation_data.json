    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"$\". According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\$ b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a \\$ b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\( (3 \\$ 4) \\$ 10 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 3 \\$ 4 \\):**\n\n   Using the definition:\n   \\[\n   3 \\$ 4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( (3 \\$ 4) \\$ 10 \\):**\n\n   Now, substitute the result from step 1 into the next operation:\n   \\[\n   (3 \\$ 4) \\$ 10 = \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right) \\$ 10 = \\frac{\\frac{7}{4} + 10}{10}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{4} + 10 = \\frac{7}{4} + \\frac{40}{4} = \\frac{47}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, divide by 10:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{47}{4}}{10} = \\frac{47}{4 \\times 10} = \\frac{47}{40}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a $ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (3 $ 4) $ 10\nresult = operation(operation(3, 4), 10)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the calculation.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the operation \\((3 \\$ 4) \\$ 10\\) is indeed \\(1.175\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3$4 = 7/4, (3$4)$10 = 47/40 = 1.175>>>"
