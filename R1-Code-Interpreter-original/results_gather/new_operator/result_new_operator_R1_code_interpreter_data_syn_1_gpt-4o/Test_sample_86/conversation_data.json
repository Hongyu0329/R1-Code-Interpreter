    "To solve the expression \\((3&4)@5#6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the custom operations defined:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3&4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 5a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - \\(3&4 = 5*3 + 2*4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3&4)@5\\):**\n   - First, find the result of \\(3&4\\) from step 1.\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 3ab\\).\n   - Substitute the result of \\(3&4\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - \\((3&4)@5 = 3*(3&4)*5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(((3&4)@5)#6\\):**\n   - First, find the result of \\((3&4)@5\\) from step 2.\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute the result of \\((3&4)@5\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - \\(((3&4)@5)#6 = \\frac{((3&4)@5) + 6}{6}\\).\n\nLet's compute these step-by-step using Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3&4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_3_and_4 = 5 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3&4)@5\nb = 5\nresult_3_and_4_at_5 = 3 * result_3_and_4 * b\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3&4)@5)#6\nb = 6\nfinal_result = (result_3_and_4_at_5 + b) / b\n\nprint(result_3_and_4, result_3_and_4_at_5, final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
