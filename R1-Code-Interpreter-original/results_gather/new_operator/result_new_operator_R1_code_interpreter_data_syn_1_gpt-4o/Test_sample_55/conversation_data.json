    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the custom operation defined as a%b = 4*a + 4*b. This is not the typical modulus operation but a custom one.\n\nWe need to calculate (2%8)%5 using this custom operation.\n\n1. First, calculate 2%8 using the custom operation:\n   - According to the definition, 2%8 = 4*2 + 4*8.\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate the next operation with 5:\n   - Let the result from step 1 be x. Then, calculate x%5 using the custom operation:\n   - x%5 = 4*x + 4*5.\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 2%8\na = 2\nb = 8\nresult_1 = 4*a + 4*b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate result_1%5\nc = 5\nresult_2 = 4*result_1 + 4*c\n\nprint(result_2)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 180. This means that the result of the custom operation (2%8)%5 is 180.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<180>>>"
