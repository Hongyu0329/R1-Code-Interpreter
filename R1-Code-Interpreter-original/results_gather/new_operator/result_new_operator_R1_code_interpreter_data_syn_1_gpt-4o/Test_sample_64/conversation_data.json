    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)@5&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 1 \\times a + 4 \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3\\#4 = 1 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 4 = 3 + 16 = 19\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)@5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = 19\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 19\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - Calculate \\((3\\#4)@5 = \\frac{19 + 5}{5} = \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(((3\\#4)@5)&6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\#4)@5 = 4.8\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 4.8\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(((3\\#4)@5)&6 = \\frac{4.8 + 6}{6} = \\frac{10.8}{6} = 1.8\\).\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 1 * a + 4 * b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_and(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate step by step\nresult_hash = operation_hash(3, 4)\nresult_at = operation_at(result_hash, 5)\nresult_and = operation_and(result_at, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_and)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result. Let's proceed to the final answer.\n\n<<<19#5@6&1.8>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches the expected result of 1.8. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19#5@6&1.8>>>"
