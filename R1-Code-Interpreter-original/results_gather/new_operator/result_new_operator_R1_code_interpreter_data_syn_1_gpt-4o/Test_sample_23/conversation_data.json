    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol `$`. According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\$ b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a \\$ b = 3 \\times a + 3 \\times b \\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\((5 \\$ 9) \\$ 4\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 5 \\$ 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   5 \\$ 9 = 3 \\times 5 + 3 \\times 9\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((5 \\$ 9) \\$ 4\\):\n   \\[\n   (5 \\$ 9) \\$ 4 = 3 \\times (5 \\$ 9) + 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a $ b\ndef dollar_operation(a, b):\n    return 3 * a + 3 * b\n\n# Calculate 5 $ 9\nresult_5_9 = dollar_operation(5, 9)\n\n# Calculate (5 $ 9) $ 4\nfinal_result = dollar_operation(result_5_9, 4)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\((5 \\$ 9) \\$ 4\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of the operation \\((5 \\$ 9) \\$ 4\\) as 138. \n\nLet's break down the calculations:\n\n1. Calculate \\(5 \\$ 9\\):\n   \\[\n   5 \\$ 9 = 3 \\times 5 + 3 \\times 9 = 15 + 27 = 42\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((5 \\$ 9) \\$ 4\\):\n   \\[\n   (5 \\$ 9) \\$ 4 = 3 \\times 42 + 3 \\times 4 = 126 + 12 = 138\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final result of \\((5 \\$ 9) \\$ 4\\) is 138.\n\n<<<138>>>"
