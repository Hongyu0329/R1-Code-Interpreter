    "To solve the expression \\((3&4)~5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3&4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 3a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3&4 = 3 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3&4)~5\\):**\n   - First, calculate \\(3&4\\) from step 1.\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 4ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = (3&4)\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     (3&4)~5 = 4 \\times (3&4) \\times 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(((3&4)~5)@6\\):**\n   - First, calculate \\((3&4)~5\\) from step 2.\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = (3&4)~5\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     ((3&4)~5)@6 = \\frac{((3&4)~5) + 6}{6}\n     \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3&4\na = 3\nb = 4\nc = 5\nd = 6\n\nresult_3_and_4 = 3 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3&4)~5\nresult_3_and_4_tilde_5 = 4 * result_3_and_4 * c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3&4)~5)@6\nfinal_result = (result_3_and_4_tilde_5 + d) / d\n\nprint(result_3_and_4, result_3_and_4_tilde_5, final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the results.",
