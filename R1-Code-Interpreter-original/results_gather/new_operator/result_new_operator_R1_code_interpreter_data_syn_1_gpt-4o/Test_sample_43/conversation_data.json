    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the custom operation defined as a%b = 2*a + 2*b. This is not the standard modulus operation but a custom one.\n\nGiven the expression (6%9)%5, we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate 6%9 using the custom operation:\n   - According to the definition, 6%9 = 2*6 + 2*9.\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate the next operation with 5:\n   - Let the result from step 1 be x. Then, calculate x%5 using the custom operation:\n   - x%5 = 2*x + 2*5.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the custom operation\ndef custom_mod(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 2 * b\n\n# Step 1: Calculate 6%9\nresult_1 = custom_mod(6, 9)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate result_1%5\nfinal_result = custom_mod(result_1, 5)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 70. This means that the expression (6%9)%5, using the custom operation defined as a%b = 2*a + 2*b, evaluates to 70.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<70>>>"
