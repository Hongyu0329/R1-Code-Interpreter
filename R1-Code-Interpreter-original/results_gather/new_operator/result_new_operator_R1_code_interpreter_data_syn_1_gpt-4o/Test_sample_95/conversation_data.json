    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol \"~\". According to the problem, for two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a \\sim b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\]\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\( (4 \\sim 8) \\sim 4 \\).\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 4 \\sim 8 \\):**\n\n   Using the definition, we have:\n\n   \\[ 4 \\sim 8 = \\frac{4 + 8}{8} = \\frac{12}{8} = 1.5 \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 1.5 \\sim 4 \\):**\n\n   Now, using the result from the first step, we calculate:\n\n   \\[ 1.5 \\sim 4 = \\frac{1.5 + 4}{4} = \\frac{5.5}{4} = 1.375 \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\( (4 \\sim 8) \\sim 4 \\) is 1.375.\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a ~ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (4 ~ 8) ~ 4\nresult = operation(operation(4, 8), 4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed our manual calculation. Therefore, the final answer to the problem \\( (4 \\sim 8) \\sim 4 \\) is:\n\n<<<1.375>>>"
