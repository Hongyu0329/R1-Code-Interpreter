    "To solve the expression \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\&6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the defined operations step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\$4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\$4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\):**\n   - We already calculated \\(3\\$4 = 12\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 5 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(12\\sim5 = 5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 5 = 60 + 25 = 85\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\&6\\):**\n   - We already calculated \\((3\\$4)\\sim5 = 85\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 4 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(85\\&6 = 4 \\times 85 \\times 6\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the final step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 5 * b\n\ndef operation_ampersand(a, b):\n    return 4 * a * b\n\n# Calculate each step\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(3, 4)\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(result_dollar, 5)\nresult_ampersand = operation_ampersand(result_tilde, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_ampersand)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\&6\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 2040. This means that the final result of the expression \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\&6\\) is 2040.\n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. \\(3\\$4 = 12\\)\n2. \\((3\\$4)\\sim5 = 85\\)\n3. \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\&6 = 2040\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3$4 = 12, (3$4)~5 = 85, (3$4)~5&6 = 2040>>>"
