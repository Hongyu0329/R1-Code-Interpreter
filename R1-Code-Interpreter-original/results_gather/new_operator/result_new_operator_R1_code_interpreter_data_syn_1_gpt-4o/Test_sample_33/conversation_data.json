    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\& b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\nGiven the expression \\((7 \\& 8) \\& 3\\), we need to evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 7 \\& 8 \\).\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate the next operation with 3.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Calculate \\( 7 \\& 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   7 \\& 8 = \\frac{7 + 8}{8} = \\frac{15}{8}\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((7 \\& 8) \\& 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{15}{8}\\right) \\& 3 = \\frac{\\frac{15}{8} + 3}{3}\n   \\]\n\nTo compute this, let's use Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 7 & 8\nresult_1 = (7 + 8) / 8\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (7 & 8) & 3\nresult_2 = (result_1 + 3) / 3\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_2)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result for the expression \\((7 \\& 8) \\& 3\\).\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. Calculate \\( 7 \\& 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   7 \\& 8 = \\frac{7 + 8}{8} = \\frac{15}{8} = 1.875\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((7 \\& 8) \\& 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{15}{8}\\right) \\& 3 = \\frac{1.875 + 3}{3} = \\frac{4.875}{3} = 1.625\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((7 \\& 8) \\& 3\\) is 1.625.\n\n<<<1.625>>>"
