    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)$5%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 2*a + 5*b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3@4 = 2*3 + 5*4\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the result of \\(3@4\\) with \\(5\\) using the \\($\\) operation:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a$b = (a + b)/b\\).\n   - Use the result from step 1 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - Calculate \\((3@4)$5 = (result + 5)/5\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the result of \\((3@4)$5\\) with \\(6\\) using the \\(%\\) operation:**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a%b = 1*a*b\\).\n   - Use the result from step 2 as \\(a\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - Calculate \\((3@4)$5%6 = 1*result*6\\).\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3@4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = 2 * a + 5 * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3@4)$5\nb = 5\nresult_2 = (result_1 + b) / b\n\n# Step 3: Calculate (3@4)$5%6\nb = 6\nresult_3 = 1 * result_2 * b\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the results for each step of the calculation. Let's break down the results:\n\n1. **\\(3@4\\):** The result is 26.\n   - Calculation: \\(2*3 + 5*4 = 6 + 20 = 26\\).\n\n2. **\\((3@4)$5\\):** The result is 6.2.\n   - Calculation: \\((26 + 5)/5 = 31/5 = 6.2\\).\n\n3. **\\((3@4)$5%6\\):** The result is 37.2.\n   - Calculation: \\(1*6.2*6 = 37.2\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3@4)$5%6\\) is 37.2.\n\n<<<26, 6.2, 37.2>>>"
