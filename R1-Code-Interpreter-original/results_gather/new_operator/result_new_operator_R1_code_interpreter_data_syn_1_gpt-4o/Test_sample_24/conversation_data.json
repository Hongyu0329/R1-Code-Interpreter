    "To solve the expression \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\%6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the custom operations as defined:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\$4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 5 \\times a + 1 \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - \\(3\\$4 = 5 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\):**\n   - Now, we have \\(19\\sim5\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 19\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - \\(19\\sim5 = 1 \\times 19 \\times 5 = 95\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\%6\\):**\n   - Now, we have \\(95\\%6\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 95\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - \\(95\\%6 = 2 \\times 95 \\times 6 = 1140\\).\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef custom_dollar(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 1 * b\n\ndef custom_tilde(a, b):\n    return 1 * a * b\n\ndef custom_percent(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3$4)~5%6\nresult = custom_percent(custom_tilde(custom_dollar(3, 4), 5), 6)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1140>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches the expected result. Therefore, the final answer to the expression \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\%6\\) is:\n\n<<<1140>>>"
