    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**  \n   According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).  \n   So, \\(3\\#4 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the result of the first operation:**  \n   We will compute \\(3\\#4\\) using the formula.\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\):**  \n   According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).  \n   So, \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 3 \\times (3\\#4) \\times 5\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the result of the second operation:**  \n   We will compute \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\) using the formula.\n\n5. **Calculate \\(((3\\#4)\\&5)\\$6\\):**  \n   According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).  \n   So, \\(((3\\#4)\\&5)\\$6 = 2 \\times ((3\\#4)\\&5) \\times 6\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the result of the third operation:**  \n   We will compute \\(((3\\#4)\\&5)\\$6\\) using the formula.\n\nLet's compute these step by step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3#4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = 2 * a * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3#4)&5\nc = 5\nresult_2 = 3 * result_1 * c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3#4)&5)$6\nd = 6\nresult_3 = 2 * result_2 * d\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
