    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol `$`. According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\$ b \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ a \\$ b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\]\n\nWe need to calculate \\( (10 \\$ 3) \\$ 8 \\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 10 \\$ 3 \\):**\n\n   Using the definition:\n   \\[\n   10 \\$ 3 = \\frac{10 + 3}{3} = \\frac{13}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( (10 \\$ 3) \\$ 8 \\):**\n\n   First, substitute the result from step 1:\n   \\[\n   (10 \\$ 3) \\$ 8 = \\left(\\frac{13}{3}\\right) \\$ 8\n   \\]\n\n   Using the definition again:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{13}{3}\\right) \\$ 8 = \\frac{\\frac{13}{3} + 8}{8}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13}{3} + 8 = \\frac{13}{3} + \\frac{24}{3} = \\frac{37}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{13}{3}\\right) \\$ 8 = \\frac{\\frac{37}{3}}{8} = \\frac{37}{24}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a $ b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate (10 $ 3) $ 8\nresult = operation(operation(10, 3), 8)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result. Let's proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe result of the calculation is \\(\\frac{37}{24}\\).\n\n<<<37/24>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matches the expected result of the calculation. The operation \\( (10 \\$ 3) \\$ 8 \\) evaluates to approximately 1.5416666666666665, which is the decimal representation of the fraction \\(\\frac{37}{24}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<37/24>>>"
