    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol `$`. According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\$ b \\) is defined as \\( 3 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\((7 \\$ 5) \\$ 7\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 7 \\$ 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   7 \\$ 5 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((7 \\$ 5) \\$ 7\\):\n   \\[\n   (7 \\$ 5) \\$ 7 = 3 \\times (7 \\$ 5) \\times 7\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation\ndef dollar_operation(a, b):\n    return 3 * a * b\n\n# Calculate 7 $ 5\nresult_7_5 = dollar_operation(7, 5)\n\n# Calculate (7 $ 5) $ 7\nfinal_result = dollar_operation(result_7_5, 7)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for \\((7 \\$ 5) \\$ 7\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 2205. This means that the calculation for \\((7 \\$ 5) \\$ 7\\) is correct.\n\nLet's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. Calculate \\( 7 \\$ 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   7 \\$ 5 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 5 = 105\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\((7 \\$ 5) \\$ 7\\):\n   \\[\n   (7 \\$ 5) \\$ 7 = 3 \\times 105 \\times 7 = 2205\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2205>>>"
