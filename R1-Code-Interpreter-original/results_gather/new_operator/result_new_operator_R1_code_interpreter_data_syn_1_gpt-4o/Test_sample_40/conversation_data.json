    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)#5$6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Operation \\(a~b\\):** This is defined as \\(1 \\times a \\times b\\). So, \\(3~4\\) would be \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Operation \\(a#b\\):** This is defined as \\((a + b)/b\\). We need to evaluate \\((12)#5\\) next. This would be \\((12 + 5)/5 = 17/5\\).\n\n3. **Operation \\(a$b\\):** This is defined as \\((a + b)/b\\). Finally, we evaluate \\((17/5)$6\\). This would be \\(((17/5) + 6)/6\\).\n\nLet's calculate the final result using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3~4\nresult_1 = 1 * 3 * 4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (result_1)#5\nresult_2 = (result_1 + 5) / 5\n\n# Step 3: Calculate (result_2)$6\nresult_3 = (result_2 + 6) / 6\n\nprint(result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final result of the expression \\((3~4)#5$6\\) is approximately 1.5666666666666667.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<1.5666666666666667>>>"
