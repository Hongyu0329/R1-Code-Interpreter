    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((3&4)~5@6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the defined operations step by step.\n\n1. Calculate \\(3 & 4\\):\n   \\[\n   3 & 4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\((3 & 4) ~ 5\\), which is \\(12 ~ 5\\):\n   \\[\n   12 ~ 5 = 3 \\times 12 \\times 5 = 180\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate \\((3 & 4) ~ 5 @ 6\\), which is \\(180 @ 6\\):\n   \\[\n   180 @ 6 = 2 \\times 180 + 2 \\times 6 = 360 + 12 = 372\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's express the calculation in the requested format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<3, 4, &, 5, ~, 6, @>>>}\n\\]\n\nThe final result of the expression is 372."
