    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\(12\\$5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(12\\$5 = \\frac{12 + 5}{5} = \\frac{17}{5} = 3.4\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(3.4@6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3.4@6 = \\frac{3.4 + 6}{6} = \\frac{9.4}{6}\\).\n\nLet's calculate the final result for \\(3.4@6\\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the final result for 3.4@6\na = 3.4\nb = 6\nresult = (a + b) / b\nresult\nassistant > The final result of the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\) is approximately \\(1.5667\\).\n\nThe step-by-step evaluation is as follows:\n- \\(3~4 = 12\\)\n- \\(12\\$5 = 3.4\\)\n- \\(3.4@6 \\approx 1.5667\\)\n\nThus, the answer is in the format: <<<12, $, 3.4, @, 1.5667>>>"
