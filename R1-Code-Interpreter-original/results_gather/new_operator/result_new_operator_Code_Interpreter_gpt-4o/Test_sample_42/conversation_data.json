    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((3&4)#5~6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the defined operations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Calculate \\(3&4\\):\n   \\[\n   3&4 = 4 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate \\((3&4)#5\\):\n   \\[\n   24#5 = 3 \\times 24 + 2 \\times 5 = 72 + 10 = 82\n   \\]\n\n3. Use the result from step 2 to calculate \\(((3&4)#5)~6\\):\n   \\[\n   82~6 = 1 \\times 82 + 4 \\times 6 = 82 + 24 = 106\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the requested format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\n\\[\n<<<3, &, 4, =, 24, #, 5, =, 82, ~, 6, =, 106>>>\n\\]"
