    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((3 \\# 4) @ 5 \\sim 6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the defined operations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Calculate \\(3 \\# 4\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\# 4 = 4 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 12 + 4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\((3 \\# 4) @ 5\\), which is \\(16 @ 5\\):\n   \\[\n   16 @ 5 = 2 \\times 16 \\times 5 = 160\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate \\(((3 \\# 4) @ 5) \\sim 6\\), which is \\(160 \\sim 6\\):\n   \\[\n   160 \\sim 6 = 3 \\times 160 + 3 \\times 6 = 480 + 18 = 498\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the requested format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\n\\[\n<<<3, \\#, 4, =, 16, @, 5, =, 160, \\sim, 6, =, 498>>>\n\\]"
