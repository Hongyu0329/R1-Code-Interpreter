    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((3&4)#5~6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the defined operations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Calculate \\(3 & 4\\):\n   \\[\n   3 & 4 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\((3 & 4) # 5\\):\n   \\[\n   48 # 5 = 2 \\times 48 \\times 5 = 480\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate \\(((3 & 4) # 5) ~ 6\\):\n   \\[\n   480 ~ 6 = 4 \\times 480 + 5 \\times 6 = 1920 + 30 = 1950\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the requested format:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<} 3, \\&, 4, \\#, 5, \\sim, 6 \\text{>>>} = 1950\n\\]"
