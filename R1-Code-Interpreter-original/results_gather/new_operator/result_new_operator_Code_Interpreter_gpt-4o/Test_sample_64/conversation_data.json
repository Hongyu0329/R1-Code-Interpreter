    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)@5&6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and evaluate each operation step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   \\[\n   3\\#4 = 1 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 4 = 3 + 16 = 19\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)@5\\):**\n   \\[\n   19@5 = \\frac{19 + 5}{5} = \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(((3\\#4)@5)&6\\):**\n   \\[\n   4.8&6 = \\frac{4.8 + 6}{6} = \\frac{10.8}{6} = 1.8\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's present the answer in the requested format: <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<} 3, \\#, 4, @, 5, &, 6 \\text{>>>}\n\\]\n\nThe final result of the expression is \\(1.8\\)."
