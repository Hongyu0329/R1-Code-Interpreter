    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the defined operations step by step.\n\n1. Calculate \\(3~4\\):\n   \\[\n   3~4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\((3~4)&5\\):\n   \\[\n   12&5 = 5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 5 = 60 + 25 = 85\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate \\(5@6\\):\n   \\[\n   5@6 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 90\n   \\]\n\nNow, we have the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\) which simplifies to \\(85@6\\).\n\n4. Calculate \\(85@6\\):\n   \\[\n   85@6 = 3 \\times 85 \\times 6\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute the final result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the final result of the expression (3~4)&5@6\na_tilde_b = 1 * 3 * 4\na_and_b = 5 * a_tilde_b + 5 * 5\na_at_b = 3 * 5 * 6\n\nfinal_result = 3 * a_and_b * 6\nfinal_result\nassistant > The final result of the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\) is 1530.\n\nThe steps involved in the calculation are as follows:\n- \\(3~4 = 12\\)\n- \\((3~4)&5 = 85\\)\n- \\(5@6 = 90\\)\n- \\((3~4)&5@6 = 1530\\)\n\nThus, the expression evaluates to <<<1530>>>."
