    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((3&4)@5%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3 & 4\\):**\n   \\[\n   3 & 4 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3 & 4) @ 5\\):**\n   \\[\n   36 @ 5 = \\frac{36 + 5}{5} = \\frac{41}{5} = 8.2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(((3 & 4) @ 5) % 6\\):**\n   \\[\n   8.2 % 6 = \\frac{8.2 + 6}{6} = \\frac{14.2}{6} \\approx 2.3667\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<} [3, \\&, 4, @, 5, \\%, 6] \\text{>>>}\n\\]\n\nThe final result of the expression is approximately \\(2.3667\\)."
