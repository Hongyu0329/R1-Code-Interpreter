    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the steps and apply the given definition of the operation `%`. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation `%`:**  \n   According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\% b \\) is defined as \\( 4 \\times a + 4 \\times b \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 2 \\% 8 \\):**  \n   - Here, \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 8 \\).\n   - Using the definition, \\( 2 \\% 8 = 4 \\times 2 + 4 \\times 8 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\).\n   - Add the results: \\( 8 + 32 = 40 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 2 \\% 8 = 40 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\( 40 \\% 5 \\):**  \n   - Now, \\( a = 40 \\) and \\( b = 5 \\).\n   - Using the definition, \\( 40 \\% 5 = 4 \\times 40 + 4 \\times 5 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\).\n   - Add the results: \\( 160 + 20 = 180 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 40 \\% 5 = 180 \\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**  \n   - The final result of the expression \\( (2 \\% 8) \\% 5 \\) is 180.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<2, %, 8, =, 40, %, 5, =, 180>>>"
