    "To solve the expression (3@4)#5$6, we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate 3@4:**\n   - According to the definition, a@b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the operation: \n     \\[\n     3@4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate (3@4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3@4 as 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a#b is 2*a + 3*b.\n   - Substitute a = 7/4 and b = 5 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     (3@4)#5 = 2 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 3 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each part:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times \\frac{7}{4} = \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{7}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 5 = 15\n     \\]\n   - Add the results:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7}{2} + 15 = \\frac{7}{2} + \\frac{30}{2} = \\frac{37}{2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate ((3@4)#5)$6:**\n   - We have calculated (3@4)#5 as 37/2.\n   - According to the definition, a$b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 37/2 and b = 6 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     ((3@4)#5)$6 = \\frac{\\frac{37}{2} + 6}{6}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the numerator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{37}{2} + 6 = \\frac{37}{2} + \\frac{12}{2} = \\frac{49}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 6:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{49}{2} \\div 6 = \\frac{49}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{49}{12}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3@4, #5, $6, 49/12>>>"
