    "To solve the expression (3$4)#5~6, we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate 3$4:**\n   - According to the definition, a$b = 2*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3\\$4 = 2*3 + 5*4 = 6 + 20 = 26\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate (3$4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3$4 = 26.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 5*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 26 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     26\\#5 = 5*26*5 = 650\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate (3$4)#5~6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3$4)#5 = 650.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 650 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     650\\sim6 = \\frac{650 + 6}{6} = \\frac{656}{6} = 109.3333\\ldots\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3$4, 26, #5, 650, ~6, 109.3333>>>"
