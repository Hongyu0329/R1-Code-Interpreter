    "To solve the expression (3#4)@5~6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the formula: \n     \\[\n     3#4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3#4)@5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 = 1.75.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 5*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 1.75 and b = 5 into the formula:\n     \\[\n     (3#4)@5 = 5 \\times 1.75 + 5 \\times 5 = 8.75 + 25 = 33.75\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3#4)@5~6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3#4)@5 = 33.75.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 3*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 33.75 and b = 6 into the formula:\n     \\[\n     (3#4)@5~6 = 3 \\times 33.75 \\times 6 = 607.5\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, #, 4, @, 5, ~, 6, =, 607.5>>>"
