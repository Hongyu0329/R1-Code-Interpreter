    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"@\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"@\"**:  \n   The operation a@b is defined as (a + b)/b. This means you add a and b together, then divide the result by b.\n\n2. **Calculate 9@4**:  \n   - According to the definition, 9@4 = (9 + 4)/4.\n   - First, calculate the sum: 9 + 4 = 13.\n   - Then, divide by 4: 13/4 = 3.25.\n\n3. **Use the result to calculate (9@4)@3**:  \n   - We found that 9@4 = 3.25. Now we need to calculate 3.25@3.\n   - According to the definition, 3.25@3 = (3.25 + 3)/3.\n   - First, calculate the sum: 3.25 + 3 = 6.25.\n   - Then, divide by 3: 6.25/3 = 2.0833 (rounded to four decimal places).\n\n4. **Final answer**:  \n   The final result of (9@4)@3 is 2.0833.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<9, @, 4, =, 3.25, @, 3, =, 2.0833>>>"
