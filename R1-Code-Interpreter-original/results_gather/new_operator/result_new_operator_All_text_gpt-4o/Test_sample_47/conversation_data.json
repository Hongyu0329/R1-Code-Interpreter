    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition and the operations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation \"@\" is defined as \\( a@b = 5 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 4@7 \\)**:\n   - Substitute \\( a = 4 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\) into the definition.\n   - \\( 4@7 = 5 \\times 4 \\times 7 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 20 \\times 7 = 140 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 4@7 = 140 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\( (4@7)@2 \\)**:\n   - We have already calculated \\( 4@7 = 140 \\).\n   - Now substitute \\( a = 140 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\) into the definition.\n   - \\( 140@2 = 5 \\times 140 \\times 2 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 5 \\times 140 = 700 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 700 \\times 2 = 1400 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( (4@7)@2 = 1400 \\).\n\n4. **Final answer**: The final result of the operation \\( (4@7)@2 \\) is 1400.\n\nThe answer is: <<<4, @, 7, =, 140, @, 2, =, 1400>>>"
