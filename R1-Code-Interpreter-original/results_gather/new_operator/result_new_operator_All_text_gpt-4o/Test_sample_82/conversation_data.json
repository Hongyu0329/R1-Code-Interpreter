    "To solve the expression (3@4)%5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3@4:**\n   - According to the definition, a@b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the formula: (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Calculate (3@4)%5:**\n   - First, we need the result of 3@4, which is 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a%b is 4*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 7/4 and b = 5 into the formula: 4*(7/4) + 4*5.\n   - Simplify: 4*(7/4) = 7 and 4*5 = 20.\n   - Therefore, (7/4)%5 = 7 + 20 = 27.\n\n3. **Calculate (3@4)%5#6:**\n   - We have the result of (3@4)%5, which is 27.\n   - According to the definition, a#b is 1*a + 1*b.\n   - Substitute a = 27 and b = 6 into the formula: 1*27 + 1*6.\n   - Simplify: 27 + 6 = 33.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, @, 4, %, 5, #, 6, =, 33>>>"
