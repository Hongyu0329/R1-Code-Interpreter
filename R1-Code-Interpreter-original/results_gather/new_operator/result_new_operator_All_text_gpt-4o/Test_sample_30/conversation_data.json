    "To solve the expression (3~4)&5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation `a~b` is defined as \\(3a + 1b\\).\n   - The operation `a&b` is defined as \\(3ab\\).\n   - The operation `a#b` is defined as \\(1ab\\).\n\n2. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - Using the definition of `a~b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     3~4 = 3 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 9 + 4 = 13\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)&5:**\n   - We now substitute the result from step 2 into the operation `a&b`:\n     \\[\n     13&5 = 3 \\times 13 \\times 5 = 195\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate (3~4)&5#6:**\n   - Finally, we use the result from step 3 in the operation `a#b`:\n     \\[\n     195#6 = 1 \\times 195 \\times 6 = 1170\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<3, ~, 4, &, 5, #, 6, =, 1170>>>"
