    "To solve the expression \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the given operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\$4\\):**\n   - The operation \\(a\\$b\\) is defined as \\(5 \\times a + 1 \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\) into the operation:\n     \\[\n     3\\$4 = 5 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\$4 = 19\\).\n   - The operation \\(a\\sim b\\) is defined as \\(1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 19\\) and \\(b = 5\\) into the operation:\n     \\[\n     19\\sim5 = 1 \\times 19 \\times 5 = 95\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\%6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\$4)\\sim5 = 95\\).\n   - The operation \\(a\\%b\\) is defined as \\(2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 95\\) and \\(b = 6\\) into the operation:\n     \\[\n     95\\%6 = 2 \\times 95 \\times 6 = 1140\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, $, 4, ~, 5, %, 6, =, 1140>>>"
