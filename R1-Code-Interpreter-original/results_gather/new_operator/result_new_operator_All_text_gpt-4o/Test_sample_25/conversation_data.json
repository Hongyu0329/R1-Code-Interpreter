    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the operation defined and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:**\n   - The operation a@b is defined as 1 * a * b. This means that for any two numbers a and b, a@b is simply the product of a and b, since multiplying by 1 does not change the value.\n\n2. **Calculate 6@9:**\n   - According to the definition, 6@9 = 1 * 6 * 9.\n   - Calculate the product: 6 * 9 = 54.\n   - Therefore, 6@9 = 54.\n\n3. **Calculate (6@9)@4:**\n   - We have already determined that 6@9 = 54.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 54@4.\n   - According to the definition, 54@4 = 1 * 54 * 4.\n   - Calculate the product: 54 * 4 = 216.\n   - Therefore, (6@9)@4 = 216.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the operation (6@9)@4 is 216.\n\nThe answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<6, @, 9, @, 4, =, 216>>>"
