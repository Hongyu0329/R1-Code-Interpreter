    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"~\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"~\":**\n   - The operation \"~\" is defined as \\( a \\sim b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 6 \\sim 1 \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( a = 6 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\) into the operation definition:\n   \\[\n   6 \\sim 1 = \\frac{6 + 1}{1} = \\frac{7}{1} = 7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\( 7 \\sim 9 \\):**\n   - Now, use the result from the previous step as the new \"a\" and substitute \\( b = 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   7 \\sim 9 = \\frac{7 + 9}{9} = \\frac{16}{9}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the operation \\( (6 \\sim 1) \\sim 9 \\) is \\(\\frac{16}{9}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<6, ~, 1, =, 7, ~, 9, =, 16/9>>>"
