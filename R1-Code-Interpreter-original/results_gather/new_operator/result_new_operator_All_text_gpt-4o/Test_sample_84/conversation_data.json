    "To solve the expression (3#4)$5%6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the operation: \n     \\[\n     3#4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3#4)$5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 as 1.75.\n   - According to the definition, a$b is 2*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 1.75 and b = 5 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     (3#4)$5 = 2*1.75 + 5*5 = 3.5 + 25 = 28.5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate ((3#4)$5)%6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3#4)$5 as 28.5.\n   - According to the definition, a%b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 28.5 and b = 6 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     ((3#4)$5)%6 = \\frac{28.5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{34.5}{6} = 5.75\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression (3#4)$5%6 is:\n\n<<<3#4, 1.75, (3#4)$5, 28.5, ((3#4)$5)%6, 5.75>>>"
