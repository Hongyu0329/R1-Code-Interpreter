    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"&\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"&\":**\n   - The operation a&b is defined as 2 * a * b.\n\n2. **Calculate 7&5:**\n   - According to the definition, 7&5 = 2 * 7 * 5.\n   - Calculate 2 * 7 = 14.\n   - Then, calculate 14 * 5 = 70.\n   - So, 7&5 = 70.\n\n3. **Calculate (7&5)&9:**\n   - We have already calculated 7&5 = 70.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 70&9.\n   - According to the definition, 70&9 = 2 * 70 * 9.\n   - Calculate 2 * 70 = 140.\n   - Then, calculate 140 * 9 = 1260.\n   - So, (7&5)&9 = 1260.\n\n4. **Format the answer:**\n   - We need to return the answer in the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<7, &, 5, &, 9, =, 1260>>>"
