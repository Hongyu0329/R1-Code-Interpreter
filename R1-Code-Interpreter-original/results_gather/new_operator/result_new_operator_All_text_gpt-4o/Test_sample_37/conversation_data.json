    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by \\( a \\sim b \\), which is given as \\( 3a + 2b \\). We are asked to calculate \\( (10 \\sim 4) \\sim 3 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 10 \\sim 4 \\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\( a \\sim b = 3a + 2b \\).\n   - Substitute \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 4 \\) into the expression:\n     \\[\n     10 \\sim 4 = 3 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 4\n     \\]\n   - Perform the multiplications:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 10 = 30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 4 = 8\n     \\]\n   - Add the results:\n     \\[\n     30 + 8 = 38\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( 10 \\sim 4 = 38 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 38 \\sim 3 \\):**\n   - Now, we need to calculate \\( 38 \\sim 3 \\) using the same operation definition.\n   - Substitute \\( a = 38 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\) into the expression:\n     \\[\n     38 \\sim 3 = 3 \\times 38 + 2 \\times 3\n     \\]\n   - Perform the multiplications:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 38 = 114\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 3 = 6\n     \\]\n   - Add the results:\n     \\[\n     114 + 6 = 120\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( 38 \\sim 3 = 120 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem \\( (10 \\sim 4) \\sim 3 \\) is 120.\n\nThe answer in the requested format is:\n<<<10, ~, 4, =, 38, ~, 3, =, 120>>>"
