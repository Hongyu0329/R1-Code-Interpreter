    "To solve the expression (3%4)#5~6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3%4:**\n   - According to the definition, a%b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Calculate (3%4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3%4 as 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a#b is 5*a + 1*b.\n   - Substitute a = 7/4 and b = 5 into the expression: 5*(7/4) + 1*5.\n   - Calculate 5*(7/4) = 35/4.\n   - Add 35/4 and 5: 35/4 + 5 = 35/4 + 20/4 = 55/4.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3%4)#5)~6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3%4)#5 as 55/4.\n   - According to the definition, a~b is 3*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 55/4 and b = 6 into the expression: 3*(55/4)*6.\n   - Calculate 3*(55/4)*6 = (3*55*6)/4 = 990/4.\n   - Simplify 990/4: 990/4 = 247.5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, %, 4, #, 5, ~, 6, =, 247.5>>>"
