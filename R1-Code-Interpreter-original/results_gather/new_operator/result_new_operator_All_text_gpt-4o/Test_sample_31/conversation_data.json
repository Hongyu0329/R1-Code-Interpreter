    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \\( a \\# b \\) and apply it step by step to the given expression \\((3 \\# 2) \\# 6\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation:**\n   - The operation \\( a \\# b \\) is defined as \\((a + b) / b\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 3 \\# 2 \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\) into the operation:\n     \\[\n     3 \\# 2 = \\frac{3 + 2}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3 \\# 2) \\# 6\\):**\n   - Now, substitute \\( a = 2.5 \\) (the result from the previous step) and \\( b = 6 \\) into the operation:\n     \\[\n     (3 \\# 2) \\# 6 = \\frac{2.5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{8.5}{6}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Final Expression:**\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{8.5}{6}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8.5}{6} = 1.4167 \\quad (\\text{rounded to four decimal places})\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer, expressed in the required format, is:\n\n<<<3, #, 2, =, 2.5, #, 6, =, 1.4167>>>"
