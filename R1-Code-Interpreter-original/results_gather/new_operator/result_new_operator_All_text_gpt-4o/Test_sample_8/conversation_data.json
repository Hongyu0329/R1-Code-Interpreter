    "To solve the expression (3%4)$5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3%4:**\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 3*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the formula: \n     \\[\n     3\\%4 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 36\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3%4)$5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3%4 = 36.\n   - According to the definition, a$b = 5*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 36 and b = 5 into the formula:\n     \\[\n     36\\$5 = 5 \\times 36 + 4 \\times 5 = 180 + 20 = 200\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate ((3%4)$5)#6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3%4)$5 = 200.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 2*a + 2*b.\n   - Substitute a = 200 and b = 6 into the formula:\n     \\[\n     200\\#6 = 2 \\times 200 + 2 \\times 6 = 400 + 12 = 412\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression (3%4)$5#6 is 412.\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n<<<3, %, 4, $, 5, #, 6, =, 412>>>"
