    "To solve the expression (3#4)$5&6 using the defined operations, we need to evaluate it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 4*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3#4 = 4*3 + 5*4 = 12 + 20 = 32\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate (3#4)$5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 = 32.\n   - According to the definition, a$b = 4*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 32 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     32$5 = 4*32 + 5*5 = 128 + 25 = 153\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate ((3#4)$5)&6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3#4)$5 = 153.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = 4*a + 1*b.\n   - Substitute a = 153 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     153&6 = 4*153 + 1*6 = 612 + 6 = 618\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression (3#4)$5&6 is 618.\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n<<<3, #, 4, $, 5, &, 6>>> = 618"
