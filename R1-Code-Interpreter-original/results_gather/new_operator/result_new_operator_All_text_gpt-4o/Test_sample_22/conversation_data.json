    "To solve the expression (3~4)#5&6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 2*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the formula: \n     \\[\n     3~4 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3~4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3~4 = 24.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 4*a + 3*b.\n   - Substitute a = 24 and b = 5 into the formula:\n     \\[\n     24#5 = 4 \\times 24 + 3 \\times 5 = 96 + 15 = 111\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)#5&6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3~4)#5 = 111.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 111 and b = 6 into the formula:\n     \\[\n     111&6 = \\frac{111 + 6}{6} = \\frac{117}{6} = 19.5\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression (3~4)#5&6 is 19.5.\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n<<<3, ~, 4, #, 5, &, 6, =, 19.5>>>"
