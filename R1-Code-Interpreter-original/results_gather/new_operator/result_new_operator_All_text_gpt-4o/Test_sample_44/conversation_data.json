    "To solve the expression (3$4)~5&6 using the defined operations, we need to follow the order of operations and apply each operation step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation a$b is defined as 1 * a * b.\n   - The operation a~b is defined as 5 * a + 5 * b.\n   - The operation a&b is defined as 4 * a * b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3$4:**\n   - Using the definition of the $ operation: \n     \\[\n     3\\$4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3$4)~5:**\n   - We already found that 3$4 = 12.\n   - Now apply the ~ operation with 12 and 5:\n     \\[\n     12\\sim5 = 5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 5 = 60 + 25 = 85\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate (3$4)~5&6:**\n   - We found that (3$4)~5 = 85.\n   - Now apply the & operation with 85 and 6:\n     \\[\n     85\\&6 = 4 \\times 85 \\times 6 = 2040\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the expression (3$4)~5&6 is 2040.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<12, ~, 85, &, 2040>>>"
