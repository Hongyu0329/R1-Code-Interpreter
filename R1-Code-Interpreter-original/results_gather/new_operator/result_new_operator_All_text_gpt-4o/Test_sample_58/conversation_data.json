    "To solve the expression (3@4)$5%6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3@4:**\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 2*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3@4 = 2*3 + 5*4 = 6 + 20 = 26\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3@4)$5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3@4 = 26.\n   - According to the definition, a$b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 26 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     26$5 = (26 + 5)/5 = 31/5 = 6.2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate ((3@4)$5)%6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3@4)$5 = 6.2.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 1*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 6.2 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     6.2%6 = 1*6.2*6 = 37.2\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3@4, 26, $5, 6.2, %6, 37.2>>>"
