    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the expression and the operation defined.\n\n1. **Understand the operation $:**\n   - The operation a$b is defined as 1*a + 1*b.\n   - This simplifies to a + b, since multiplying by 1 does not change the value.\n\n2. **Break down the expression (1$8)$10:**\n   - The expression is (1$8)$10, which means we first need to evaluate 1$8, and then use the result to evaluate the next operation with 10.\n\n3. **Evaluate 1$8:**\n   - Using the definition of the operation, 1$8 = 1*1 + 1*8 = 1 + 8 = 9.\n\n4. **Evaluate 9$10:**\n   - Now, we use the result from the previous step to evaluate 9$10.\n   - Using the definition of the operation, 9$10 = 1*9 + 1*10 = 9 + 10 = 19.\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the expression (1$8)$10 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<1$8 = 9, 9$10 = 19>>>"
