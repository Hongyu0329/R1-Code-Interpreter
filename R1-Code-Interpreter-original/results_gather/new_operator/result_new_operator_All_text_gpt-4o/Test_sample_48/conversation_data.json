    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 1 \\cdot a + 4 \\cdot b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(3\\#4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 4 \\cdot 4 = 3 + 16 = 19\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\(5\\$6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(5\\$6 = \\frac{5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{11}{6}\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = 19\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 2 \\cdot a \\cdot b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 19\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - Calculate: \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 2 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 5 = 190\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\):**\n   - We have \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 190\\) and \\(5\\$6 = \\frac{11}{6}\\).\n   - Substitute these values into the expression.\n   - Calculate: \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6 = 190 \\cdot \\frac{11}{6} = \\frac{2090}{6} = 348.3333\\ldots\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3, #, 4, &, 5, $, 6>>> = 348.3333..."
