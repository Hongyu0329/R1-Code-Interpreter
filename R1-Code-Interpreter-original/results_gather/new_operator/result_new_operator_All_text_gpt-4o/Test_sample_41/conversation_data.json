    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"@\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"@\"**: \n   - The operation \"a@b\" is defined as 2 * a * b.\n\n2. **Calculate 2@10**:\n   - Here, a = 2 and b = 10.\n   - According to the definition, 2@10 = 2 * 2 * 10.\n   - Calculate: 2 * 2 = 4.\n   - Then, 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - So, 2@10 = 40.\n\n3. **Calculate (2@10)@5**:\n   - We have already calculated 2@10 = 40.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 40@5.\n   - Here, a = 40 and b = 5.\n   - According to the definition, 40@5 = 2 * 40 * 5.\n   - Calculate: 2 * 40 = 80.\n   - Then, 80 * 5 = 400.\n   - So, 40@5 = 400.\n\n4. **Final answer**:\n   - The result of (2@10)@5 is 400.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2, @, 10, @, 5, =, 400>>>"
