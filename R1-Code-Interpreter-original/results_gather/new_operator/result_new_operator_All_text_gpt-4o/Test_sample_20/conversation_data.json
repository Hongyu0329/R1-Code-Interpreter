    "To solve the expression (3%4)~5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3%4:**\n   - According to the definition, a%b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Calculate (3%4)~5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3%4 as 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a~b is 1*a + 1*b.\n   - Substitute a = 7/4 and b = 5 into the expression: 1*(7/4) + 1*5 = 7/4 + 5.\n   - Convert 5 to a fraction with a denominator of 4: 5 = 20/4.\n   - Add the fractions: 7/4 + 20/4 = 27/4.\n\n3. **Calculate (3%4)~5#6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3%4)~5 as 27/4.\n   - According to the definition, a#b is 4*a + 2*b.\n   - Substitute a = 27/4 and b = 6 into the expression: 4*(27/4) + 2*6.\n   - Simplify 4*(27/4): 4*(27/4) = 27.\n   - Calculate 2*6: 2*6 = 12.\n   - Add the results: 27 + 12 = 39.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7/4, ~, 5, #, 6, =, 39>>>"
