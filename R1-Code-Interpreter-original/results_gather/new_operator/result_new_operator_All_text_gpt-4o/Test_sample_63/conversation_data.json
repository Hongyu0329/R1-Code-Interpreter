    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\# b = 2a + 1b \\). This operation takes two numbers, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and computes the result by multiplying \\( a \\) by 2, multiplying \\( b \\) by 1, and then adding the two products together.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 3 \\# 9 \\):**\n   - According to the operation \\( a \\# b = 2a + 1b \\), substitute \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\).\n   - Compute \\( 2 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 9 \\).\n   - This simplifies to \\( 6 + 9 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 3 \\# 9 = 15 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( (3 \\# 9) \\# 3 \\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\( 3 \\# 9 = 15 \\).\n   - Now, substitute \\( a = 15 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\) into the operation.\n   - Compute \\( 2 \\times 15 + 1 \\times 3 \\).\n   - This simplifies to \\( 30 + 3 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 15 \\# 3 = 33 \\).\n\nBy following these steps, we have calculated the final result of the nested operation.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3#9 = 15, 15#3 = 33>>>"
