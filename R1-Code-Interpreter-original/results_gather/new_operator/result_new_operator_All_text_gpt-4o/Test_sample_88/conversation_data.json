    "To solve the expression (3#4)&5$6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation a#b is defined as 2 * a * b.\n   - The operation a&b is defined as 3 * a * b.\n   - The operation a$b is defined as 2 * a * b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - Using the definition of #, we have:\n     - 3#4 = 2 * 3 * 4\n     - 3#4 = 24\n\n3. **Calculate 5$6:**\n   - Using the definition of $, we have:\n     - 5$6 = 2 * 5 * 6\n     - 5$6 = 60\n\n4. **Calculate (3#4)&5$6:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 = 24 and 5$6 = 60.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 24&60 using the definition of &:\n     - 24&60 = 3 * 24 * 60\n     - 24&60 = 4320\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   - The expression (3#4)&5$6 evaluates to 4320.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<3#4=24, 5$6=60, 24&60=4320>>>"
