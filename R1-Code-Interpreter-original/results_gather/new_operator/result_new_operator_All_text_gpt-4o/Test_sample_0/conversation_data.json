    "To solve the expression (3~4)&5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation `a~b` is defined as \\(1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - The operation `a&b` is defined as \\(5 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n   - The operation `a@b` is defined as \\(3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n\n2. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - Using the definition of `a~b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     3~4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)&5:**\n   - We already found that \\(3~4 = 12\\).\n   - Now, using the definition of `a&b`, we calculate:\n     \\[\n     12&5 = 5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 5 = 60 + 25 = 85\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate 5@6:**\n   - Using the definition of `a@b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     5@6 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 90\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the results:**\n   - We need to calculate \\((3~4)&5@6\\), which is equivalent to \\(85@6\\).\n   - Using the definition of `a@b`, we calculate:\n     \\[\n     85@6 = 3 \\times 85 \\times 6 = 1530\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, ~, 4, &, 5, @, 6, =, 1530>>>"
