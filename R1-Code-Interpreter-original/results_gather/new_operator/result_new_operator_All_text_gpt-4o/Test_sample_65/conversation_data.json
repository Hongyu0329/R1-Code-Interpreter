    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition and the operations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation a#b is defined as 3 * a * b. This means for any two numbers a and b, a#b is calculated by multiplying a and b together and then multiplying the result by 3.\n\n2. **Calculate 2#9**:\n   - Here, a = 2 and b = 9.\n   - According to the definition, 2#9 = 3 * 2 * 9.\n   - First, calculate 2 * 9 = 18.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 18 = 54.\n   - So, 2#9 = 54.\n\n3. **Calculate (2#9)#1**:\n   - Now, we need to calculate (2#9)#1, which means we take the result of 2#9 and use it as the first number in the operation with 1 as the second number.\n   - We already found that 2#9 = 54.\n   - So, we need to calculate 54#1.\n   - Here, a = 54 and b = 1.\n   - According to the definition, 54#1 = 3 * 54 * 1.\n   - First, calculate 54 * 1 = 54.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 54 = 162.\n   - So, (2#9)#1 = 162.\n\nBy following these steps, we have calculated the final result.\n\nThe answer is: <<<2#9 = 54, 54#1 = 162>>>"
