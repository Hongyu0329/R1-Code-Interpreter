    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by \\( a \\sim b = 3a + 2b \\). We are asked to calculate \\((10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(10 \\sim 2\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\( a \\sim b = 3a + 2b \\).\n   - Substitute \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\) into the expression:\n     \\[\n     10 \\sim 2 = 3 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 2\n     \\]\n   - Perform the multiplications:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 10 = 30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2 = 4\n     \\]\n   - Add the results:\n     \\[\n     30 + 4 = 34\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( 10 \\sim 2 = 34 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(34 \\sim 2\\):**\n   - Now, we need to calculate \\((10 \\sim 2) \\sim 2\\), which is \\(34 \\sim 2\\).\n   - Again, use the definition \\( a \\sim b = 3a + 2b \\).\n   - Substitute \\( a = 34 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\) into the expression:\n     \\[\n     34 \\sim 2 = 3 \\times 34 + 2 \\times 2\n     \\]\n   - Perform the multiplications:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 34 = 102\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2 = 4\n     \\]\n   - Add the results:\n     \\[\n     102 + 4 = 106\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( 34 \\sim 2 = 106 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10, ~, 2, =, 34, ~, 2, =, 106>>>"
