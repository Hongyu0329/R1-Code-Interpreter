    "To solve the expression (3&4)#5~6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3&4:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b = 4*a + 3*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     - 3&4 = 4*3 + 3*4\n     - 3&4 = 12 + 12\n     - 3&4 = 24\n\n2. **Calculate (3&4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3&4 = 24.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 3*a + 2*b.\n   - Substitute a = 24 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     - 24#5 = 3*24 + 2*5\n     - 24#5 = 72 + 10\n     - 24#5 = 82\n\n3. **Calculate (3&4)#5~6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3&4)#5 = 82.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 1*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 82 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     - 82~6 = 1*82 + 4*6\n     - 82~6 = 82 + 24\n     - 82~6 = 106\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3&4, 24, #5, 82, ~6, 106>>>"
