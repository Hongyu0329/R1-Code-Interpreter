    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"&\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"&\":**\n   - The operation a&b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3&5:**\n   - According to the definition, 3&5 = (3 + 5)/5.\n   - Calculate the sum: 3 + 5 = 8.\n   - Divide by 5: 8/5 = 1.6.\n\n3. **Use the result from step 2 to calculate (3&5)&2:**\n   - We found that 3&5 = 1.6.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 1.6&2.\n   - According to the definition, 1.6&2 = (1.6 + 2)/2.\n   - Calculate the sum: 1.6 + 2 = 3.6.\n   - Divide by 2: 3.6/2 = 1.8.\n\n4. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of (3&5)&2 is 1.8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<3 + 5, 8/5, 1.6 + 2, 3.6/2, 1.8>>>"
