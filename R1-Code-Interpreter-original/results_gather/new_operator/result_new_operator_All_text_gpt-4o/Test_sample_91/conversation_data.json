    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"&\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"&\":**\n   - The operation a&b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3&2:**\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 2 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     3&2 = \\frac{3 + 2}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3&2)&3:**\n   - Now, we need to calculate (3&2)&3. We already found that 3&2 = 2.5.\n   - Substitute a = 2.5 and b = 3 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     (3&2)&3 = 2.5&3 = \\frac{2.5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{5.5}{3} = \\frac{11}{6}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final answer:**\n   - The final result of (3&2)&3 is \\(\\frac{11}{6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<3, &, 2, =, 2.5, &, 3, =, 11/6>>>"
