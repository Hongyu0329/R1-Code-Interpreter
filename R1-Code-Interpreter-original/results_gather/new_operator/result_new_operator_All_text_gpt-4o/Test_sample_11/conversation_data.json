    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given operation and apply it step by step. The operation is defined as \\( a \\sim b = 2a + 4b \\).\n\nWe are tasked with calculating \\( (2 \\sim 9) \\sim 9 \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 2 \\sim 9 \\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\( a \\sim b = 2a + 4b \\).\n   - Substitute \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\) into the expression:\n     \\[\n     2 \\sim 9 = 2(2) + 4(9)\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 2(2) = 4 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 4(9) = 36 \\).\n   - Add the results: \\( 4 + 36 = 40 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 2 \\sim 9 = 40 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 40 \\sim 9 \\):**\n   - Now, we need to calculate \\( (2 \\sim 9) \\sim 9 \\), which is \\( 40 \\sim 9 \\).\n   - Again, use the definition \\( a \\sim b = 2a + 4b \\).\n   - Substitute \\( a = 40 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\) into the expression:\n     \\[\n     40 \\sim 9 = 2(40) + 4(9)\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 2(40) = 80 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 4(9) = 36 \\).\n   - Add the results: \\( 80 + 36 = 116 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 40 \\sim 9 = 116 \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe final result of \\( (2 \\sim 9) \\sim 9 \\) is 116.\n\nOutput the answer in the required format:\n\n<<<2, ~, 9, =, 40, ~, 9, =, 116>>>"
