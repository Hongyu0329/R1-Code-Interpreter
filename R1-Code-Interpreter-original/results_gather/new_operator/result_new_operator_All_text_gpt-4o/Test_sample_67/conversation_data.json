    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the expression \\((1 \\sim 10) \\sim 9\\) using the given operation definition. The operation \\(\\sim\\) is defined as \\(a \\sim b = 5 \\times a \\times b\\).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(1 \\sim 10\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(1 \\sim 10 = 5 \\times 1 \\times 10\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\).\n   - Then, \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n   - So, \\(1 \\sim 10 = 50\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((1 \\sim 10) \\sim 9\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(1 \\sim 10 = 50\\).\n   - Now, substitute this result into the expression: \\(50 \\sim 9\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(50 \\sim 9 = 5 \\times 50 \\times 9\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(5 \\times 50 = 250\\).\n   - Then, \\(250 \\times 9 = 2250\\).\n   - So, \\(50 \\sim 9 = 2250\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\((1 \\sim 10) \\sim 9\\) is 2250.\n\nThe answer in the requested format is:\n<<<1, ~, 10, ~, 9, =, 2250>>>"
