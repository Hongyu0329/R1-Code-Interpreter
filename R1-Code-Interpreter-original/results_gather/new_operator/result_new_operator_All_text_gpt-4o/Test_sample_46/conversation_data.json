    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression (3&4)@5%6 using the defined operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate 3&4:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b is 3*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the operation: 3&4 = 3*3*4.\n   - Calculate: 3*3*4 = 36.\n\n2. **Evaluate (3&4)@5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3&4 = 36.\n   - According to the definition, a@b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 36 and b = 5 into the operation: 36@5 = (36 + 5)/5.\n   - Calculate: (36 + 5)/5 = 41/5 = 8.2.\n\n3. **Evaluate ((3&4)@5)%6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3&4)@5 = 8.2.\n   - According to the definition, a%b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 8.2 and b = 6 into the operation: 8.2%6 = (8.2 + 6)/6.\n   - Calculate: (8.2 + 6)/6 = 14.2/6 = 2.366666...\n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<3, &, 4, @, 5, %, 6, =, 2.366666...>>>"
