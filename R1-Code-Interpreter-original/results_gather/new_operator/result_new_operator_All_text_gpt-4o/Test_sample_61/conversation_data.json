    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given operation and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:**\n   - We are given a custom operation defined as \\( a \\sim b = 3a + 3b \\).\n   - This means for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) results in \\( 3a + 3b \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 9 \\sim 4 \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( a = 9 \\) and \\( b = 4 \\) into the operation:\n   \\[\n   9 \\sim 4 = 3 \\times 9 + 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\( 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\)\n     - \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\)\n   - Add the results:\n   \\[\n   27 + 12 = 39\n   \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( 9 \\sim 4 = 39 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\( (9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9 \\):**\n   - We have already found that \\( 9 \\sim 4 = 39 \\).\n   - Now, substitute \\( a = 39 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\) into the operation:\n   \\[\n   39 \\sim 9 = 3 \\times 39 + 3 \\times 9\n   \\]\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\( 3 \\times 39 = 117 \\)\n     - \\( 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\)\n   - Add the results:\n   \\[\n   117 + 27 = 144\n   \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( (9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9 = 144 \\).\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the operation \\( (9 \\sim 4) \\sim 9 \\) is 144.\n\nThe answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<9, ~, 4, =, 39, ~, 9, =, 144>>>"
