    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"&\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"&\":**\n   - The operation a&b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\n2. **Calculate 1&3:**\n   - Substitute a = 1 and b = 3 into the operation:\n     - 1&3 = (1 + 3)/3\n     - Simplify: (1 + 3) = 4\n     - Therefore, 1&3 = 4/3\n\n3. **Calculate (1&3)&3:**\n   - We have already calculated 1&3 = 4/3.\n   - Now, substitute a = 4/3 and b = 3 into the operation:\n     - (4/3)&3 = ((4/3) + 3)/3\n     - Simplify: (4/3) + 3 = 4/3 + 9/3 = 13/3\n     - Therefore, (4/3)&3 = (13/3)/3\n     - Simplify: (13/3)/3 = 13/9\n\n4. **Final answer:**\n   - The final result of (1&3)&3 is 13/9.\n\nThe answer is: <<<1, &, 3, &, 3, =, 13/9>>>"
