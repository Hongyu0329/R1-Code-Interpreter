    "To solve the expression (3$4)%5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3$4:**\n   - According to the definition, a$b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the operation: \n     \\[\n     3\\$4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3$4)%5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3$4 as 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a%b is 4*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 7/4 and b = 5 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     (3\\$4)\\%5 = 4 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 4 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the expression:\n     \\[\n     = 7 + 20 = 27\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate ((3$4)%5)#6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3$4)%5 as 27.\n   - According to the definition, a#b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 27 and b = 6 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     ((3\\$4)\\%5)\\#6 = \\frac{27 + 6}{6} = \\frac{33}{6} = \\frac{11}{2}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, $, 4, %, 5, #, 6, =, 11/2>>>"
