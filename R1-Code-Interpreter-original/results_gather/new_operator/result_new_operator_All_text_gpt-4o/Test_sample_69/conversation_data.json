    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"$\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation \"$\" is defined as \\( a \\$ b = 4 \\times a + 4 \\times b \\).\n\n2. **Calculate 3 $ 7**:\n   - Substitute \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\) into the operation definition:\n   - \\( 3 \\$ 7 = 4 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 7 \\).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\).\n   - \\( 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\).\n\n4. **Add the results**:\n   - \\( 12 + 28 = 40 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate (3 $ 7) $ 1**:\n   - Now, we need to use the result from step 4 as the first operand in a new \"$\" operation with 1 as the second operand.\n   - Substitute \\( a = 40 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\) into the operation definition:\n   - \\( 40 \\$ 1 = 4 \\times 40 + 4 \\times 1 \\).\n\n6. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\).\n   - \\( 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\).\n\n7. **Add the results**:\n   - \\( 160 + 4 = 164 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, $, 7, =, 40, $, 1, =, 164>>>"
