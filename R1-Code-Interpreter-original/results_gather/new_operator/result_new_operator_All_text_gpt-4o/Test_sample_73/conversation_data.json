    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation and the order of operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation $ is defined as a$b = 3 * a * b. This means that for any two numbers a and b, a$b is equal to 3 times the product of a and b.\n\n2. **Identify the expression to evaluate**: We need to calculate (4$6)$4. This expression involves two operations: first, we calculate 4$6, and then we use the result to calculate the second operation with 4.\n\n3. **Calculate 4$6**:\n   - According to the definition, 4$6 = 3 * 4 * 6.\n   - First, calculate the product of 4 and 6: 4 * 6 = 24.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 24 = 72.\n   - So, 4$6 = 72.\n\n4. **Calculate (4$6)$4**:\n   - Now, we need to calculate 72$4 using the result from the previous step.\n   - According to the definition, 72$4 = 3 * 72 * 4.\n   - First, calculate the product of 72 and 4: 72 * 4 = 288.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 288 = 864.\n   - So, (4$6)$4 = 864.\n\n5. **Format the answer**: We need to return the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3, 4, 6, *, 24, *, 72, 4, *, 288, *, 864>>>"
