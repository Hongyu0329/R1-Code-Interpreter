    "To solve the expression (3~4)$5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation `a~b` is defined as \\((a + b)/b\\).\n   - The operation `a$b` is defined as \\(3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - The operation `a#b` is defined as \\((a + b)/b\\).\n\n2. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - Using the definition of `a~b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     3~4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)$5:**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3~4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - Using the definition of `a$b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)$5 = 3 \\times \\frac{7}{4} \\times 5 = \\frac{21 \\times 5}{4} = \\frac{105}{4}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate ((3~4)$5)#6:**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3~4)$5 = \\frac{105}{4}\\).\n   - Using the definition of `a#b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{105}{4}\\right)#6 = \\frac{\\frac{105}{4} + 6}{6}\n     \\]\n   - First, calculate \\(\\frac{105}{4} + 6\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{105}{4} + 6 = \\frac{105}{4} + \\frac{24}{4} = \\frac{129}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Now, calculate \\(\\frac{\\frac{129}{4}}{6}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\frac{129}{4}}{6} = \\frac{129}{4 \\times 6} = \\frac{129}{24}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{129}{24}\\):\n     - The greatest common divisor of 129 and 24 is 3.\n     - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{129}{24} = \\frac{43}{8}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, ~, 4, $, 5, #, 6, =, 43/8>>>"
