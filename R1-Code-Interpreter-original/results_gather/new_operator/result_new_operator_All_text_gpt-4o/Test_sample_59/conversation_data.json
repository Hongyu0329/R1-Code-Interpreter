    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition provided for the operation `%`. According to the problem, the operation `a % b` is defined as `(a + b) / b`. We need to calculate `(4 % 3) % 8` using this definition.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 4 % 3:**\n   - According to the definition, `4 % 3` is calculated as `(4 + 3) / 3`.\n   - Perform the addition: `4 + 3 = 7`.\n   - Divide the result by 3: `7 / 3 = 7/3`.\n\n2. **Calculate (4 % 3) % 8:**\n   - We have already calculated `4 % 3` as `7/3`.\n   - Now, we need to calculate `(7/3) % 8`.\n   - According to the definition, `(7/3) % 8` is calculated as `((7/3) + 8) / 8`.\n   - Perform the addition: `(7/3) + 8 = 7/3 + 24/3 = 31/3`.\n   - Divide the result by 8: `(31/3) / 8 = 31/3 * 1/8 = 31/24`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4, %, 3, =, 7/3, %, 8, =, 31/24>>>"
