    "To solve the expression (3#4)~5&6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the formula: \n     \\[\n     3#4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate 5&6:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b is 1*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 5 and b = 6 into the formula:\n     \\[\n     5&6 = 1 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 30\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3#4)~5:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b is 3*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3#4 (which is 1.75) and b = 5 into the formula:\n     \\[\n     (3#4)~5 = 3 \\times 1.75 + 5 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each part:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 1.75 = 5.25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 5 = 25\n     \\]\n   - Add the results:\n     \\[\n     5.25 + 25 = 30.25\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate (3#4)~5&6:**\n   - Now, we need to evaluate the expression (3#4)~5&6, which is equivalent to (30.25)&6.\n   - Substitute a = 30.25 and b = 6 into the formula for a&b:\n     \\[\n     30.25&6 = 1 \\times 30.25 \\times 6\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the result:\n     \\[\n     30.25 \\times 6 = 181.5\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.75, ~, 5, &, 6, =, 181.5>>>"
