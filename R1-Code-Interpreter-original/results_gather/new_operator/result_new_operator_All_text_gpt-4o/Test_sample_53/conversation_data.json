    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"@\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"@\"**:  \n   The operation a@b is defined as (a + b)/b. This means you add a and b, then divide the result by b.\n\n2. **Calculate 4@9**:  \n   - According to the definition, 4@9 = (4 + 9)/9.\n   - Calculate the sum: 4 + 9 = 13.\n   - Divide the sum by 9: 13/9.\n\n3. **Calculate (4@9)@3**:  \n   - We have already calculated 4@9 as 13/9.\n   - Now, substitute 13/9 for a in the expression (a@b) where b = 3.\n   - So, (4@9)@3 = ((13/9) + 3)/3.\n   - First, calculate (13/9) + 3:\n     - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 9: 3 = 27/9.\n     - Add the fractions: (13/9) + (27/9) = (13 + 27)/9 = 40/9.\n   - Now, divide 40/9 by 3:\n     - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 9: 3 = 27/9.\n     - Divide 40/9 by 27/9: (40/9) / (27/9) = 40/27.\n\n4. **Final result**:  \n   The final result of (4@9)@3 is 40/27.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<4, @, 9, =, 13/9, @, 3, =, 40/27>>>"
