    "To solve the expression (3%4)$5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3%4:**\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 3*a + 3*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3\\%4 = 3*3 + 3*4 = 9 + 12 = 21\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3%4)$5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3%4 = 21.\n   - According to the definition, a$b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 21 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     21\\$5 = (21 + 5)/5 = 26/5 = 5.2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate ((3%4)$5)@6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3%4)$5 = 5.2.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 5*a + 1*b.\n   - Substitute a = 5.2 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     5.2@6 = 5*5.2 + 1*6 = 26 + 6 = 32\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression (3%4)$5@6 is:\n\n<<<3%4, 21, $5, 5.2, @6, 32>>>"
