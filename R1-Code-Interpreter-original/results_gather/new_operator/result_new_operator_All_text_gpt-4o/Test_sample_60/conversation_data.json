    "To solve the expression (3~4)%5$6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 5*a + 3*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     - 3~4 = 5*3 + 3*4 = 15 + 12 = 27.\n\n2. **Calculate (3~4)%5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3~4 = 27.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 3*a + 2*b.\n   - Substitute a = 27 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     - 27%5 = 3*27 + 2*5 = 81 + 10 = 91.\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)%5$6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3~4)%5 = 91.\n   - According to the definition, a$b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 91 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     - 91$6 = (91 + 6)/6 = 97/6.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - 97/6 is the final result of the expression.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, ~, 4, %, 5, $, 6, =, 97/6>>>"
