    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition and the operations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation \"@\" is defined as a@b = 3 * a * b. This means that for any two numbers a and b, a@b is calculated by multiplying a and b together and then multiplying the result by 3.\n\n2. **Calculate 5@2**: \n   - According to the definition, 5@2 = 3 * 5 * 2.\n   - First, multiply 5 and 2: 5 * 2 = 10.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 10 = 30.\n   - So, 5@2 = 30.\n\n3. **Calculate (5@2)@9**:\n   - We have already calculated 5@2 = 30.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 30@9 using the same operation definition.\n   - According to the definition, 30@9 = 3 * 30 * 9.\n   - First, multiply 30 and 9: 30 * 9 = 270.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 270 = 810.\n   - So, (5@2)@9 = 810.\n\n4. **List of values and symbols**:\n   - 5, 2, 3, *, 10, 30, 9, 270, 810\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5, 2, 3, *, 10, 30, 9, 270, 810>>>"
