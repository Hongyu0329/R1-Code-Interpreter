    "To solve the expression (3~4)#5$6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation `a~b` is defined as `1*a*b`.\n   - The operation `a#b` is defined as `(a + b)/b`.\n   - The operation `a$b` is defined as `(a + b)/b`.\n\n2. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - Using the definition of `a~b`, we have `3~4 = 1*3*4`.\n   - Calculate: `1*3*4 = 12`.\n   - So, `3~4 = 12`.\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated `3~4 = 12`.\n   - Now, using the definition of `a#b`, we have `(3~4)#5 = (12 + 5)/5`.\n   - Calculate: `(12 + 5)/5 = 17/5`.\n   - So, `(3~4)#5 = 17/5`.\n\n4. **Calculate ((3~4)#5)$6:**\n   - We have already calculated `(3~4)#5 = 17/5`.\n   - Now, using the definition of `a$b`, we have `((3~4)#5)$6 = ((17/5) + 6)/6`.\n   - Calculate: `((17/5) + 6)/6 = (17/5 + 30/5)/6 = 47/5 / 6`.\n   - Simplify: `47/5 / 6 = 47/30`.\n   - So, `((3~4)#5)$6 = 47/30`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<12, #, 17/5, $, 47/30>>>"
