    "To solve the expression (3~4)%5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 5*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3~4 = 5*3 + 4*4 = 15 + 16 = 31\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3~4)%5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3~4 = 31.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 2*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 31 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     31%5 = 2*31*5 = 310\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate ((3~4)%5)@6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3~4)%5 = 310.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 4*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 310 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     310@6 = 4*310 + 4*6 = 1240 + 24 = 1264\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3~4, 31, %, 5, 310, @, 6, 1264>>>"
