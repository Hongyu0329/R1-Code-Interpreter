    "To solve the expression (3@4)~5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - a@b is defined as 5 * a * b.\n   - a~b is defined as 2 * a + 3 * b.\n   - a#b is defined as 1 * a * b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3@4:**\n   - Using the definition of @, we have:\n     - 3@4 = 5 * 3 * 4\n     - 3@4 = 60\n\n3. **Calculate 5#6:**\n   - Using the definition of #, we have:\n     - 5#6 = 1 * 5 * 6\n     - 5#6 = 30\n\n4. **Calculate (3@4)~5#6:**\n   - We have already calculated 3@4 = 60 and 5#6 = 30.\n   - Now, substitute these values into the expression (3@4)~5#6:\n     - (3@4)~5#6 becomes 60~30.\n   - Using the definition of ~, we have:\n     - 60~30 = 2 * 60 + 3 * 30\n     - 60~30 = 120 + 90\n     - 60~30 = 210\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<60, ~, 30>>>"
