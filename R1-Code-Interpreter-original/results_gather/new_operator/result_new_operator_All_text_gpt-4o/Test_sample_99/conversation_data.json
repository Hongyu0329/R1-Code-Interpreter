    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the operations defined by the custom operator \"$\". Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Custom Operator \"$\":**\n   - The operation a$b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\n2. **Calculate 10$3:**\n   - Substitute a = 10 and b = 3 into the definition of the operator:\n     - 10$3 = (10 + 3)/3\n     - 10$3 = 13/3\n\n3. **Calculate (10$3)$8:**\n   - Now, we need to use the result from the previous step as the first operand in the next operation:\n   - Substitute a = 13/3 and b = 8 into the definition of the operator:\n     - (13/3)$8 = ((13/3) + 8)/8\n     - First, calculate (13/3) + 8:\n       - Convert 8 to a fraction with a denominator of 3: 8 = 24/3\n       - (13/3) + (24/3) = (13 + 24)/3 = 37/3\n     - Now, divide by 8:\n       - (37/3)/8 = 37/(3*8) = 37/24\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The result of (10$3)$8 is 37/24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10, $, 3, ), $, 8, =, 37/24>>>"
