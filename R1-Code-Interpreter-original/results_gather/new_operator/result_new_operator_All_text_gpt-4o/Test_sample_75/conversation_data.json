    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"@\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"@\"**:  \n   The operation \"a@b\" is defined as \\(2 \\times a + 4 \\times b\\).\n\n2. **Calculate 1@4**:  \n   - Substitute \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 4\\) into the operation:\n   - \\(1@4 = 2 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 4\\)\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\n   - Add the results:\n     - \\(2 + 16 = 18\\)\n   - Therefore, \\(1@4 = 18\\).\n\n3. **Calculate (1@4)@2**:  \n   - We have already calculated \\(1@4 = 18\\).\n   - Now substitute \\(a = 18\\) and \\(b = 2\\) into the operation:\n   - \\((1@4)@2 = 18@2 = 2 \\times 18 + 4 \\times 2\\)\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\(2 \\times 18 = 36\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)\n   - Add the results:\n     - \\(36 + 8 = 44\\)\n   - Therefore, \\((1@4)@2 = 44\\).\n\nThe final answer is:  \n<<<1, @, 4, =, 18, @, 2, =, 44>>>"
