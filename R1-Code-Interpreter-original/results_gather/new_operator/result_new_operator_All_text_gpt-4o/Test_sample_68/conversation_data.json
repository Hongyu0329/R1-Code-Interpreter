    "To solve the expression (3@4)&5#6, we need to evaluate it step by step using the given operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate 3@4:**\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 4*a + 2*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3@4 = 4*3 + 2*4 = 12 + 8 = 20\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate (3@4)&5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3@4 = 20.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 20 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     20&5 = (20 + 5)/5 = 25/5 = 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate 5#6:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 5 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     5#6 = (5 + 6)/6 = 11/6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - We have (3@4)&5 = 5 and 5#6 = 11/6.\n   - The final expression is 5#6, which we have already calculated as 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<11/6>>>"
