    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the steps and apply the given definition of the operation `%`. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation `%`:**  \n   According to the problem, for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\% b \\) is defined as \\( 2 \\times a + 2 \\times b \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 6 \\% 9 \\):**  \n   - Here, \\( a = 6 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\).\n   - Apply the definition:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\% 9 = 2 \\times 6 + 2 \\times 9\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the individual terms:  \n     \\[\n     2 \\times 6 = 12\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 9 = 18\n     \\]\n   - Add the results:  \n     \\[\n     12 + 18 = 30\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( 6 \\% 9 = 30 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\( 30 \\% 5 \\):**  \n   - Now, \\( a = 30 \\) and \\( b = 5 \\).\n   - Apply the definition again:  \n     \\[\n     30 \\% 5 = 2 \\times 30 + 2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the individual terms:  \n     \\[\n     2 \\times 30 = 60\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 5 = 10\n     \\]\n   - Add the results:  \n     \\[\n     60 + 10 = 70\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( 30 \\% 5 = 70 \\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**  \n   The final result of the expression \\( (6 \\% 9) \\% 5 \\) is 70.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<6, %, 9, =, 30, %, 5, =, 70>>>"
