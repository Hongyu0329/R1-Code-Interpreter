    "To solve the expression (3#4)~5%6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation a#b is defined as 4 * a * b.\n   - The operation a~b is defined as 3 * a + 5 * b.\n   - The operation a%b is defined as 4 * a * b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - Using the definition of #, we have:\n     - 3#4 = 4 * 3 * 4 = 48.\n\n3. **Calculate 5%6:**\n   - Using the definition of %, we have:\n     - 5%6 = 4 * 5 * 6 = 120.\n\n4. **Calculate (3#4)~5%6:**\n   - Now we need to calculate 48~120 using the definition of ~:\n     - 48~120 = 3 * 48 + 5 * 120.\n     - Calculate 3 * 48 = 144.\n     - Calculate 5 * 120 = 600.\n     - Add the results: 144 + 600 = 744.\n\n5. **Final answer:**\n   - The expression (3#4)~5%6 evaluates to 744.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<3#4, 5%6, 48~120, 744>>>"
