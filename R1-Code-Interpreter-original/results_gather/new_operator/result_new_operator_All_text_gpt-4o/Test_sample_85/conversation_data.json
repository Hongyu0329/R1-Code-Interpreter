    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"&\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"&\":**\n   - The operation a&b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\n2. **Calculate 7&5:**\n   - According to the definition, 7&5 = (7 + 5)/5.\n   - Calculate the sum: 7 + 5 = 12.\n   - Divide the sum by 5: 12/5 = 2.4.\n\n3. **Use the result from step 2 to calculate (7&5)&4:**\n   - We found that 7&5 = 2.4.\n   - Now, calculate 2.4&4 using the definition: (2.4 + 4)/4.\n   - Calculate the sum: 2.4 + 4 = 6.4.\n   - Divide the sum by 4: 6.4/4 = 1.6.\n\n4. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of (7&5)&4 is 1.6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<7 + 5, 12/5, 2.4 + 4, 6.4/4, 1.6>>>"
