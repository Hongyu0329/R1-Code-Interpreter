    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the operations as defined and calculate the result step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation `a&b` is defined as `2*a*b`. This means for any two numbers `a` and `b`, `a&b` is calculated by multiplying `a` and `b` together and then multiplying the result by 2.\n\n2. **Calculate 1&7**:\n   - Here, `a = 1` and `b = 7`.\n   - According to the operation, `1&7 = 2*1*7`.\n   - Calculate `1*7 = 7`.\n   - Then, multiply by 2: `2*7 = 14`.\n   - So, `1&7 = 14`.\n\n3. **Calculate (1&7)&4**:\n   - Now, we need to calculate `(1&7)&4`.\n   - We already found that `1&7 = 14`.\n   - So, we need to calculate `14&4`.\n   - Here, `a = 14` and `b = 4`.\n   - According to the operation, `14&4 = 2*14*4`.\n   - Calculate `14*4 = 56`.\n   - Then, multiply by 2: `2*56 = 112`.\n   - So, `14&4 = 112`.\n\n4. **Final result**:\n   - The final result of `(1&7)&4` is `112`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<1&7 = 14, 14&4 = 112>>>"
