    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"&\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"&\":**\n   - The operation a&b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\n2. **Calculate 7&8:**\n   - According to the definition, 7&8 = (7 + 8)/8.\n   - Calculate the sum: 7 + 8 = 15.\n   - Divide by 8: 15/8 = 1.875.\n\n3. **Use the result from step 2 to calculate (7&8)&3:**\n   - We found that 7&8 = 1.875.\n   - Now, calculate 1.875&3 using the definition: (1.875 + 3)/3.\n   - Calculate the sum: 1.875 + 3 = 4.875.\n   - Divide by 3: 4.875/3 = 1.625.\n\n4. **Final answer:**\n   - The result of (7&8)&3 is 1.625.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<7 + 8, 15/8, 1.875 + 3, 4.875/3, 1.625>>>"
