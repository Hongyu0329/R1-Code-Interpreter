    "To solve the expression (3#4)~5$6, we need to break it down step by step using the defined operations. Let's analyze each part carefully:\n\n1. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the operation: \n     \\[\n     3#4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate 5$6:**\n   - According to the definition, a$b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 5 and b = 6 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     5$6 = \\frac{5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{11}{6}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3#4)~5$6:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 = 7/4 and 5$6 = 11/6.\n   - Now, we need to calculate (7/4)~(11/6).\n   - According to the definition, a~b is 4*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 7/4 and b = 11/6 into the operation:\n     \\[\n     (7/4)~(11/6) = 4 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 5 \\times \\frac{11}{6}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the expression:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times \\frac{7}{4} = 7\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     5 \\times \\frac{11}{6} = \\frac{55}{6}\n     \\]\n   - Add the two results:\n     \\[\n     7 + \\frac{55}{6} = \\frac{42}{6} + \\frac{55}{6} = \\frac{97}{6}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7/4, ~, 11/6, =, 97/6>>>"
