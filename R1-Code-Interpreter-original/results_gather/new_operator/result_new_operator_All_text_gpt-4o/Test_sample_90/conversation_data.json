    "To solve the expression (3%4)$5~6 using the defined operations, we need to evaluate it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate 3%4:**\n   - According to the definition, a%b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Evaluate (3%4)$5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3%4 as 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a$b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 7/4 and b = 5 into the expression: (7/4 + 5)/5.\n   - First, calculate 7/4 + 5. Convert 5 to a fraction with a denominator of 4: 5 = 20/4.\n   - Add the fractions: 7/4 + 20/4 = 27/4.\n   - Now, divide by 5: (27/4)/5 = 27/20.\n\n3. **Evaluate ((3%4)$5)~6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3%4)$5 as 27/20.\n   - According to the definition, a~b is 1*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 27/20 and b = 6 into the expression: 1*(27/20) + 5*6.\n   - Calculate 1*(27/20) = 27/20.\n   - Calculate 5*6 = 30.\n   - Add the results: 27/20 + 30.\n   - Convert 30 to a fraction with a denominator of 20: 30 = 600/20.\n   - Add the fractions: 27/20 + 600/20 = 627/20.\n\nThe final result of the expression (3%4)$5~6 is 627/20.\n\nAnswer: <<<3%4, 7/4, $5, 27/20, ~6, 627/20>>>"
