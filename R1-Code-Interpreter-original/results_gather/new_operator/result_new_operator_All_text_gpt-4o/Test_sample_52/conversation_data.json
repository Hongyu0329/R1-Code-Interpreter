    "To solve the expression (3@4)%5&6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3@4:**\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 5*a + 2*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3@4 = 5*3 + 2*4 = 15 + 8 = 23\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3@4)%5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3@4 = 23.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 4*a + 1*b.\n   - Substitute a = 23 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     23%5 = 4*23 + 1*5 = 92 + 5 = 97\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate ((3@4)%5)&6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3@4)%5 = 97.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 97 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     97&6 = (97 + 6)/6 = 103/6 \\approx 17.1667\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, @, 4, %, 5, &, 6, =, 17.1667>>>"
