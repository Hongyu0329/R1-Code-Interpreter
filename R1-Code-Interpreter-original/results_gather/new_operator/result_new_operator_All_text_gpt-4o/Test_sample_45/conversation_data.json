    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given operation and perform the calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: We are given a custom operation defined as \\( a \\sim b = 3 \\times a \\times b \\). This means that for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the operation \\( a \\sim b \\) results in multiplying \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) together and then multiplying the result by 3.\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 10 \\sim 10 \\)**:\n   - Substitute \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 10 \\) into the operation.\n   - \\( 10 \\sim 10 = 3 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\).\n   - Then, calculate \\( 3 \\times 100 = 300 \\).\n   - So, \\( 10 \\sim 10 = 300 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\( (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 \\)**:\n   - We have already calculated \\( 10 \\sim 10 = 300 \\).\n   - Now, substitute \\( a = 300 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\) into the operation.\n   - \\( 300 \\sim 3 = 3 \\times 300 \\times 3 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 300 \\times 3 = 900 \\).\n   - Then, calculate \\( 3 \\times 900 = 2700 \\).\n   - So, \\( (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 = 2700 \\).\n\n4. **Final answer**: The final result of the operation \\( (10 \\sim 10) \\sim 3 \\) is 2700.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<10, ~, 10, =, 300, ~, 3, =, 2700>>>"
