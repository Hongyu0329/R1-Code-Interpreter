    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the operations defined by the custom operator \"$\". Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the custom operation**: \n   - The operation a$b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\n2. **Calculate the first operation (3$10)**:\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 10 into the operation a$b.\n   - (3$10) = (3 + 10)/10 = 13/10.\n\n3. **Use the result of the first operation in the second operation ((3$10)$7)**:\n   - Now, we need to calculate (13/10)$7.\n   - Substitute a = 13/10 and b = 7 into the operation a$b.\n   - ((13/10)$7) = ((13/10) + 7)/7.\n\n4. **Simplify the expression ((13/10) + 7)/7**:\n   - First, calculate (13/10) + 7.\n   - Convert 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 10: 7 = 70/10.\n   - Add the fractions: (13/10) + (70/10) = (13 + 70)/10 = 83/10.\n   - Now, divide by 7: (83/10)/7 = 83/(10*7) = 83/70.\n\n5. **Final result**:\n   - The result of the operation ((3$10)$7) is 83/70.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<3, $, 10, ), $, 7, =, 83/70>>>"
