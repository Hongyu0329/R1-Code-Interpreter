    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition and perform the operations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation $ is defined as a$b = 3 * a * b. This means that for any two numbers a and b, a$b is calculated by multiplying a and b together and then multiplying the result by 3.\n\n2. **Calculate 7$5**: \n   - According to the definition, 7$5 = 3 * 7 * 5.\n   - First, calculate 7 * 5 = 35.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 35 = 105.\n   - So, 7$5 = 105.\n\n3. **Calculate (7$5)$7**:\n   - We have already calculated 7$5 = 105.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 105$7.\n   - According to the definition, 105$7 = 3 * 105 * 7.\n   - First, calculate 105 * 7 = 735.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: 3 * 735 = 2205.\n   - So, (7$5)$7 = 2205.\n\n4. **Format the answer**: We need to return the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<7, $, 5, =, 105, $, 7, =, 2205>>>"
