    "To solve the expression (3&4)#5~6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3&4:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b = 4*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3&4 = 4*3*4 = 48\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3&4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3&4 = 48.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 2*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 48 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     48#5 = 2*48*5 = 480\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3&4)#5~6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3&4)#5 = 480.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 4*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 480 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     480~6 = 4*480 + 5*6 = 1920 + 30 = 1950\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, &, 4, #, 5, ~, 6, =, 1950>>>"
