    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"$\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"$\":**\n   - The operation a$b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3$4:**\n   - According to the definition, 3$4 = (3 + 4)/4.\n   - Calculate the sum: 3 + 4 = 7.\n   - Divide by 4: 7/4 = 1.75.\n\n3. **Use the result from step 2 to calculate (3$4)$10:**\n   - We found that 3$4 = 1.75.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 1.75$10.\n   - According to the definition, 1.75$10 = (1.75 + 10)/10.\n   - Calculate the sum: 1.75 + 10 = 11.75.\n   - Divide by 10: 11.75/10 = 1.175.\n\n4. **Final answer:**\n   - The result of (3$4)$10 is 1.175.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<3, $, 4, ), $, 10, =, 1.175>>>"
