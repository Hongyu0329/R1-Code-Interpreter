    "To solve the expression (3#4)~5$6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation a#b is defined as 1*a + 5*b.\n   - The operation a~b is defined as 5*a*b.\n   - The operation a$b is defined as 1*a*b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - Using the definition of #, we have:\n     - 3#4 = 1*3 + 5*4\n     - = 3 + 20\n     - = 23\n\n3. **Calculate 5$6:**\n   - Using the definition of $, we have:\n     - 5$6 = 1*5*6\n     - = 30\n\n4. **Calculate (3#4)~5$6:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 = 23 and 5$6 = 30.\n   - Now, substitute these values into the expression (3#4)~5$6:\n     - (3#4)~5$6 = 23~30\n   - Using the definition of ~, we have:\n     - 23~30 = 5*23*30\n     - = 5*690\n     - = 3450\n\n5. **Final answer:**\n   - The expression (3#4)~5$6 evaluates to 3450.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<23, ~, 30>>>"
