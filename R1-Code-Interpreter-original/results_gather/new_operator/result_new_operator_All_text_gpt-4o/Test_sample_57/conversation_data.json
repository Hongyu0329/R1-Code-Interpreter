    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the expression and apply the given operation step by step. The operation defined is a@b = 4*a + 3*b. We need to calculate (2@2)@3.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: \n   - The operation a@b is defined as 4*a + 3*b.\n\n2. **Calculate 2@2**:\n   - Substitute a = 2 and b = 2 into the operation:\n   - 2@2 = 4*2 + 3*2\n   - Calculate 4*2 = 8\n   - Calculate 3*2 = 6\n   - Add the results: 8 + 6 = 14\n   - Therefore, 2@2 = 14\n\n3. **Calculate (2@2)@3**:\n   - We have already calculated 2@2 = 14.\n   - Now substitute a = 14 and b = 3 into the operation:\n   - (2@2)@3 = 14@3 = 4*14 + 3*3\n   - Calculate 4*14 = 56\n   - Calculate 3*3 = 9\n   - Add the results: 56 + 9 = 65\n   - Therefore, (2@2)@3 = 65\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe final answer, with the list of values and symbols used in the calculation, is:\n\n<<<2, @, 2, =, 14, @, 3, =, 65>>>"
