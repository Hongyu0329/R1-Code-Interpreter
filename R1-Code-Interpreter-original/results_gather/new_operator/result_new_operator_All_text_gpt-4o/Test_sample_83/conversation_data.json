    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given operation and apply it step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the operation definition:**\n   - We are given that \\( a \\sim b \\) is defined as \\( 1 \\times a \\times b \\).\n   - This means that for any two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( a \\sim b = a \\times b \\).\n\n2. **Break down the expression \\((6 \\sim 1) \\sim 6\\):**\n   - We need to evaluate the expression step by step, starting from the innermost operation.\n\n3. **Calculate \\( 6 \\sim 1 \\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\( 6 \\sim 1 = 1 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\).\n   - Simplifying this, we get \\( 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - Now that we have \\( 6 \\sim 1 = 6 \\), we substitute this into the outer operation: \\((6 \\sim 1) \\sim 6\\) becomes \\( 6 \\sim 6 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\( 6 \\sim 6 \\):**\n   - Again, using the definition, \\( 6 \\sim 6 = 1 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\).\n   - Simplifying this, we get \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\).\n\n6. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\((6 \\sim 1) \\sim 6\\) is 36.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<6, ~, 1, ~, 6, =, 36>>>"
