    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"@\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"@\"**: \n   - The operation \"a@b\" is defined as (a + b) / b.\n\n2. **Calculate 5@2**:\n   - Substitute a = 5 and b = 2 into the operation definition.\n   - 5@2 = (5 + 2) / 2\n   - Calculate the expression: (5 + 2) = 7\n   - Divide by 2: 7 / 2 = 3.5\n\n3. **Use the result of 5@2 to calculate (5@2)@6**:\n   - We found that 5@2 = 3.5.\n   - Now, substitute a = 3.5 and b = 6 into the operation definition.\n   - (5@2)@6 = (3.5 + 6) / 6\n   - Calculate the expression: (3.5 + 6) = 9.5\n   - Divide by 6: 9.5 / 6 = 1.5833 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\n4. **Format the answer**:\n   - List the values and symbols used in the calculation: 5, @, 2, @, 6, =, 1.5833\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<5, @, 2, @, 6, =, 1.5833>>>"
