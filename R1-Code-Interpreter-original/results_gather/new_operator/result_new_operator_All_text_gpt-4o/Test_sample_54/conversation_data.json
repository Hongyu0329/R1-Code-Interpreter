    "To solve the expression (3~4)%5$6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Calculate (3~4)%5:**\n   - We already calculated 3~4 as 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a%b is (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 7/4 and b = 5 into the expression: (7/4 + 5)/5.\n   - First, calculate 7/4 + 5:\n     - Convert 5 to a fraction with a denominator of 4: 5 = 20/4.\n     - Add the fractions: 7/4 + 20/4 = 27/4.\n   - Now, divide by 5: (27/4)/5 = 27/20.\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)%5$6:**\n   - We already calculated (3~4)%5 as 27/20.\n   - According to the definition, a$b is 2*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 27/20 and b = 6 into the expression: 2*(27/20) + 4*6.\n   - First, calculate 2*(27/20):\n     - 2*(27/20) = 54/20 = 27/10.\n   - Next, calculate 4*6:\n     - 4*6 = 24.\n   - Add the results: 27/10 + 24.\n   - Convert 24 to a fraction with a denominator of 10: 24 = 240/10.\n   - Add the fractions: 27/10 + 240/10 = 267/10.\n\nThe final answer is 267/10.\n\nOutput the answer in the specified format:\n<<<3, ~, 4, %, 5, $, 6, =, 267/10>>>"
