    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"&\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"&\":**\n   - The operation a&b is defined as 2 * a * b.\n\n2. **Calculate 4&4:**\n   - According to the definition, 4&4 = 2 * 4 * 4.\n   - Calculate 2 * 4 = 8.\n   - Then, calculate 8 * 4 = 32.\n   - So, 4&4 = 32.\n\n3. **Calculate (4&4)&4:**\n   - We have already calculated 4&4 = 32.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 32&4.\n   - According to the definition, 32&4 = 2 * 32 * 4.\n   - Calculate 2 * 32 = 64.\n   - Then, calculate 64 * 4 = 256.\n   - So, (4&4)&4 = 256.\n\n4. **List of values and symbols:**\n   - Start with 4&4: 2 * 4 * 4 = 32.\n   - Then, (4&4)&4: 2 * 32 * 4 = 256.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2, *, 4, *, 4, =, 32, &, 4, =, 2, *, 32, *, 4, =, 256>>>"
