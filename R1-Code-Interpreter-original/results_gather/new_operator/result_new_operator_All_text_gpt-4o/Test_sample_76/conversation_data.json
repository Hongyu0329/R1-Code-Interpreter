    "To solve the expression (3$4)@5%6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3$4:**\n   - According to the definition, a$b = 3*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     - 3$4 = 3*3 + 5*4\n     - = 9 + 20\n     - = 29\n\n2. **Calculate (3$4)@5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3$4 = 29.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 5*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 29 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     - 29@5 = 5*29 + 4*5\n     - = 145 + 20\n     - = 165\n\n3. **Calculate ((3$4)@5)%6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3$4)@5 = 165.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 4*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 165 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     - 165%6 = 4*165*6\n     - = 3960\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3$4, 29, @5, 165, %6, 3960>>>"
