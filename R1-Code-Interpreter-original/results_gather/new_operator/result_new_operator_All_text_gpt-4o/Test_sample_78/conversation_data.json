    "To solve the expression (3~4)$5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation `a~b` is defined as \\(3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - The operation `a$b` is defined as \\(3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - The operation `a@b` is defined as \\((a + b) / b\\).\n\n2. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - Using the definition of `a~b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     3~4 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 36\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)$5:**\n   - We already found that \\(3~4 = 36\\).\n   - Now, using the definition of `a$b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     36\\$5 = 3 \\times 36 \\times 5 = 540\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate (3~4)$5@6:**\n   - We already found that \\((3~4)\\$5 = 540\\).\n   - Now, using the definition of `a@b`, we have:\n     \\[\n     540@6 = \\frac{540 + 6}{6} = \\frac{546}{6} = 91\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final answer:**\n   - The expression (3~4)$5@6 evaluates to 91.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<3, ~, 4, $, 5, @, 6, =, 91>>>"
