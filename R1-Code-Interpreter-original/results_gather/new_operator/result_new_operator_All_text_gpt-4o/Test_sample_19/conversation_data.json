    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the expression and apply the given operation step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation \"@\" is defined as \\( a@b = 2a + 2b \\).\n\n2. **Identify the expression to evaluate**: We need to calculate \\((9@4)@4\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the inner operation**: \n   - First, evaluate \\(9@4\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(9@4 = 2 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\).\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\).\n   - Add the results: \\(18 + 8 = 26\\).\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression**: \n   - Now, we need to evaluate \\(26@4\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the outer operation**:\n   - According to the definition, \\(26@4 = 2 \\times 26 + 2 \\times 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 26 = 52\\).\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\).\n   - Add the results: \\(52 + 8 = 60\\).\n\n6. **Final result**: The result of \\((9@4)@4\\) is 60.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<9, @, 4, =, 26, @, 4, =, 60>>>"
