    "To solve the expression (3~4)#5&6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 4*a + 5*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     - 3~4 = 4*3 + 5*4 = 12 + 20 = 32.\n\n2. **Calculate (3~4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3~4 = 32.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 32 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     - (3~4)#5 = (32 + 5)/5 = 37/5 = 7.4.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3~4)#5)&6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3~4)#5 = 7.4.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = 1*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 7.4 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     - ((3~4)#5)&6 = 1*7.4*6 = 44.4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3~4, 32, #5, 7.4, &6, 44.4>>>"
