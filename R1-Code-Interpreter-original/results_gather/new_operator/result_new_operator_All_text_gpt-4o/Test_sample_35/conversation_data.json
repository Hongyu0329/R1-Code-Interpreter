    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the expression and apply the given operation step by step. The operation defined is a#b = 3*a + 5*b. We need to calculate (3#2)#5.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the operation a#b:**\n   - The operation a#b is defined as 3*a + 5*b.\n   - This means for any two numbers a and b, you multiply a by 3 and b by 5, then add the results.\n\n2. **Calculate 3#2:**\n   - Here, a = 3 and b = 2.\n   - Apply the operation: 3#2 = 3*3 + 5*2.\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - 3*3 = 9\n     - 5*2 = 10\n   - Add the results: 9 + 10 = 19.\n   - Therefore, 3#2 = 19.\n\n3. **Calculate (3#2)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#2 = 19.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 19#5.\n   - Here, a = 19 and b = 5.\n   - Apply the operation: 19#5 = 3*19 + 5*5.\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - 3*19 = 57\n     - 5*5 = 25\n   - Add the results: 57 + 25 = 82.\n   - Therefore, 19#5 = 82.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of (3#2)#5 is 82.\n\nOutput the answer in the required format:\n<<<3, #, 2, =, 19, #, 5, =, 82>>>"
