    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the expression and apply the given operation step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation a@b is defined as 2*a + 5*b. This means for any two numbers a and b, you multiply a by 2 and b by 5, then add the results together.\n\n2. **Calculate 2@4**:\n   - Here, a = 2 and b = 4.\n   - Apply the operation: 2*2 + 5*4.\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - 2*2 = 4\n     - 5*4 = 20\n   - Add the results: 4 + 20 = 24.\n   - So, 2@4 = 24.\n\n3. **Calculate (2@4)@4**:\n   - We have already calculated 2@4 = 24.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 24@4.\n   - Here, a = 24 and b = 4.\n   - Apply the operation: 2*24 + 5*4.\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - 2*24 = 48\n     - 5*4 = 20\n   - Add the results: 48 + 20 = 68.\n   - So, (2@4)@4 = 68.\n\n4. **Final answer**: The final result of the expression (2@4)@4 is 68.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<2, @, 4, =, 24, @, 4, =, 68>>>"
