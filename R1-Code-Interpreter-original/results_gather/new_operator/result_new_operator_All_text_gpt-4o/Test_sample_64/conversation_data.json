    "To solve the expression (3#4)@5&6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 1*a + 4*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3#4 = 1*3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3#4)@5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 = 19.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 19 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     19@5 = (19 + 5)/5 = 24/5 = 4.8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate ((3#4)@5)&6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3#4)@5 = 4.8.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 4.8 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     4.8&6 = (4.8 + 6)/6 = 10.8/6 = 1.8\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression (3#4)@5&6 is:\n\n<<<19, @, 5, &, 6, =, 1.8>>>"
