    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given operation and apply it step by step. The operation defined is \\( a \\sim b = 2 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\nWe are tasked with calculating \\((1 \\sim 9) \\sim 1\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(1 \\sim 9\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(1 \\sim 9 = 2 \\times 1 \\times 9\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n   - Then, \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(1 \\sim 9 = 18\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((1 \\sim 9) \\sim 1\\):**\n   - We have already found that \\(1 \\sim 9 = 18\\).\n   - Now, calculate \\(18 \\sim 1\\) using the same operation definition.\n   - According to the definition, \\(18 \\sim 1 = 2 \\times 18 \\times 1\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(2 \\times 18 = 36\\).\n   - Then, \\(36 \\times 1 = 36\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(18 \\sim 1 = 36\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe final result of \\((1 \\sim 9) \\sim 1\\) is 36.\n\nOutput the answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<1, ~, 9, ~, 1, =, 36>>>"
