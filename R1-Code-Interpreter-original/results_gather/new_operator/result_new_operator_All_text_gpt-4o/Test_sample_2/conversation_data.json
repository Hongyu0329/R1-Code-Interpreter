    "To solve the expression (3&4)~5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation `a&b` is defined as \\(1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - The operation `a~b` is defined as \\(3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - The operation `a@b` is defined as \\(2 \\times a + 2 \\times b\\).\n\n2. **Calculate 3&4:**\n   - Using the definition of `&`, we have:\n     \\[\n     3&4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3&4)~5:**\n   - Substitute the result from step 2 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     12~5 = 3 \\times 12 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the result:\n     \\[\n     12~5 = 3 \\times 12 \\times 5 = 180\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate (3&4)~5@6:**\n   - Substitute the result from step 3 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     180@6 = 2 \\times 180 + 2 \\times 6\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the result:\n     \\[\n     180@6 = 360 + 12 = 372\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final answer:**\n   - The expression (3&4)~5@6 evaluates to 372.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3, &, 4, ~, 5, @, 6, =, 372>>>"
