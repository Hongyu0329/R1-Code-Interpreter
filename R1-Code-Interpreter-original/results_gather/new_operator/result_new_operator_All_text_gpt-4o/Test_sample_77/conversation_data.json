    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"@\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"@\"**:  \n   The operation \"a@b\" is defined as (a + b) / b.\n\n2. **Calculate 4@4**:  \n   - Substitute a = 4 and b = 4 into the operation:  \n     (4 + 4) / 4  \n   - Perform the addition:  \n     8 / 4  \n   - Perform the division:  \n     2\n\n3. **Use the result of 4@4 to calculate (4@4)@7**:  \n   - We found that 4@4 = 2. Now we need to calculate 2@7.  \n   - Substitute a = 2 and b = 7 into the operation:  \n     (2 + 7) / 7  \n   - Perform the addition:  \n     9 / 7  \n   - Perform the division:  \n     9/7\n\n4. **Final result**:  \n   The final result of (4@4)@7 is 9/7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:  \n<<<(4 + 4) / 4 = 2, (2 + 7) / 7 = 9/7>>>"
