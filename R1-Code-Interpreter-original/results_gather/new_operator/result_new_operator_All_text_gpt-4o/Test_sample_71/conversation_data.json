    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation and the order of operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation a#b is defined as 4 * a * b. This means for any two numbers a and b, a#b is calculated by multiplying a and b together and then multiplying the result by 4.\n\n2. **Calculate 6#4**: \n   - According to the definition, 6#4 = 4 * 6 * 4.\n   - First, calculate 6 * 4 = 24.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 4: 4 * 24 = 96.\n   - So, 6#4 = 96.\n\n3. **Calculate (6#4)#2**:\n   - We have already calculated 6#4 = 96.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 96#2 using the same operation definition.\n   - According to the definition, 96#2 = 4 * 96 * 2.\n   - First, calculate 96 * 2 = 192.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 4: 4 * 192 = 768.\n   - So, (6#4)#2 = 768.\n\n4. **Format the answer**: We need to return the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6, #, 4, #, 2, =, 768>>>"
