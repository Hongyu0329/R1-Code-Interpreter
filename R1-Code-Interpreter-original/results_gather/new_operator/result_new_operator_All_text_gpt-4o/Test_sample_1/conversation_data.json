    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the steps and apply the given operation. The operation defined is a&b = 4*a + 2*b. We need to calculate (5&3)&6.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Calculate 5&3:**\n   - According to the operation a&b = 4*a + 2*b, substitute a = 5 and b = 3.\n   - Compute: 4*5 + 2*3\n   - Calculate: 20 + 6 = 26\n   - Therefore, 5&3 = 26.\n\n2. **Calculate (5&3)&6:**\n   - We have already calculated 5&3 = 26.\n   - Now, substitute a = 26 and b = 6 into the operation a&b = 4*a + 2*b.\n   - Compute: 4*26 + 2*6\n   - Calculate: 104 + 12 = 116\n   - Therefore, (5&3)&6 = 116.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer, with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, is:\n\n<<<5, &, 3, =, 26, &, 6, =, 116>>>"
