    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition and the operations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation \"@\" is defined as \\( a@b = 3 \\times a \\times b \\).\n\n2. **Calculate 8@10**:\n   - Substitute \\( a = 8 \\) and \\( b = 10 \\) into the definition of the operation.\n   - \\( 8@10 = 3 \\times 8 \\times 10 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\).\n   - Then calculate \\( 24 \\times 10 = 240 \\).\n   - So, \\( 8@10 = 240 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate (8@10)@2**:\n   - We have already calculated \\( 8@10 = 240 \\).\n   - Now substitute \\( a = 240 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\) into the definition of the operation.\n   - \\( 240@2 = 3 \\times 240 \\times 2 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 3 \\times 240 = 720 \\).\n   - Then calculate \\( 720 \\times 2 = 1440 \\).\n   - So, \\( (8@10)@2 = 1440 \\).\n\n4. **Final answer**: The final result of the operation is 1440.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<8, @, 10, =, 240, @, 2, =, 1440>>>"
