    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation \"$\" and apply it step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operation \"$\":**\n   - The operation a$b is defined as 3*a + 3*b.\n\n2. **Calculate 5$9:**\n   - According to the definition, 5$9 = 3*5 + 3*9.\n   - Calculate 3*5 = 15.\n   - Calculate 3*9 = 27.\n   - Add the results: 15 + 27 = 42.\n   - Therefore, 5$9 = 42.\n\n3. **Calculate (5$9)$4:**\n   - We have already calculated 5$9 = 42.\n   - Now, we need to calculate 42$4 using the same operation definition.\n   - According to the definition, 42$4 = 3*42 + 3*4.\n   - Calculate 3*42 = 126.\n   - Calculate 3*4 = 12.\n   - Add the results: 126 + 12 = 138.\n   - Therefore, (5$9)$4 = 138.\n\n4. **Format the answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5, $, 9, =, 42, $, 4, =, 138>>>"
