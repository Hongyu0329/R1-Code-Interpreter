    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully follow the definition of the operation and the order of operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The operation a#b is defined as 3 * a * b. This means that for any two numbers a and b, a#b is calculated by multiplying a and b together and then multiplying the result by 3.\n\n2. **Identify the expression to evaluate**: We need to calculate (9#7)#2. This expression involves two operations of the form a#b.\n\n3. **Evaluate the inner operation first**: According to the order of operations (parentheses first), we need to evaluate 9#7 before applying the operation with 2.\n\n   - **Calculate 9#7**: \n     - Substitute a = 9 and b = 7 into the definition of a#b.\n     - 9#7 = 3 * 9 * 7.\n     - Calculate the multiplication: 3 * 9 = 27.\n     - Then multiply the result by 7: 27 * 7 = 189.\n\n4. **Use the result of the inner operation**: Now that we have 9#7 = 189, we substitute this result into the outer operation.\n\n5. **Evaluate the outer operation**: Now we need to calculate 189#2.\n\n   - **Calculate 189#2**:\n     - Substitute a = 189 and b = 2 into the definition of a#b.\n     - 189#2 = 3 * 189 * 2.\n     - Calculate the multiplication: 3 * 189 = 567.\n     - Then multiply the result by 2: 567 * 2 = 1134.\n\n6. **Final result**: The result of (9#7)#2 is 1134.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9, #, 7, =, 189, #, 2, =, 1134>>>"
