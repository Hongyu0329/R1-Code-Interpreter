    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(3\\#4 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = 24\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 24\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(24\\&5 = 3 \\times 24 \\times 5 = 360\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 360\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 4 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 360\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(360@6 = 4 \\times 360 \\times 6 = 8640\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, #, 4, &, 5, @, 6, =, 8640>>>"
