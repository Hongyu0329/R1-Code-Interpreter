    "To solve the expression (3&4)~5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3&4:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b = 3*a + 2*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     \\[\n     3&4 = 3*3 + 2*4 = 9 + 8 = 17\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate (3&4)~5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3&4 = 17.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 4*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 17 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     17~5 = 4*17*5 = 340\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate (3&4)~5@6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3&4)~5 = 340.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = (a + b)/b.\n   - Substitute a = 340 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     \\[\n     340@6 = (340 + 6)/6 = 346/6 = 57.6667\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3&4, 17, ~5, 340, @6, 57.6667>>>"
