    "To solve the expression (3$4)@5&6 using the defined operations, we need to follow the order of operations and apply each operation step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation a$b is defined as 3*a + 2*b.\n   - The operation a@b is defined as 2*a*b.\n   - The operation a&b is defined as 3*a + 4*b.\n\n2. **Calculate 3$4:**\n   - Using the definition of the $ operation: \n     - 3$4 = 3*3 + 2*4\n     - = 9 + 8\n     - = 17\n\n3. **Calculate (3$4)@5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3$4 as 17.\n   - Now apply the @ operation with 17 and 5:\n     - 17@5 = 2*17*5\n     - = 34*5\n     - = 170\n\n4. **Calculate ((3$4)@5)&6:**\n   - We have calculated (3$4)@5 as 170.\n   - Now apply the & operation with 170 and 6:\n     - 170&6 = 3*170 + 4*6\n     - = 510 + 24\n     - = 534\n\n5. **Final answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression (3$4)@5&6 is 534.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<3, $, 4, @, 5, &, 6, =, 534>>>"
