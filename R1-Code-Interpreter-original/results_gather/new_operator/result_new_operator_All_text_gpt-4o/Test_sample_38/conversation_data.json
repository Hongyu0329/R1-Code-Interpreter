    "To solve the expression (3#4)~5%6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 2*a + 1*b.\n   - Substitute a = 3 and b = 4 into the expression: \n     - 3#4 = 2*3 + 1*4 = 6 + 4 = 10.\n\n2. **Calculate (3#4)~5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 = 10.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 1*a + 3*b.\n   - Substitute a = 10 and b = 5 into the expression:\n     - 10~5 = 1*10 + 3*5 = 10 + 15 = 25.\n\n3. **Calculate (3#4)~5%6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3#4)~5 = 25.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 5*a*b.\n   - Substitute a = 25 and b = 6 into the expression:\n     - 25%6 = 5*25*6 = 750.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3#4 = 10, 10~5 = 25, 25%6 = 750>>>"
