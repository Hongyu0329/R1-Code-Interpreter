    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = 2a + 2b \\).\n\n1. First, calculate \\( 9@4 \\):\n   \\[\n   9@4 = 2 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 4 = 18 + 8 = 26\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\( (9@4)@4 \\):\n   \\[\n   26@4 = 2 \\times 26 + 2 \\times 4 = 52 + 8 = 60\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\( (9@4)@4 \\) is 60.\n\nThe sequence of operations and results is as follows:\n- \\( 9@4 = 26 \\)\n- \\( 26@4 = 60 \\)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<26, 60>>>"
