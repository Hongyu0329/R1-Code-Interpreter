    "To solve the expression \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\&6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\$4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\$4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(5\\&6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 4 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(5\\&6 = 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 120\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\&6\\):**\n   - We have \\((3\\$4) = 12\\) and \\(5\\&6 = 120\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 5 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(12\\sim120 = 5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 120 = 60 + 600 = 660\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\$4)\\sim5\\&6\\) is 660.\n\n<<<12, ~, 120, =, 660>>>"
