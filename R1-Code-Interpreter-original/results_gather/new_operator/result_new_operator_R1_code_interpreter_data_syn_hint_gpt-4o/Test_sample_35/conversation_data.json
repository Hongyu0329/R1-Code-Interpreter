    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a \\# b = 3a + 5b \\). We are asked to calculate \\( (3 \\# 2) \\# 5 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 3 \\# 2 \\):**\n   - Using the definition, \\( 3 \\# 2 = 3 \\times 3 + 5 \\times 2 \\).\n   - This simplifies to \\( 9 + 10 = 19 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 19 \\# 5 \\):**\n   - Now, using the result from the first step, \\( 19 \\# 5 = 3 \\times 19 + 5 \\times 5 \\).\n   - This simplifies to \\( 57 + 25 = 82 \\).\n\nThus, the final result of \\( (3 \\# 2) \\# 5 \\) is 82.\n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<3#2=19, 19#5=82>>>"
