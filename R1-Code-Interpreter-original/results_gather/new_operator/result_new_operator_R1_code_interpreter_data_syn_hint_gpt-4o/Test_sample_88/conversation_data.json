    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the custom operations \\(\\#\\), \\(\\&\\), and \\(\\$\\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\#4 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\):**\n   - We already know \\(3\\#4 = 24\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(24\\&5 = 3 \\times 24 \\times 5 = 360\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\):**\n   - We already know \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 360\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(360\\$6 = 2 \\times 360 \\times 6 = 4320\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\) is 4320.\n\n<<<24, &, 360, $, 4320>>>"
