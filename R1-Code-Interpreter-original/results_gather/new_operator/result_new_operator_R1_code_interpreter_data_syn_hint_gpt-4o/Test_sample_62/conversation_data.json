    "To solve the expression \\((3\\$4)@5&6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and apply the custom operations defined:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\$4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 3a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3\\$4 = 3 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 9 + 8 = 17\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\$4)@5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\$4 = 17\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 2ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 17\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     17@5 = 2 \\times 17 \\times 5 = 170\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\$4)@5&6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\$4)@5 = 170\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 3a + 4b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 170\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     170&6 = 3 \\times 170 + 4 \\times 6 = 510 + 24 = 534\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\$4)@5&6\\) is 534.\n\n<<<17, @, 5, &, 6, =, 534>>>"
