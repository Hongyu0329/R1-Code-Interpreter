    "To solve the expression (3@4)%5&6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate 3@4:**\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 5*a + 2*b.\n   - So, 3@4 = 5*3 + 2*4 = 15 + 8 = 23.\n\n2. **Calculate (3@4)%5:**\n   - We already calculated 3@4 = 23.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 4*a + 1*b.\n   - So, 23%5 = 4*23 + 1*5 = 92 + 5 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3@4)%5)&6:**\n   - We already calculated (3@4)%5 = 97.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 97&6 = (97 + 6)/6 = 103/6.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final result using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 2 * b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 1 * b\n\ndef operation_and(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3@4)%5&6\nresult_at = operation_at(3, 4)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_at, 5)\nresult_and = operation_and(result_percent, 6)\n\nprint(result_and)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression (3@4)%5&6.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the calculation was performed correctly, and the result of the expression (3@4)%5&6 is approximately 17.1667. \n\nTo summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. **3@4** was calculated as 23.\n2. **(3@4)%5** was calculated as 97.\n3. **((3@4)%5)&6** was calculated as 103/6, which equals approximately 17.1667.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the expression (3@4)%5&6 is:\n\n<<<17.1667>>>"
