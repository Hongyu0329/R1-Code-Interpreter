    "To solve the expression \\((3&4)#5~6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3&4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 4a + 3b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3&4 = 4 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3&4)#5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3&4 = 24\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = 3a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 24\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     24#5 = 3 \\times 24 + 2 \\times 5 = 72 + 10 = 82\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(((3&4)#5)~6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3&4)#5 = 82\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 1a + 4b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 82\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     82~6 = 1 \\times 82 + 4 \\times 6 = 82 + 24 = 106\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3&4)#5~6\\) is 106.\n\nThe list of values and symbols used in the calculation is:\n- \\(3&4 = 24\\)\n- \\((3&4)#5 = 82\\)\n- \\(((3&4)#5)~6 = 106\\)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<24, 82, 106>>>"
