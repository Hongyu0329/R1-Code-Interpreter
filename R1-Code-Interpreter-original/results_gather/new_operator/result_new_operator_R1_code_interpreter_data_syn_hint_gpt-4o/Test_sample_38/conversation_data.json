    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 2a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3\\#4 = 2 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = 10\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 1a + 3b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 10\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     10\\sim5 = 1 \\times 10 + 3 \\times 5 = 10 + 15 = 25\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\%6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\#4)\\sim5 = 25\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = 5ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 25\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     25\\%6 = 5 \\times 25 \\times 6 = 750\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\sim5\\%6\\) is 750.\n\nThe list of values and symbols used in the calculation is: \\([3, \\#, 4, \\sim, 5, \\%, 6]\\).\n\n<<<[3, '#', 4, '~', 5, '%', 6]>>>"
