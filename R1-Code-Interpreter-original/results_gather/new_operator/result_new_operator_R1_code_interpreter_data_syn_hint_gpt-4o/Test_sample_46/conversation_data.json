    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression (3&4)@5%6 using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate 3&4:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b is 3*a*b.\n   - So, 3&4 = 3 * 3 * 4 = 36.\n\n2. **Evaluate (3&4)@5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3&4 as 36.\n   - According to the definition, a@b is (a + b)/b.\n   - So, (3&4)@5 = (36 + 5)/5 = 41/5 = 8.2.\n\n3. **Evaluate ((3&4)@5)%6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3&4)@5 as 8.2.\n   - According to the definition, a%b is (a + b)/b.\n   - So, ((3&4)@5)%6 = (8.2 + 6)/6 = 14.2/6 = 2.3667 (approximately).\n\nNow, let's return the answer in the required format.\n\n<<<36, @, 8.2, %, 2.3667>>>"
