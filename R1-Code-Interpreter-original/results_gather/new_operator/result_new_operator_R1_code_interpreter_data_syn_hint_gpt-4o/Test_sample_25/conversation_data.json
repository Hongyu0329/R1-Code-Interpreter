    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol '@'. According to the problem, a@b is defined as 1*a*b. This means that the operation '@' between two numbers a and b is simply the product of a, b, and 1, which simplifies to a*b.\n\nNow, we need to calculate (6@9)@4. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate 6@9:\n   - According to the definition, 6@9 = 1*6*9 = 54.\n\n2. Now, calculate (6@9)@4, which is the same as 54@4:\n   - Again, using the definition, 54@4 = 1*54*4 = 216.\n\nThus, the final result of (6@9)@4 is 216.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<216>>>"
