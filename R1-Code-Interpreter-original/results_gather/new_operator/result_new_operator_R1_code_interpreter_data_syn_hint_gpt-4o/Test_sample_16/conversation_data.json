    "To solve the expression (3@4)#5$6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step according to the operations' definitions:\n\n1. **Calculate 3@4:**\n   - According to the definition, a@b is (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 3@4 = (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Calculate (3@4)#5:**\n   - We already calculated 3@4 = 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a#b is 2*a + 3*b.\n   - So, (7/4)#5 = 2*(7/4) + 3*5 = 7/2 + 15 = 7/2 + 30/2 = 37/2.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3@4)#5)$6:**\n   - We already calculated (3@4)#5 = 37/2.\n   - According to the definition, a$b is (a + b)/b.\n   - So, (37/2)$6 = (37/2 + 6)/6 = (37/2 + 12/2)/6 = 49/2 / 6 = 49/12.\n\nNow, let's verify the calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 3 * b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3@4)#5$6\nresult_at = operation_at(3, 4)\nresult_hash = operation_hash(result_at, 5)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(result_hash, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_dollar)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the final result of the expression.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the calculation was performed correctly, and the result is approximately 4.0833. This matches the expected result of the expression (3@4)#5$6 based on the defined operations.\n\nTo summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. **3@4**: \n   - Calculation: (3 + 4) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75\n\n2. **(3@4)#5**:\n   - Calculation: 2 * (7/4) + 3 * 5 = 7/2 + 15 = 37/2 = 18.5\n\n3. **((3@4)#5)$6**:\n   - Calculation: (37/2 + 6) / 6 = (37/2 + 12/2) / 6 = 49/2 / 6 = 49/12 â‰ˆ 4.0833\n\nThe final result of the expression (3@4)#5$6 is approximately 4.0833.\n\n<<<4.0833>>>"
