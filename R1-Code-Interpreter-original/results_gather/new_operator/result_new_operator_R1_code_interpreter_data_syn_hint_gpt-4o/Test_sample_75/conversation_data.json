    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = 2a + 4b \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\((1@4)@2\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\(1@4\\):\n   \\[\n   1@4 = 2 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 4 = 2 + 16 = 18\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\(18@2\\):\n   \\[\n   18@2 = 2 \\times 18 + 4 \\times 2 = 36 + 8 = 44\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\((1@4)@2\\) is 44.\n\nThe sequence of operations and results is as follows:\n- \\(1@4 = 18\\)\n- \\(18@2 = 44\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1@4=18, 18@2=44>>>"
