    "To solve the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the given operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\%4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = 3 \\times a + 3 \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3\\%4 = 3 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 4 = 9 + 12 = 21\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\%4 = 21\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 21\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     21\\$5 = \\frac{21 + 5}{5} = \\frac{26}{5} = 5.2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\%4)\\$5@6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\%4)\\$5 = 5.2\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 5 \\times a + 1 \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 5.2\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     5.2@6 = 5 \\times 5.2 + 1 \\times 6 = 26 + 6 = 32\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5@6\\) is 32.\n\n<<<21 % 5.2 $ 32 @>>>"
