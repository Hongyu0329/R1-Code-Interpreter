    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined as \\( a@b = 4a + 3b \\).\n\nWe are asked to calculate \\((2@2)@3\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\(2@2\\):\n   \\[\n   2@2 = 4 \\times 2 + 3 \\times 2 = 8 + 6 = 14\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate \\(14@3\\):\n   \\[\n   14@3 = 4 \\times 14 + 3 \\times 3 = 56 + 9 = 65\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of \\((2@2)@3\\) is 65.\n\nThe sequence of operations and values is as follows:\n- \\(2@2 = 14\\)\n- \\(14@3 = 65\\)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<2@2=14, 14@3=65>>>"
