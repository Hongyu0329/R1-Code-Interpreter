    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)$5%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 2*a + 5*b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3@4 = 2*3 + 5*4 = 6 + 20 = 26\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((26)$5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a$b = \\frac{(a + b)}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 26\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     26$5 = \\frac{(26 + 5)}{5} = \\frac{31}{5} = 6.2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(6.2%6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a%b = 1*a*b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 6.2\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     6.2%6 = 1*6.2*6 = 37.2\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3@4)$5%6\\) is 37.2.\n\nThe list of values and symbols used in the calculation is:\n- \\(3@4 = 26\\)\n- \\((26)$5 = 6.2\\)\n- \\(6.2%6 = 37.2\\)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[26, 6.2, 37.2]>>>"
