    "To solve the expression (3@4)%5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step according to the operations' definitions:\n\n1. **Calculate 3@4:**\n   - According to the definition, \\( a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\).\n   - So, \\( 3@4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate (3@4)%5:**\n   - We already calculated \\( 3@4 = 1.75 \\).\n   - According to the definition, \\( a\\%b = 4a + 4b \\).\n   - So, \\( (3@4)\\%5 = 4 \\times 1.75 + 4 \\times 5 = 7 + 20 = 27 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate (3@4)%5#6:**\n   - We already calculated \\( (3@4)\\%5 = 27 \\).\n   - According to the definition, \\( a#b = 1a + 1b \\).\n   - So, \\( (3@4)\\%5#6 = 1 \\times 27 + 1 \\times 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \\).\n\nNow, let's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n- \\( 3@4 = 1.75 \\)\n- \\( (3@4)\\%5 = 27 \\)\n- \\( (3@4)\\%5#6 = 33 \\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.75, 27, 33>>>"
