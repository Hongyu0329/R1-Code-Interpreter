    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 4a + 5b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3\\#4 = 4 \\times 3 + 5 \\times 4 = 12 + 20 = 32\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 4a + 5b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 32\\) (from the previous result) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     32\\$5 = 4 \\times 32 + 5 \\times 5 = 128 + 25 = 153\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\&6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 4a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 153\\) (from the previous result) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     153\\&6 = 4 \\times 153 + 1 \\times 6 = 612 + 6 = 618\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\$5\\&6\\) is 618.\n\nThe sequence of operations and their results are as follows:\n- \\(3\\#4 = 32\\)\n- \\(32\\$5 = 153\\)\n- \\(153\\&6 = 618\\)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[32, '#', 153, '$', 618, '&', 618]>>>"
