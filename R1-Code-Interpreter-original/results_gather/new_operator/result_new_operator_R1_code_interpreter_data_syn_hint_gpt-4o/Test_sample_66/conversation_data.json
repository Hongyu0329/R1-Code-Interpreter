    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)$5%6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 4a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3@4 = 4 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 12 + 8 = 20\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\(20$5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a$b = 5a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 20\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     20$5 = 5 \\times 20 + 1 \\times 5 = 100 + 5 = 105\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(105%6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a%b = 4a + 4b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 105\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     105%6 = 4 \\times 105 + 4 \\times 6 = 420 + 24 = 444\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3@4)$5%6\\) is 444.\n\nThe list of values and symbols used in the calculation is:\n- \\(3@4 = 20\\)\n- \\(20$5 = 105\\)\n- \\(105%6 = 444\\)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[20, 105, 444]>>>"
