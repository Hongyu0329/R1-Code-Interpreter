    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\((9@4)@3\\) using the given operation definition. The operation \\(a@b\\) is defined as \\((a + b)/b\\).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(9@4\\):**\n   - Using the definition, \\(9@4 = (9 + 4)/4 = 13/4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((9@4)@3\\):**\n   - We already found that \\(9@4 = 13/4\\).\n   - Now, substitute \\(13/4\\) for \\(9@4\\) in the expression \\((9@4)@3\\).\n   - \\((13/4)@3 = ((13/4) + 3)/3\\).\n\n3. **Simplify \\((13/4) + 3\\):**\n   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 4: \\(3 = 12/4\\).\n   - Add the fractions: \\((13/4) + (12/4) = 25/4\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\((25/4)/3\\):**\n   - Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by \\(1/3\\).\n   - \\((25/4) \\times (1/3) = 25/12\\).\n\nThus, the final result of \\((9@4)@3\\) is \\(25/12\\).\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<(9@4)@3 = 25/12>>>"
