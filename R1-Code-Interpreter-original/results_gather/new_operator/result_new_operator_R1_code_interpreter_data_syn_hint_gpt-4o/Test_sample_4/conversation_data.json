    "To solve the expression (3%4)#5&6 using the defined operations, we need to follow the order of operations and apply each operation step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate 3%4:**\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 4*a + 2*b.\n   - So, 3%4 = 4*3 + 2*4 = 12 + 8 = 20.\n\n2. **Calculate (3%4)#5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3%4 = 20.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 20#5 = (20 + 5)/5 = 25/5 = 5.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3%4)#5)&6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3%4)#5 = 5.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 5&6 = (5 + 6)/6 = 11/6.\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<20, #, 5, &, 11/6>>>"
