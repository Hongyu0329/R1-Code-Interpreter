    "To solve the expression (3&4)#5~6 using the defined operations, we need to follow the order of operations and apply each operation step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate 3&4:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b = 4*a*b.\n   - So, 3&4 = 4*3*4 = 48.\n\n2. **Calculate (3&4)#5:**\n   - We already calculated 3&4 = 48.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 2*a*b.\n   - So, 48#5 = 2*48*5 = 480.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3&4)#5)~6:**\n   - We already calculated (3&4)#5 = 480.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 4*a + 5*b.\n   - So, 480~6 = 4*480 + 5*6 = 1920 + 30 = 1950.\n\nThus, the final result of the expression (3&4)#5~6 is 1950.\n\nThe list of values and symbols used in the calculation is: [3, &, 4, #, 5, ~, 6].\n\n<<<[3, &, 4, #, 5, ~, 6]>>>"
