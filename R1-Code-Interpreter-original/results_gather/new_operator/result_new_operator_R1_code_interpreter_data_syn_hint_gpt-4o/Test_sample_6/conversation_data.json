    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)#5&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 4a + 5b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3~4 = 4 \\times 3 + 5 \\times 4 = 12 + 20 = 32\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)#5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3~4 = 32\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 32\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     (3~4)#5 = \\frac{32 + 5}{5} = \\frac{37}{5} = 7.4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(((3~4)#5)&6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3~4)#5 = 7.4\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 7.4\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     ((3~4)#5)&6 = 1 \\times 7.4 \\times 6 = 44.4\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3~4)#5&6\\) is 44.4.\n\n<<<32, 7.4, 44.4>>>"
