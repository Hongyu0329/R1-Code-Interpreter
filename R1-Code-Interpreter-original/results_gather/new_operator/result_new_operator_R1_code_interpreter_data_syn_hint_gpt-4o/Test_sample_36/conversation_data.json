    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)@5\\~6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations \\(\\#\\), \\(@\\), and \\(\\~\\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 4a + 1b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3\\#4 = 4 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 = 12 + 4 = 16\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)@5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = 16\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 2ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 16\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     16@5 = 2 \\times 16 \\times 5 = 160\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)@5\\~6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\#4)@5 = 160\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\~b = 3a + 3b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 160\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     160\\~6 = 3 \\times 160 + 3 \\times 6 = 480 + 18 = 498\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)@5\\~6\\) is 498.\n\nThe list of values and symbols used in the calculation is: \\([3, \\#, 4, @, 5, \\~, 6]\\).\n\n<<<[3, '#', 4, '@', 5, '~', 6]>>>"
