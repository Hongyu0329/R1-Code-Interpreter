    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression (4@9)@3 using the given operation definition. The operation a@b is defined as (a + b)/b.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate 4@9:\n   - According to the definition, 4@9 = (4 + 9)/9 = 13/9.\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate (4@9)@3:\n   - Substitute 4@9 with 13/9, so we have (13/9)@3.\n   - According to the definition, (13/9)@3 = ((13/9) + 3)/3.\n\nNow, let's compute the final result using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operation a@b\ndef operation(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate 4@9\nresult_4_9 = operation(4, 9)\n\n# Calculate (4@9)@3\nfinal_result = operation(result_4_9, 3)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression (4@9)@3.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected outcome of the expression (4@9)@3. Let's break down the steps to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Calculate 4@9:**\n   - Using the operation definition, 4@9 = (4 + 9)/9 = 13/9.\n\n2. **Calculate (4@9)@3:**\n   - Substitute 4@9 with 13/9, so we have (13/9)@3.\n   - According to the definition, (13/9)@3 = ((13/9) + 3)/3.\n   - Simplifying this, we get ((13/9) + 3)/3 = (13/9 + 27/9)/3 = 40/9 / 3 = 40/27.\n\n3. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression (4@9)@3 is 40/27, which is approximately 1.4814814814814816.\n\nThe code correctly computes this result, and the output matches the expected value. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<40/27>>>"
