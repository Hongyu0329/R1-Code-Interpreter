    "To solve the expression (3~4)%5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step according to the operations defined:\n\n1. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 5*a + 4*b.\n   - So, 3~4 = 5*3 + 4*4 = 15 + 16 = 31.\n\n2. **Calculate (3~4)%5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3~4 = 31.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 2*a*b.\n   - So, 31%5 = 2*31*5 = 310.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3~4)%5)@6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3~4)%5 = 310.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 4*a + 4*b.\n   - So, 310@6 = 4*310 + 4*6 = 1240 + 24 = 1264.\n\nNow, let's put this into a Python script to verify the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return 5 * a + 4 * b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return 2 * a * b\n\ndef operation_at(a, b):\n    return 4 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Calculate the expression (3~4)%5@6\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_at = operation_at(result_percent, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_at)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculations were performed correctly according to the defined operations. The final result of the expression (3~4)%5@6 is 1264.\n\nThe step-by-step breakdown of the operations was as follows:\n1. Calculate 3~4 = 31.\n2. Calculate (3~4)%5 = 310.\n3. Calculate ((3~4)%5)@6 = 1264.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1264>>>"
