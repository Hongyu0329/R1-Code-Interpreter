    "To solve the expression \\((3&4)@5#6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3&4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 5a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3&4 = 5 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 15 + 8 = 23\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3&4)@5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3&4 = 23\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 3ab\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 23\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     23@5 = 3 \\times 23 \\times 5 = 345\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3&4)@5#6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3&4)@5 = 345\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 345\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     345#6 = \\frac{345 + 6}{6} = \\frac{351}{6} = 58.5\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3&4)@5#6\\) is 58.5.\n\n<<<23, @, 345, #, 58.5>>>"
