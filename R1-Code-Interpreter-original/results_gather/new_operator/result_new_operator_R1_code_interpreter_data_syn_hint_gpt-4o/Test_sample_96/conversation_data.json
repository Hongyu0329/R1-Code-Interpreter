    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)~5#6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations @, ~, and #.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 5 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3@4 = 5 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 60\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(5#6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(5#6 = 1 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3@4)~5#6\\):**\n   - We have \\((3@4) = 60\\) and \\(5#6 = 30\\).\n   - Now, substitute these values into the expression \\((3@4)~5#6\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 2 \\times a + 3 \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(60~30 = 2 \\times 60 + 3 \\times 30 = 120 + 90 = 210\\).\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression \\((3@4)~5#6\\) is 210.\n\n<<<60, ~, 30, =, 210>>>"
