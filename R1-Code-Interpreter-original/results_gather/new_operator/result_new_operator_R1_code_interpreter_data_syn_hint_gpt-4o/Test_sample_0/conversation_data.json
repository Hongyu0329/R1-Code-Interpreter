    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 1 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)&5\\):**\n   - We already know \\(3~4 = 12\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = 5 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\((3~4)&5 = 5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 5 = 60 + 25 = 85\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(85@6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(85@6 = 3 \\times 85 \\times 6\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(85@6\\) using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate 85@6\na = 85\nb = 6\nresult = 3 * a * b\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result for the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\).",
    "The code execution result indicates that \\(85@6 = 1530\\). Now, let's summarize the entire calculation process:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - \\(3~4 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3~4)&5\\):**\n   - \\((3~4)&5 = 5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 5 = 60 + 25 = 85\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(85@6\\):**\n   - \\(85@6 = 3 \\times 85 \\times 6 = 1530\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3~4)&5@6\\) is 1530.\n\n<<<12, &, 85, @, 6, =, 1530>>>"
