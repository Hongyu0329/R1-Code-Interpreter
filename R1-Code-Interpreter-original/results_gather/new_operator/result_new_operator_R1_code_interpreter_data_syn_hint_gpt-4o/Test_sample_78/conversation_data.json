    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 36\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\(36\\$5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(36\\$5 = 3 \\times 36 \\times 5 = 540\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(540@6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(540@6 = \\frac{540 + 6}{6} = \\frac{546}{6} = 91\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3~4)\\$5@6\\) is 91.\n\n<<<36, $, 540, @, 91>>>"
