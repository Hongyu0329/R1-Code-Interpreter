    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol '@'. According to the problem, a@b is defined as 3 * a * b. \n\nWe need to calculate (5@2)@9. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate 5@2:\n   - Using the definition, 5@2 = 3 * 5 * 2.\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate (5@2)@9:\n   - Let x = 5@2.\n   - Then, (5@2)@9 = x@9 = 3 * x * 9.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 5@2\na = 5\nb = 2\nresult_5_2 = 3 * a * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (5@2)@9\nc = 9\nfinal_result = 3 * result_5_2 * c\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for the expression (5@2)@9.",
    "The code execution result of 810 is correct for the expression (5@2)@9. Let's break down the steps to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Calculate 5@2:**\n   - According to the definition, 5@2 = 3 * 5 * 2 = 30.\n\n2. **Calculate (5@2)@9:**\n   - Now, we use the result from the first step: (5@2)@9 = 30@9.\n   - Using the definition again, 30@9 = 3 * 30 * 9 = 810.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and follows the defined operation. The code correctly computes the result as 810.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<810>>>"
