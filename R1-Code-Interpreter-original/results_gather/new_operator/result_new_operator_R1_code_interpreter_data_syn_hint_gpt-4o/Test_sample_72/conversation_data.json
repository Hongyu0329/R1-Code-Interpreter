    "To solve the expression (3&4)~5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step according to the operations' definitions:\n\n1. **Calculate 3&4:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b = 3*a + 2*b.\n   - So, 3&4 = 3*3 + 2*4 = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n2. **Calculate (3&4)~5:**\n   - We already calculated 3&4 as 17.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 4*a*b.\n   - So, 17~5 = 4*17*5 = 340.\n\n3. **Calculate (3&4)~5@6:**\n   - We already calculated (3&4)~5 as 340.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 340@6 = (340 + 6)/6 = 346/6 = 57.6667 (approximately).\n\nNow, let's format the answer with the list of values and symbols used in the calculation:\n\n<<<3, &, 4, ~, 5, @, 6>>>"
