    "To solve the expression \\((3@4)&5#6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3@4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 4a + 2b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     3@4 = 4 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 12 + 8 = 20\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\(20&5\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 20\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     20&5 = \\frac{20 + 5}{5} = \\frac{25}{5} = 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate \\(5#6\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     5#6 = \\frac{5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{11}{6}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's compile the results into the final answer format.\n\nThe expression \\((3@4)&5#6\\) evaluates to \\(\\frac{11}{6}\\).\n\n<<<20, &, 5, #, 6, =, 11/6>>>"
