    "To solve the expression (3~4)%5$6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step according to the operations defined:\n\n1. **Operation `~`:**  \n   - \\( a \\sim b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\)\n   - For \\( 3 \\sim 4 \\), we calculate:\n     \\[\n     3 \\sim 4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\n     \\]\n\n2. **Operation `%`:**  \n   - \\( a \\% b = \\frac{a + b}{b} \\)\n   - For \\( 1.75 \\% 5 \\), we calculate:\n     \\[\n     1.75 \\% 5 = \\frac{1.75 + 5}{5} = \\frac{6.75}{5} = 1.35\n     \\]\n\n3. **Operation `$`:**  \n   - \\( a \\$ b = 2a + 4b \\)\n   - For \\( 1.35 \\$ 6 \\), we calculate:\n     \\[\n     1.35 \\$ 6 = 2 \\times 1.35 + 4 \\times 6 = 2.7 + 24 = 26.7\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's verify these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_tilde(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 4 * b\n\n# Calculate step by step\nresult_tilde = operation_tilde(3, 4)\nresult_percent = operation_percent(result_tilde, 5)\nresult_dollar = operation_dollar(result_percent, 6)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result_dollar)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result for the expression (3~4)%5$6.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculations were performed correctly, and the final result of the expression (3~4)%5$6 is 26.7. The operations were defined and executed as per the given definitions, and the step-by-step calculations were verified using Python code.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression (3~4)%5$6 is:\n\n<<<26.7>>>"
