    "To solve the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\sim6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the given operations:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3\\%4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\%b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\%4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\):**\n   - We already calculated \\(3\\%4 = \\frac{7}{4}\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\((3\\%4)\\$5 = \\frac{\\frac{7}{4} + 5}{5}\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\sim6\\):**\n   - We need to first calculate \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\) from the previous step.\n   - Then, use the result to evaluate the final operation.\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\sim b = 1 \\times a + 5 \\times b\\).\n\nLet's calculate these step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3%4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_1 = (a + b) / b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3%4)$5\nc = 5\nresult_2 = (result_1 + c) / c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate (3%4)$5~6\nd = 6\nresult_3 = 1 * result_2 + 5 * d\n\nprint(result_1, result_2, result_3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the values of each step.",
    "The code execution result provides the intermediate and final values for the operations defined in the problem. Let's break down the results:\n\n1. **\\(3\\%4\\):** \n   - The result is \\(1.75\\), which is \\(\\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\n2. **\\((3\\%4)\\$5\\):**\n   - The result is \\(1.35\\), which is \\(\\frac{1.75 + 5}{5}\\).\n\n3. **\\((3\\%4)\\$5\\sim6\\):**\n   - The result is \\(31.35\\), which is \\(1 \\times 1.35 + 5 \\times 6\\).\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the definitions provided for the operations. Therefore, the final answer for the expression \\((3\\%4)\\$5\\sim6\\) is:\n\n<<<1.75, 1.35, 31.35>>>"
