    "To solve the expression (3#4)@5&6, we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b = 1*a + 4*b.\n   - So, 3#4 = 1*3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19.\n\n2. **Evaluate (3#4)@5:**\n   - We have already calculated 3#4 = 19.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 19@5 = (19 + 5)/5 = 24/5 = 4.8.\n\n3. **Evaluate ((3#4)@5)&6:**\n   - We have already calculated (3#4)@5 = 4.8.\n   - According to the definition, a&b = (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 4.8&6 = (4.8 + 6)/6 = 10.8/6 = 1.8.\n\nNow, let's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n- 3#4 = 19\n- (3#4)@5 = 4.8\n- ((3#4)@5)&6 = 1.8\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19, 4.8, 1.8>>>"
