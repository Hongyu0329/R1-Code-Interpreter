    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3\\#4 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\):**\n   - We already found that \\(3\\#4 = 24\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 3 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(24\\&5 = 3 \\times 24 \\times 5 = 360\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5@6\\):**\n   - We already found that \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 360\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a@b = 4 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(360@6 = 4 \\times 360 \\times 6 = 8640\\).\n\nNow, let's return the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<[3, '#', 4, '&', 5, '@', 6, '=', 8640]>>>"
