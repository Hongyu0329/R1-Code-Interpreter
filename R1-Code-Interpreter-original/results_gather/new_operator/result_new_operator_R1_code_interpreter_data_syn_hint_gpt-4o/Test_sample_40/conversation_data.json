    "To solve the expression (3~4)#5$6 using the defined operations, we need to follow the order of operations and apply each operation step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b is 1 * a * b.\n   - So, 3~4 = 1 * 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n2. **Calculate (3~4)#5:**\n   - We already calculated 3~4 as 12.\n   - According to the definition, a#b is (a + b) / b.\n   - So, 12#5 = (12 + 5) / 5 = 17 / 5 = 3.4.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3~4)#5)$6:**\n   - We already calculated (3~4)#5 as 3.4.\n   - According to the definition, a$b is (a + b) / b.\n   - So, 3.4$6 = (3.4 + 6) / 6 = 9.4 / 6 = 1.566666...\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<3~4#5$6>>>"
