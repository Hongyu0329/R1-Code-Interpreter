    "To solve the expression (3~4)$5#6, we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate 3~4:**\n   - According to the definition, a~b is (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 3~4 = (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Evaluate (3~4)$5:**\n   - We already calculated 3~4 as 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a$b is 3*a*b.\n   - So, (3~4)$5 = 3*(7/4)*5.\n\n3. **Evaluate ((3~4)$5)#6:**\n   - We need to first calculate (3~4)$5.\n   - Then, according to the definition, a#b is (a + b)/b.\n   - So, ((3~4)$5)#6 = ((3~4)$5 + 6)/6.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 3~4\na = 3\nb = 4\nresult_3_tilde_4 = (a + b) / b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (3~4)$5\nc = 5\nresult_3_tilde_4_dollar_5 = 3 * result_3_tilde_4 * c\n\n# Step 3: Calculate ((3~4)$5)#6\nd = 6\nfinal_result = (result_3_tilde_4_dollar_5 + d) / d\n\nprint(result_3_tilde_4, result_3_tilde_4_dollar_5, final_result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the values for each step, and we can provide the final answer in the required format.",
    "The code execution result provides us with the intermediate and final values for the expression (3~4)$5#6. Let's break down the results:\n\n1. **3~4 = 1.75**: This is the result of the operation (3 + 4)/4.\n2. **(3~4)$5 = 26.25**: This is the result of the operation 3 * (7/4) * 5.\n3. **((3~4)$5)#6 = 5.375**: This is the result of the operation (26.25 + 6)/6.\n\nNow, we can provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<1.75, 26.25, 5.375>>>"
