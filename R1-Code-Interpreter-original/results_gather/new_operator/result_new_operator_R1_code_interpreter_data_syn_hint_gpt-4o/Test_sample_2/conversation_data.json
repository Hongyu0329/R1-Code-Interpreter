    "To solve the expression (3&4)~5@6 using the defined operations, we need to follow the order of operations and apply each operation step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate 3&4:**\n   - According to the definition, a&b = 1*a*b.\n   - So, 3&4 = 1*3*4 = 12.\n\n2. **Calculate (3&4)~5:**\n   - We already calculated 3&4 = 12.\n   - According to the definition, a~b = 3*a*b.\n   - So, 12~5 = 3*12*5 = 180.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3&4)~5)@6:**\n   - We already calculated (3&4)~5 = 180.\n   - According to the definition, a@b = 2*a + 2*b.\n   - So, 180@6 = 2*180 + 2*6 = 360 + 12 = 372.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression (3&4)~5@6 is 372.\n\n<<<12, ~, 5, @, 6, =, 372>>>"
