    "To solve the expression (3#4)$5%6 using the defined operations, we need to evaluate it step by step according to the given definitions:\n\n1. **Calculate 3#4:**\n   - According to the definition, a#b is (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 3#4 = (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Calculate (3#4)$5:**\n   - We already found that 3#4 = 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a$b is 2*a + 5*b.\n   - So, (3#4)$5 = 2*(7/4) + 5*5 = 7/2 + 25 = 7/2 + 50/2 = 57/2.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3#4)$5)%6:**\n   - We already found that (3#4)$5 = 57/2.\n   - According to the definition, a%b is (a + b)/b.\n   - So, ((3#4)$5)%6 = (57/2 + 6)/6 = (57/2 + 12/2)/6 = 69/2 / 6 = 69/12 = 23/4.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final result using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the operations\ndef operation_hash(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\ndef operation_dollar(a, b):\n    return 2 * a + 5 * b\n\ndef operation_percent(a, b):\n    return (a + b) / b\n\n# Calculate step by step\nresult_3_hash_4 = operation_hash(3, 4)\nresult_3_hash_4_dollar_5 = operation_dollar(result_3_hash_4, 5)\nfinal_result = operation_percent(result_3_hash_4_dollar_5, 6)\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code execution result of 5.75 is correct, and it matches the expected result of the expression (3#4)$5%6 based on the defined operations. Let's break down the steps again to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **3#4 Calculation:**\n   - \\(3 \\# 4 = \\frac{3 + 4}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\\)\n\n2. **(3#4)$5 Calculation:**\n   - \\((3 \\# 4) \\$ 5 = 2 \\times \\frac{7}{4} + 5 \\times 5 = \\frac{7}{2} + 25 = \\frac{7}{2} + \\frac{50}{2} = \\frac{57}{2} = 28.5\\)\n\n3. **((3#4)$5)%6 Calculation:**\n   - \\(((3 \\# 4) \\$ 5) \\% 6 = \\frac{\\frac{57}{2} + 6}{6} = \\frac{28.5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{34.5}{6} = 5.75\\)\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the operations defined, and the final result is indeed 5.75. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5.75>>>"
