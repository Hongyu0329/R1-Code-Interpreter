    "To solve the problem, we need to understand the operation defined by the symbol '@'. According to the problem, a@b is defined as 5 * a * b. \n\nWe need to calculate (4@7)@2. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate 4@7:\n   - Using the definition, 4@7 = 5 * 4 * 7.\n\n2. Next, use the result from step 1 to calculate (4@7)@2:\n   - Let x = 4@7.\n   - Then, (4@7)@2 = x@2 = 5 * x * 2.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 4@7\na = 4\nb = 7\nresult_4_7 = 5 * a * b\n\n# Step 2: Calculate (4@7)@2\nc = 2\nfinal_result = 5 * result_4_7 * c\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result for (4@7)@2.",
    "The code execution result of 1400 is correct for the calculation of (4@7)@2. Let's break down the steps to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Calculate 4@7:**\n   - According to the operation definition, 4@7 = 5 * 4 * 7 = 140.\n\n2. **Calculate (4@7)@2:**\n   - Using the result from the first step, (4@7)@2 = 140@2 = 5 * 140 * 2 = 1400.\n\nThe calculation steps are straightforward and the code correctly implements these steps. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1400>>>"
