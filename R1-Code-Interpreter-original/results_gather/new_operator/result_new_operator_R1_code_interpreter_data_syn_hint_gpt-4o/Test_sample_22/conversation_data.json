    "To solve the expression \\((3~4)#5&6\\), we need to evaluate it step by step using the defined operations.\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(3~4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a~b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\(3~4 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\((3~4)#5\\):**\n   - We already know \\(3~4 = 24\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a#b = 4 \\times a + 3 \\times b\\).\n   - So, \\((3~4)#5 = 4 \\times 24 + 3 \\times 5 = 96 + 15 = 111\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate \\((3~4)#5&6\\):**\n   - We already know \\((3~4)#5 = 111\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a&b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - So, \\((3~4)#5&6 = \\frac{111 + 6}{6} = \\frac{117}{6} = 19.5\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3~4)#5&6\\) is 19.5.\n\n<<<19.5>>>"
