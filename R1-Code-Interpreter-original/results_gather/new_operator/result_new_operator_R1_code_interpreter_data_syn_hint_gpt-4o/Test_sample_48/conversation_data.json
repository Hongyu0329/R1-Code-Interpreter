    "To solve the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\), we need to follow the order of operations and the definitions of the new operations \\(\\#\\), \\(\\&\\), and \\(\\$\\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\(3\\#4\\):**\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\#b = 1 \\times a + 4 \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\): \n     \\[\n     3\\#4 = 1 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 4 = 3 + 16 = 19\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\(3\\#4 = 19\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\&b = 2 \\times a \\times b\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 19\\) and \\(b = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     19\\&5 = 2 \\times 19 \\times 5 = 190\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\):**\n   - We have already calculated \\((3\\#4)\\&5 = 190\\).\n   - According to the definition, \\(a\\$b = \\frac{a + b}{b}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(a = 190\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     190\\$6 = \\frac{190 + 6}{6} = \\frac{196}{6} = 32.6667\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression \\((3\\#4)\\&5\\$6\\) is approximately 32.6667.\n\n<<<19, &, 5, $, 6, =, 32.6667>>>"
