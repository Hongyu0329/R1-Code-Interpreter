    "To solve the expression (3$4)%5#6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step according to the operations defined:\n\n1. **Calculate 3$4:**\n   - According to the definition, a$b = (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 3$4 = (3 + 4)/4 = 7/4.\n\n2. **Calculate (3$4)%5:**\n   - We already calculated 3$4 = 7/4.\n   - According to the definition, a%b = 4*a + 4*b.\n   - So, (7/4)%5 = 4*(7/4) + 4*5 = 7 + 20 = 27.\n\n3. **Calculate ((3$4)%5)#6:**\n   - We already calculated (3$4)%5 = 27.\n   - According to the definition, a#b = (a + b)/b.\n   - So, 27#6 = (27 + 6)/6 = 33/6 = 5.5.\n\nNow, let's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n- 3$4 = 7/4\n- (3$4)%5 = 27\n- ((3$4)%5)#6 = 5.5\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7/4, 27, 5.5>>>"
