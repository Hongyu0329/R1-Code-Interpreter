    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of robots, helmets, and footballs in the changing room and then sum them up to find the total number of items.\n\n1. We are given that there are 20 helmets.\n2. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\).\n3. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs is \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of items by summing the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\nhelmets = 20\nrobots = helmets / 2\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\nprint(total_items)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total number of items Dominick saw.",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the output of 70.0. This means that the total number of items Dominick saw in the changing room is 70. \n\nThe calculation was as follows:\n- Number of helmets = 20\n- Number of robots = 10 (half of helmets)\n- Number of footballs = 40 (twice the helmets)\n\nTotal items = 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs) = 70\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<70>>>"
