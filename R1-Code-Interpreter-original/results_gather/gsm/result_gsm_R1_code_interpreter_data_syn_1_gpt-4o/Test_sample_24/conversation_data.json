  "question": "On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs. She had 7248186 green ones, twice as many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Cindy collected based on the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 7,248,186 green eggs.\n\n2. **Blue Eggs**: Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \\(2 \\times 7,248,186\\).\n\n3. **Pink Eggs**: Cindy has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is \\((2 \\times 7,248,186) - 1\\).\n\n4. **Yellow Eggs**: Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 7,248,186) - 1}{3}\\).\n\n5. **Total Eggs**: The total number of eggs is the sum of all the eggs: green, blue, pink, and yellow.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of green eggs\ngreen_eggs = 7248186\n\n# Number of blue eggs\nblue_eggs = 2 * green_eggs\n\n# Number of pink eggs\npink_eggs = blue_eggs - 1\n\n# Number of yellow eggs\nyellow_eggs = pink_eggs // 3\n\n# Total number of eggs\ntotal_eggs = green_eggs + blue_eggs + pink_eggs + yellow_eggs\n\nprint(total_eggs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of eggs Cindy collected.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of eggs Cindy collected is 41,073,052. \n\nLet's summarize the solution:\n\n- Green eggs: 7,248,186\n- Blue eggs: \\(2 \\times 7,248,186 = 14,496,372\\)\n- Pink eggs: \\(14,496,372 - 1 = 14,496,371\\)\n- Yellow eggs: \\(\\frac{14,496,371}{3} = 4,832,123\\)\n\nAdding them all together gives us the total number of eggs:\n\n\\[7,248,186 + 14,496,372 + 14,496,371 + 4,832,123 = 41,073,052\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs Cindy had is:\n\n<<<41073052>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs.
