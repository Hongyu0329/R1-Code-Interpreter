    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tom has to pay per month for the new bedroom set after selling his old one and applying the proceeds to the cost of the new set.\n\n1. **Initial Cost of New Bedroom Set**: $3000\n2. **Proceeds from Selling Old Bedroom Set**: $9002017\n\nFirst, we calculate the remaining balance after using the proceeds from the old bedroom set to pay for the new one:\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining Balance} = \\text{Cost of New Bedroom Set} - \\text{Proceeds from Old Bedroom Set} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining balance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Monthly Payment} = 0.10 \\times \\text{Remaining Balance} \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Initial cost of the new bedroom set\ncost_new_bedroom_set = 3000\n\n# Proceeds from selling the old bedroom set\nproceeds_old_bedroom_set = 9002017\n\n# Calculate the remaining balance\nremaining_balance = cost_new_bedroom_set - proceeds_old_bedroom_set\n\n# Calculate the monthly payment (10% of the remaining balance)\nmonthly_payment = 0.10 * remaining_balance\n\n# Output the monthly payment\nprint(monthly_payment)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the monthly payment.",
    "The code execution shows that the remaining balance is negative, which means Tom has more than enough money from selling his old bedroom set to cover the cost of the new one. Therefore, he doesn't need to pay anything per month because the proceeds from the old set exceed the cost of the new set.\n\nThe negative value indicates that Tom has an excess amount of $899,901.70 after purchasing the new bedroom set. Since the remaining balance is negative, the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining balance, is also negative, indicating no payment is required.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
