    "To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to consider the total number of women wearing heels and the total height contributed by these heels.\n\n1. **Identify the number of women and heel heights:**\n   - 3 women are wearing 4-inch heels.\n   - 8,449,158 women are wearing 2-inch heels.\n\n2. **Calculate the total height contributed by each group:**\n   - Total height from women wearing 4-inch heels = 3 * 4 inches.\n   - Total height from women wearing 2-inch heels = 8,449,158 * 2 inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of women wearing heels:**\n   - Total number of women = 3 + 8,449,158.\n\n4. **Calculate the average height of heels:**\n   - Average height = (Total height from all heels) / (Total number of women).\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of women wearing each type of heel\nwomen_4_inch = 3\nwomen_2_inch = 8449158\n\n# Total height contributed by each group\ntotal_height_4_inch = women_4_inch * 4\ntotal_height_2_inch = women_2_inch * 2\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = women_4_inch + women_2_inch\n\n# Average height of heels\naverage_height = (total_height_4_inch + total_height_2_inch) / total_women\n\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the average height of heels at the party.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is the average height of the heels at the party. The result is approximately 2.0000007101296804 inches. This value is very close to 2 inches, which makes sense given that the vast majority of women (8,449,158 out of 8,449,161) are wearing 2-inch heels.\n\nTherefore, the average height of heels at the party is:\n\n<<<2.0000007101296804>>>"
