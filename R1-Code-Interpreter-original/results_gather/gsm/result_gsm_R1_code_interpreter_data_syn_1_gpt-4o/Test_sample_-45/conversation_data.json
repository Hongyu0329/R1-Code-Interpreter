  "question": "It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. If a packet of tomato seeds costs $2802500 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30, how much money did she use to buy the seeds?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts to find the total expenditure.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of tomato seeds:**\n   - Number of packets of tomato seeds = 20\n   - Cost per packet of tomato seeds = $2802500\n   - Total cost for tomato seeds = Number of packets * Cost per packet\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of celery seeds:**\n   - Number of packets of celery seeds = 80\n   - Cost per packet of celery seeds = $30\n   - Total cost for celery seeds = Number of packets * Cost per packet\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - Total cost = Total cost for tomato seeds + Total cost for celery seeds\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of packets\ntomato_packets = 20\ncelery_packets = 80\n\n# Cost per packet\ncost_per_tomato_packet = 2802500\ncost_per_celery_packet = 30\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost_tomato = tomato_packets * cost_per_tomato_packet\ntotal_cost_celery = celery_packets * cost_per_celery_packet\ntotal_cost = total_cost_tomato + total_cost_celery\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total cost.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total cost of the seeds was calculated without any errors. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds.\n\nThe total cost of the seeds is $56,052,400.\n\n<<<56052400>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.
