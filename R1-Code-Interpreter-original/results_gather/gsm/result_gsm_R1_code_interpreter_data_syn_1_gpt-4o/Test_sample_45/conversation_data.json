    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of robots, helmets, and footballs based on the given relationships and then sum them up to find the total number of items.\n\n1. We know there are 20 helmets.\n2. The number of robots is half the number of helmets.\n3. The number of footballs is twice the number of helmets.\n\nLet's calculate these values:\n\n- Number of helmets = 20\n- Number of robots = 20 / 2 = 10\n- Number of footballs = 20 * 2 = 40\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of items by summing the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.\n\n```python\nhelmets = 20\nrobots = helmets / 2\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\ntotal_items = helmets + robots + footballs\nprint(total_items)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of items.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is 70.0. This means that the total number of items Dominick saw in the changing room is 70. \n\nThe calculation was done as follows:\n- Helmets: 20\n- Robots: 10 (half of 20)\n- Footballs: 40 (twice of 20)\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 70 items.\n\n<<<70>>>"
