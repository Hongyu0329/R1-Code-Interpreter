    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total age of all the siblings in the family. Here's the breakdown of the information given:\n\n1. There are 2 brothers.\n2. There are 2,620,008 sisters, each 16 years old.\n3. One brother is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.\n\nFirst, let's determine the age of the older brother. Since the younger brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, the older brother must be 24 years old.\n\nNext, we calculate the total age of all the sisters. Since there are 2,620,008 sisters and each is 16 years old, we multiply the number of sisters by their age.\n\nFinally, we add the ages of the two brothers and the total age of all the sisters to get the total age of all the siblings.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters and their age\nnum_sisters = 2620008\nage_of_sisters = 16\n\n# Ages of the brothers\nage_of_younger_brother = 12\nage_of_older_brother = 24\n\n# Total age of all sisters\ntotal_age_of_sisters = num_sisters * age_of_sisters\n\n# Total age of all siblings\ntotal_age_of_siblings = total_age_of_sisters + age_of_younger_brother + age_of_older_brother\n\nprint(total_age_of_siblings)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total age of all the siblings.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total age of all the siblings is calculated correctly. \n\nThe total age of all the siblings is the sum of the ages of the two brothers and all the sisters. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Total age of the sisters: \\(2,620,008 \\times 16 = 41,920,128\\)\n- Age of the younger brother: 12\n- Age of the older brother: 24\n\nAdding these together gives us the total age:\n\n\\[41,920,128 + 12 + 24 = 41,920,164\\]\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings is:\n\n<<<41920164>>>"
