    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, and this length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.\n\nFirst, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so:\n\n- 8 feet = 8 * 12 inches = 96 inches\n- 4 inches = 4 inches\n\nTherefore, the total length of Topher's shoe in inches is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.\n\nNext, let's set up the equation based on the problem statement:\n\nLet \\( b \\) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 100 = 9b + 10 \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for \\( b \\).\n\n```python\n# Define the length of Topher's shoe in inches\ntopher_shoe_length = 100\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\n# 100 = 9 * b + 10\n# Solve for b\nbobby_shoe_length = (topher_shoe_length - 10) / 9\n\n# Print the length of Bobby's shoe\nprint(bobby_shoe_length)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the length of Bobby's shoe.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10.0>>>"
