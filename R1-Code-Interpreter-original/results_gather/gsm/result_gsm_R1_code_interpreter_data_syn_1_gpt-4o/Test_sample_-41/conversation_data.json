    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras and then find the average number of stripes per zebra.\n\n1. **Identify the number of stripes on each zebra:**\n   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \\(2 \\times 17\\)\n   - One zebra with 3,009,606 stripes.\n   - One zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes: \\(\\frac{3009606}{2}\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of stripes:**\n   - Total stripes from the first two zebras: \\(2 \\times 17\\)\n   - Total stripes from the third zebra: \\(3009606\\)\n   - Total stripes from the fourth zebra: \\(\\frac{3009606}{2}\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the average number of stripes:**\n   - Total number of zebras: 4\n   - Average stripes = \\(\\frac{\\text{Total stripes}}{\\text{Number of zebras}}\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of stripes for each zebra\nstripes_zebra1_2 = 2 * 17\nstripes_zebra3 = 3009606\nstripes_zebra4 = 3009606 / 2\n\n# Total number of stripes\ntotal_stripes = stripes_zebra1_2 + stripes_zebra3 + stripes_zebra4\n\n# Number of zebras\nnumber_of_zebras = 4\n\n# Average number of stripes\naverage_stripes = total_stripes / number_of_zebras\n\nprint(average_stripes)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the average number of stripes.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the average number of stripes per zebra. \n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n- Two zebras with 17 stripes each contribute \\(2 \\times 17 = 34\\) stripes.\n- One zebra with 3,009,606 stripes contributes 3,009,606 stripes.\n- Another zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes contributes \\(\\frac{3009606}{2} = 1,504,803\\) stripes.\n- Total stripes = \\(34 + 3,009,606 + 1,504,803 = 4,514,443\\).\n- Average stripes per zebra = \\(\\frac{4,514,443}{4} = 1,128,610.75\\).\n\nThus, the average number of stripes per zebra is:\n\n<<<1128610.75>>>"
