    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of the adults:**\n   - There are 9 adults in total (Jack + 8 others).\n   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.\n   - Total weight = Number of adults * Average weight per adult.\n\n2. **Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum load:**\n   - Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg.\n   - If the total weight exceeds 700 kg, calculate by how much it exceeds.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Constants\naverage_weight_per_adult = 80  # kg\nnumber_of_adults = 9\nmaximum_load = 700  # kg\n\n# Calculate total weight of the adults\ntotal_weight = number_of_adults * average_weight_per_adult\n\n# Calculate the excess weight\nexcess_weight = total_weight - maximum_load\n\n# Output the result\nprint(excess_weight)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the excess weight.",
    "The code execution shows that the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
