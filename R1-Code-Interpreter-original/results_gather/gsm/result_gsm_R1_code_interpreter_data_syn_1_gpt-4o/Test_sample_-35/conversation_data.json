    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference between the two amounts.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost for the baseball coach:**\n   - The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs, each costing $9414724.\n   - Total cost for baseballs = 9 * $9414724\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost for the basketball coach:**\n   - The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs, each costing $14.\n   - Total cost for basketballs = 8 * $14\n\n3. **Find the difference in spending:**\n   - Difference = Total cost for basketballs - Total cost for baseballs\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate total cost for baseball coach\nbaseball_cost_per_ball = 9414724\nnumber_of_baseballs = 9\ntotal_baseball_cost = baseball_cost_per_ball * number_of_baseballs\n\n# Calculate total cost for basketball coach\nbasketball_cost_per_ball = 14\nnumber_of_basketballs = 8\ntotal_basketball_cost = basketball_cost_per_ball * number_of_basketballs\n\n# Calculate the difference in spending\ndifference = total_basketball_cost - total_baseball_cost\n\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the difference in spending.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result of the calculation. The difference in spending between the basketball coach and the baseball coach is -84732404. This means that the basketball coach spent $84,732,404 less than the baseball coach.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-84732404>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Two sports coaches went shopping together.
