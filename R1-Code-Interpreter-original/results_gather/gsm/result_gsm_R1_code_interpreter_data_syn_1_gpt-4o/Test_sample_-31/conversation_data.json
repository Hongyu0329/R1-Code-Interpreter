  "question": "Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. 5351035 students need size extra-small.  Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.  Half as many students need size large as size medium.  Six more students need size extra-large than large.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of shirts ordered for each size and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Extra-Small (XS):** We know that 5351035 students need size extra-small.\n\n2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is \\(2 \\times 5351035\\).\n\n3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of medium shirts needed is \\((2 \\times 5351035) - 4\\).\n\n4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 5351035) - 4}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Extra-Large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of extra-large shirts needed is \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 5351035) - 4}{2} + 6\\).\n\nFinally, we sum up all these values to get the total number of shirts ordered.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of students needing each size\nextra_small = 5351035\nsmall = 2 * extra_small\nmedium = small - 4\nlarge = medium // 2\nextra_large = large + 6\n\n# Total number of shirts ordered\ntotal_shirts = extra_small + small + medium + large + extra_large\n\nprint(total_shirts)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the total number of shirts ordered.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of shirts ordered is 37,457,243. \n\nLet's summarize the calculations:\n\n- Extra-Small (XS): 5,351,035\n- Small (S): 10,702,070\n- Medium (M): 10,702,066\n- Large (L): 5,351,033\n- Extra-Large (XL): 5,351,039\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of shirts ordered.\n\n<<<37457243>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. 5351035 students need size extra-small.
