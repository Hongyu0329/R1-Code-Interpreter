    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pink gumballs based on the given relationship with the blue gumballs.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue gumballs.\n2. Let \\( p \\) be the number of pink gumballs.\n3. According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   p = 4b + 22\n   \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( b = 9913180 \\)\n\nWe need to calculate \\( p \\) using the formula above.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of blue gumballs\nb = 9913180\n\n# Calculate the number of pink gumballs\np = 4 * b + 22\n\n# Output the result\nprint(p)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the number of pink gumballs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the number of pink gumballs. Based on the calculation, the number of pink gumballs is 39,652,742.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<39652742>>>"
