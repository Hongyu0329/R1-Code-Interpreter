    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total population of the school and then calculate the number of girls.\n\n1. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and the number of boys is 560,233.\n2. Therefore, the boys represent 40% of the total school population.\n3. We can set up the equation: 0.40 * Total Population = 560,233.\n4. Solving for the Total Population, we get: Total Population = 560,233 / 0.40.\n5. Once we have the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given data\nboys = 560233\nboys_percentage = 0.40\n\n# Calculate total population\ntotal_population = boys / boys_percentage\n\n# Calculate number of girls\ngirls = total_population - boys\n\n# Output the number of girls\nprint(girls)\n```",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output indicates the number of girls in the school. Since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we should round the result to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe number of girls in the school is approximately 840,350.\n\n<<<840350>>>"
