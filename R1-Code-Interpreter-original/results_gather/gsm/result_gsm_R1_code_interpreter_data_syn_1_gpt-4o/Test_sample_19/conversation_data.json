    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost James incurs in the first year for buying and maintaining the plane. The costs include:\n\n1. The initial cost of buying the plane.\n2. The monthly cost of renting a hanger.\n3. The monthly cost of fuel.\n\nLet's break down the costs:\n\n- The cost of the plane is $150,000.\n- The monthly hanger rental cost is $8,578,246.\n- The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental cost, which is \\(2 \\times 8,578,246\\).\n\nTo find the total cost for the first year, we need to calculate:\n\n- The total hanger rental cost for 12 months.\n- The total fuel cost for 12 months.\n- Add these to the initial cost of the plane.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Initial cost of the plane\nplane_cost = 150000\n\n# Monthly costs\nhanger_rent = 8578246\nfuel_cost = 2 * hanger_rent\n\n# Total costs for 12 months\ntotal_hanger_rent = hanger_rent * 12\ntotal_fuel_cost = fuel_cost * 12\n\n# Total cost for the first year\ntotal_cost = plane_cost + total_hanger_rent + total_fuel_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total cost for the first year.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $308,966,856.\n\n<<<308966856>>>"
