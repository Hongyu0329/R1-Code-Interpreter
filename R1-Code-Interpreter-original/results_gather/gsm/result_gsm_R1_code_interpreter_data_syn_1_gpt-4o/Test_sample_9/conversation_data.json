    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.\n\n1. First, we calculate Joey's weekly weight loss. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 2 \\text{ pounds per week}\n   \\]\n\n2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \\frac{2 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \\text{ pounds per week}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can calculate this by dividing the total weight Sandy needs to lose by her weekly weight loss:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weeks for Sandy} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{0.5 \\text{ pounds per week}}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose 8 pounds\nsandy_weekly_loss = 0.5  # pounds per week\ntotal_weight_loss = 8  # pounds\n\nweeks_for_sandy = total_weight_loss / sandy_weekly_loss\nprint(weeks_for_sandy)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose 8 pounds.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated that it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16.0>>>"
