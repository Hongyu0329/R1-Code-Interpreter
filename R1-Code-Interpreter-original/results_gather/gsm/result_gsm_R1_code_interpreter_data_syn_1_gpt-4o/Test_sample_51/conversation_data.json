    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cherry tomato vines Steve needs to grow to meet his and his girlfriend's consumption needs.\n\n1. **Determine Daily Consumption:**\n   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.\n   - His girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats, so she eats 3 tomatoes per day.\n   - Total daily consumption for both is \\(6 + 3 = 9\\) tomatoes.\n\n2. **Determine Weekly Consumption:**\n   - Since they consume 9 tomatoes per day, their weekly consumption is \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\) tomatoes.\n\n3. **Determine Weekly Production per Vine:**\n   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Vines Needed:**\n   - To meet the weekly consumption of 63 tomatoes, we need to find how many vines are required if each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.\n   - The number of vines needed is the total weekly consumption divided by the production per vine.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given data\nsteve_daily = 6\ngirlfriend_daily = steve_daily / 2\ntotal_daily = steve_daily + girlfriend_daily\ntotal_weekly = total_daily * 7\nproduction_per_vine = 3\n\n# Calculate number of vines needed\nvines_needed = total_weekly / production_per_vine\nprint(vines_needed)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the number of vines needed.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Steve needs 21 vines to meet the weekly consumption of tomatoes for both himself and his girlfriend. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grows his own cherry tomatoes.
