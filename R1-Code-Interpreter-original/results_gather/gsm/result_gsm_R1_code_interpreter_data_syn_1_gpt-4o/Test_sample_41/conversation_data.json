    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total population of the school and then calculate the number of girls.\n\n1. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and the number of boys is 560,233.\n2. Let's denote the total population of the school as \\( P \\).\n3. According to the problem, 40% of \\( P \\) is equal to 560,233. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.4 \\times P = 560233\n   \\]\n4. Solving for \\( P \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{560233}{0.4}\n   \\]\n5. Once we have the total population \\( P \\), we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = P - 560233\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given data\nboys = 560233\npercentage_boys = 0.4\n\n# Calculate total population\ntotal_population = boys / percentage_boys\n\n# Calculate number of girls\ngirls = total_population - boys\n\n# Output the number of girls\nprint(int(girls))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the number of girls.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates the number of girls in the school. Based on the calculations, the number of girls is 840,349.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<840349>>>"
