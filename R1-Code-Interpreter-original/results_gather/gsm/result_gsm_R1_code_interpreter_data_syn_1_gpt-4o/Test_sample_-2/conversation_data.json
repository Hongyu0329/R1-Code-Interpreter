    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cherry tomato vines Steve needs to grow to satisfy his and his girlfriend's consumption.\n\n1. **Determine the total number of tomatoes consumed per day:**\n   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.\n   - His girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) tomatoes per day.\n   - Total daily consumption = Steve's consumption + Girlfriend's consumption = \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\) tomatoes per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly consumption:**\n   - Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly consumption is \\( 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\) tomatoes per week.\n\n3. **Determine the number of vines needed:**\n   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.\n   - To find the number of vines needed, divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week.\n\nLet's calculate the number of vines needed using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nsteve_daily = 6\ngirlfriend_daily = steve_daily / 2\ntotal_daily = steve_daily + girlfriend_daily\ndays_per_week = 7\ntomatoes_per_vine_per_week = 3\n\n# Weekly consumption\ntotal_weekly = total_daily * days_per_week\n\n# Number of vines needed\nvines_needed = total_weekly / tomatoes_per_vine_per_week\n\nprint(vines_needed)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the number of vines needed.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Steve needs 21 vines to meet the weekly tomato consumption for both himself and his girlfriend. This is calculated based on their combined daily consumption and the production rate of each vine.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grows his own cherry tomatoes.
