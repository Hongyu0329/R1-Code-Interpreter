  "question": "Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 1801110 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given:\n\n1. Let \\( r \\) be the number of red chickens.\n2. Let \\( w \\) be the number of white chickens.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.\n- Each white chicken produces 1801110 eggs a day.\n- Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.\n- There are two more white chickens than red chickens, i.e., \\( w = r + 2 \\).\n\nThe total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:\n\\[ 3r + 1801110w = 42 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( w = r + 2 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 3r + 1801110(r + 2) = 42 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for \\( r \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nr = symbols('r')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(3*r + 1801110*(r + 2), 42)\n\n# Solve the equation\nred_chickens = solve(equation, r)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(red_chickens)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the number of red chickens.",
    "The output \\(-\\frac{1200726}{600371}\\) suggests that the number of red chickens is a negative fraction, which is not possible in this context. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem setup or the given numbers are not feasible for a real-world scenario.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem:\n\n1. The equation \\(3r + 1801110(r + 2) = 42\\) implies that the number of eggs produced by the chickens is far greater than the number of eggs collected (42). This discrepancy suggests that the egg production rate for white chickens (1801110 eggs per day) is likely incorrect or unrealistic.\n\n2. Given the current setup, the problem does not have a feasible solution with the provided numbers.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the problem cannot be solved with a realistic number of chickens. If the egg production rates are correct, then the number of eggs collected (42) is not achievable with the given conditions.\n\n<<<The problem setup is not feasible with the given numbers. Please verify the egg production rates or the number of eggs collected.>>>"
