  "question": "Belen has two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 5244240 grains, what is the combined weight of the two pennies?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weight of each penny and then sum them up to find the combined weight.\n\n1. **Weight of the 1959 Penny**: We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 5244240 grains.\n\n2. **Weight of the 2010 Penny**: The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 0.75.\n\n3. **Combined Weight**: Finally, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny to get the combined weight.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given weight of the 1959 penny\nweight_1959_penny = 5244240\n\n# Calculate weight of the 2010 penny\nweight_2010_penny = weight_1959_penny * 0.75\n\n# Calculate combined weight\ncombined_weight = weight_1959_penny + weight_2010_penny\n\n# Output the combined weight\nprint(combined_weight)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the combined weight.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the combined weight of the two pennies is calculated. \n\nThe 1959 penny weighs 5244240 grains, and the 2010 penny, being three-quarters of the 1959 penny, weighs 3933180 grains. Adding these two weights gives us the combined weight.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is:\n\n<<<9177420.0>>>"
