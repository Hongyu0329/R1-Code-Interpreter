# Given number of balls Jason carried
A = 6752769

# Calculate the number of balls Jeffrey carried using integer division
F = A // 2

# Calculate the number of balls Jordan carried
J = 2 * A

# Calculate the total number of balls
total_balls = J + A + F

# Print the total number of balls
print(total_balls)
