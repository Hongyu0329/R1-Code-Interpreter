  "question": "Rozanne is making eggnog for her family. She uses 4 dozen eggs that were in cases and another 2 eggs that were loose in the cupboard. She puts out trays that each hold 5 glasses of eggnog. If each glass needs 5 eggs, how many trays can Rozanne put out?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trays Rozanne can put out based on the number of eggs she has and the number of eggs required per glass of eggnog.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:**\n   - She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) eggs.\n   - She also has 2 additional loose eggs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of eggs is \\(48 + 2 = 50\\) eggs.\n\n2. **Determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made:**\n   - Each glass requires 5 eggs.\n   - The number of glasses that can be made is the total number of eggs divided by the number of eggs per glass, which is \\( \\frac{50}{5} = 10\\) glasses.\n\n3. **Determine how many trays can be put out:**\n   - Each tray holds 5 glasses.\n   - The number of trays that can be put out is the total number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray, which is \\( \\frac{10}{5} = 2\\) trays.\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Number of eggs in dozens and loose\ndozen_eggs = 4\nloose_eggs = 2\n\n# Total eggs\ntotal_eggs = dozen_eggs * 12 + loose_eggs\n\n# Eggs per glass and glasses per tray\neggs_per_glass = 5\nglasses_per_tray = 5\n\n# Calculate number of glasses and trays\ntotal_glasses = total_eggs // eggs_per_glass\ntotal_trays = total_glasses // glasses_per_tray\n\nprint(total_trays)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `2`, which confirms our manual calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
