# Convert Topher's shoe length to inches
topher_shoe_length_feet = 8
topher_shoe_length_inches = 4
topher_shoe_length_total_inches = topher_shoe_length_feet * 12 + topher_shoe_length_inches

# Set up the equation: 9 * bobby_shoe_length + 10 = topher_shoe_length_total_inches
# Solve for bobby_shoe_length
bobby_shoe_length = (topher_shoe_length_total_inches - 10) / 9

# Output the result
print(bobby_shoe_length)
