    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, and this length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.\n\nFirst, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet is equal to \\(8 \\times 12\\) inches. We then add the additional 4 inches to this total.\n\nNext, we set up the equation based on the problem statement:\n\\[ \\text{Length of Topher's shoe} = 9 \\times \\text{Length of Bobby's shoe} + 10 \\]\n\nLet's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \\( x \\) inches. Then, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 9x + 10 = \\text{Length of Topher's shoe in inches} \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation to find \\( x \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Convert Topher's shoe length to inches\ntopher_shoe_length_feet = 8\ntopher_shoe_length_inches = 4\ntopher_shoe_length_total_inches = topher_shoe_length_feet * 12 + topher_shoe_length_inches\n\n# Set up the equation: 9 * bobby_shoe_length + 10 = topher_shoe_length_total_inches\n# Solve for bobby_shoe_length\nbobby_shoe_length = (topher_shoe_length_total_inches - 10) / 9\n\n# Output the result\nprint(bobby_shoe_length)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the length of Bobby's shoe.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10.0>>>"
