    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of baby outfits Laurel has after receiving outfits from different sources. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Laurel initially received 2,212,505 baby outfits from her friend.\n2. At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits. This means she received 2 * 2,212,505 outfits at the baby shower.\n3. Laurel's mom gifted her with an additional 15 baby outfits.\n\nTo find the total number of outfits, we need to sum up all these outfits:\n\n- Outfits from her friend: 2,212,505\n- Outfits from the baby shower: 2 * 2,212,505\n- Outfits from her mom: 15\n\nThe total number of outfits is the sum of these three quantities. Let's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Initial number of outfits from her friend\noutfits_from_friend = 2212505\n\n# Outfits received at the baby shower\noutfits_from_baby_shower = 2 * outfits_from_friend\n\n# Outfits gifted by her mom\noutfits_from_mom = 15\n\n# Total number of outfits\ntotal_outfits = outfits_from_friend + outfits_from_baby_shower + outfits_from_mom\n\n# Output the total number of outfits\nprint(total_outfits)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the total number of baby outfits Laurel has. \n\nThe calculation was done by summing the outfits from her friend, the baby shower, and her mom. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<6637530>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Laurel's friend gave her 2212505 baby outfits that her child no longer needed.
