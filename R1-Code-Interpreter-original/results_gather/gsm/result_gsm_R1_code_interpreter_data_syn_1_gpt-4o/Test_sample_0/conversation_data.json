    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bolts required for the robe. We are given that the robe takes 2,287,720 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of bolts of white fiber. Since the white fiber is half of the blue fiber, we can calculate it as:\n\n\\[ \\text{White fiber bolts} = \\frac{\\text{Blue fiber bolts}}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we add the number of blue fiber bolts and white fiber bolts to get the total number of bolts required.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given data\nblue_fiber_bolts = 2287720\n\n# Calculate white fiber bolts\nwhite_fiber_bolts = blue_fiber_bolts / 2\n\n# Calculate total bolts\ntotal_bolts = blue_fiber_bolts + white_fiber_bolts\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_bolts)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of bolts.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the total number of bolts required for the robe. The calculation involved adding the number of blue fiber bolts and half of that amount for the white fiber bolts.\n\nThe total number of bolts required is 3,431,580.\n\n<<<3431580>>>"
