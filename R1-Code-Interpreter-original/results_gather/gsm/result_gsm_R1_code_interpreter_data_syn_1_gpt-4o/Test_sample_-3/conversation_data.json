    "To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:\n\n1. Let \\( c \\) be the number of chickens and \\( w \\) be the number of cows.\n2. We know that the total number of animals is 3,016,226, so:\n   \\[\n   c + w = 3,016,226\n   \\]\n3. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so:\n   \\[\n   2c + 4w = 70\n   \\]\n\nWe have two equations:\n1. \\( c + w = 3,016,226 \\)\n2. \\( 2c + 4w = 70 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of \\( c \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nFirst, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:\n\\[\nc + 2w = 35\n\\]\n\nNow we have:\n1. \\( c + w = 3,016,226 \\)\n2. \\( c + 2w = 35 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[\n(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 3,016,226\n\\]\n\\[\nw = 35 - 3,016,226\n\\]\n\nThis result is clearly incorrect because it gives a negative number of cows, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem setup and solve it again.\n\nGiven the total number of legs is 70, and the number of animals is 3,016,226, it seems there is a logical inconsistency because the number of legs is too small for such a large number of animals. Let's assume there might be a mistake in the problem statement or a misunderstanding.\n\nLet's solve the equations again to see if we can find a logical solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nc, w = symbols('c w')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(c + w, 3016226)\neq2 = Eq(2*c + 4*w, 70)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (c, w))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if it provides a valid solution.",
    "The solution provided by the code indicates that the number of cows is negative, which is not possible. This suggests that there is a logical inconsistency in the problem statement itself. Given the constraints of 3,016,226 animals and only 70 legs, it is impossible to have a non-negative integer solution for the number of chickens and cows.\n\nThe problem likely contains an error or is a trick question, as the number of legs is far too small for the given number of animals. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine a valid number of chickens.\n\n<<<The problem statement is inconsistent, and it is not possible to determine the number of chickens with the given information.>>>"
