  "question": "The number of students in a school hall was 2780965. The hall had 3 entrances A, B, and C which also served as the exits. If after a meeting 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining went out through exit B, and the rest went out through exit C, calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students who went out through each exit and specifically find out how many went out through exit C.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:**\n   - 30% of the total students went out through exit A.\n   - Total students = 2,780,965\n   - Students through exit A = 30% of 2,780,965\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining students after exit A:**\n   - Remaining students = Total students - Students through exit A\n\n3. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:**\n   - 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.\n   - Students through exit B = 3/5 of remaining students\n\n4. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:**\n   - The rest of the students went out through exit C.\n   - Students through exit C = Remaining students - Students through exit B\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the exact number of students who went out through exit C.\n\n```python\n# Total number of students\ntotal_students = 2780965\n\n# Students through exit A\nstudents_exit_A = 0.30 * total_students\n\n# Remaining students after exit A\nremaining_students_after_A = total_students - students_exit_A\n\n# Students through exit B\nstudents_exit_B = (3/5) * remaining_students_after_A\n\n# Students through exit C\nstudents_exit_C = remaining_students_after_A - students_exit_B\n\n# Output the number of students who went out through exit C\nprint(int(students_exit_C))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of students who went out through exit C.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that 778,670 students went out through exit C. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<778670>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
