    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs each child receives when three dozen eggs are evenly distributed among four children.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the number of dozens into individual eggs. One dozen equals 12 eggs, so three dozen eggs would be:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find out how many eggs each child receives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{36}{4} = 9 \\text{ eggs per child} \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a simple Python script:\n\n```python\n# Total number of eggs\ntotal_eggs = 3 * 12\n\n# Number of children\nchildren = 4\n\n# Eggs per child\neggs_per_child = total_eggs / children\n\nprint(eggs_per_child)\n```\n\nThis script calculates the number of eggs each child receives by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of children. Let's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and returned the expected result. Each child receives 9 eggs. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
