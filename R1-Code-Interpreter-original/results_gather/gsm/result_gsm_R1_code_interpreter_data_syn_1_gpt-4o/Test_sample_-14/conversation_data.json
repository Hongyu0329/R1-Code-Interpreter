    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator:**\n   - Jack and 8 other adults make a total of 9 people.\n   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.\n   - Total weight = Number of people * Average weight per person = 9 * 80 kg.\n\n2. **Compare the total weight to the maximum load capacity:**\n   - Maximum load capacity of the elevator = 700 kg.\n   - If the total weight exceeds 700 kg, calculate by how much it exceeds.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Constants\naverage_weight_per_adult = 80  # kg\nnumber_of_people = 9\nmaximum_load_capacity = 700  # kg\n\n# Calculate total weight\ntotal_weight = number_of_people * average_weight_per_adult\n\n# Calculate excess weight\nexcess_weight = total_weight - maximum_load_capacity\n\n# Output the result\nprint(excess_weight)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution shows that the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load capacity of the elevator by 20 kg. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The elevator in Jack's building supports a maximum load of 700 kg.
