    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of baby outfits Laurel has after receiving outfits from different sources. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Laurel's friend gave her 2,212,505 baby outfits.\n2. At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits. This means she received 2 * 2,212,505 outfits at the baby shower.\n3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.\n\nThe total number of outfits Laurel has is the sum of all these outfits. We can calculate this using a simple arithmetic operation.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of outfits from Laurel's friend\nfriend_outfits = 2212505\n\n# Number of outfits received at the baby shower\nshower_outfits = 2 * friend_outfits\n\n# Number of outfits gifted by Laurel's mom\nmom_outfits = 15\n\n# Total number of outfits\ntotal_outfits = friend_outfits + shower_outfits + mom_outfits\n\n# Output the total number of outfits\nprint(total_outfits)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the total number of baby outfits Laurel has. \n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n- Laurel received 2,212,505 outfits from her friend.\n- At the baby shower, she received twice that amount, which is 2 * 2,212,505 = 4,425,010 outfits.\n- Her mom gifted her an additional 15 outfits.\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of outfits:\n\\[ 2,212,505 + 4,425,010 + 15 = 6,637,530 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is:\n\n<<<6637530>>>"
