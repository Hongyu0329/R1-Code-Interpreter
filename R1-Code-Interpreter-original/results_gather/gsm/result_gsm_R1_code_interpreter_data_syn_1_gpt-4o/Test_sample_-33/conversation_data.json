    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter by summing up the squares of each color.\n\n1. **Red Squares**: We know there are 3,347,396 red squares.\n\n2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Blue Squares} = \\text{Red Squares} + 4 = 3,347,396 + 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Green Squares} = \\text{Blue Squares} + 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{White Squares} = \\text{Green Squares} - 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total Squares**: The total number of squares is the sum of all the colored squares.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given number of red squares\nred_squares = 3347396\n\n# Calculate the number of blue squares\nblue_squares = red_squares + 4\n\n# Calculate the number of green squares\ngreen_squares = blue_squares + 6\n\n# Calculate the number of white squares\nwhite_squares = green_squares - 12\n\n# Calculate the total number of squares\ntotal_squares = red_squares + blue_squares + green_squares + white_squares\n\n# Output the total number of squares\nprint(total_squares)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter. The calculation was based on the given conditions for each color of squares.\n\nThe total number of squares, which corresponds to the total square feet of the comforter, is 13,389,596.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13389596>>>"
