  "question": "Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 360935 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of popcorn kernels that pop during each 30-second interval and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First 30 seconds:**  \n   - Popping rate: 360,935 kernels.\n\n2. **Second 30 seconds:**  \n   - Popping rate: 3 times the initial rate.  \n   - Kernels popped: \\(3 \\times 360,935\\).\n\n3. **Third 30 seconds:**  \n   - Popping rate: 4 times the initial rate.  \n   - Kernels popped: \\(4 \\times 360,935\\).\n\n4. **Fourth 30 seconds:**  \n   - Popping rate: Half of the third interval's rate.  \n   - Kernels popped: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 360,935 = 2 \\times 360,935\\).\n\n5. **Residual popping after heat is removed:**  \n   - Popping rate: A quarter of the fourth interval's rate.  \n   - Kernels popped: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 2 \\times 360,935 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 360,935\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of popped kernels using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Initial popping rate\ninitial_rate = 360935\n\n# Kernels popped in each interval\nfirst_interval = initial_rate\nsecond_interval = 3 * initial_rate\nthird_interval = 4 * initial_rate\nfourth_interval = 2 * initial_rate\nresidual_popping = 0.5 * initial_rate\n\n# Total kernels popped\ntotal_kernels = first_interval + second_interval + third_interval + fourth_interval + residual_popping\n\n# Output the total number of kernels\nprint(total_kernels)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of popped kernels.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of popped kernels as 3,789,817.5. Since the number of kernels must be a whole number, we should round this to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to the nearest whole number, is:\n\n<<<3789818>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack.
