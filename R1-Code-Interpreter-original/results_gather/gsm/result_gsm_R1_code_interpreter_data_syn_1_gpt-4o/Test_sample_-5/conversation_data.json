    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Mark incurs for getting the radiator and having it installed. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the Discounted Price of the Radiator:**\n   - The original price of the radiator is $1,199,484.\n   - He gets an 80% discount on this price.\n   - The discounted price can be calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Discounted Price} = \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Discount Percentage})\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost of Installation:**\n   - The mechanic charges $50 per hour.\n   - The installation takes 3 hours.\n   - The total installation cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Installation Cost} = \\text{Hourly Rate} \\times \\text{Number of Hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - The total cost is the sum of the discounted price of the radiator and the installation cost.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Original price of the radiator\noriginal_price = 1199484\n\n# Discount percentage\ndiscount_percentage = 80 / 100\n\n# Calculate the discounted price\ndiscounted_price = original_price * (1 - discount_percentage)\n\n# Mechanic's hourly rate and hours worked\nhourly_rate = 50\nhours_worked = 3\n\n# Calculate the installation cost\ninstallation_cost = hourly_rate * hours_worked\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = discounted_price + installation_cost\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total amount Mark paid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total cost Mark paid is approximately $240,046.80. \n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n- The discounted price of the radiator was calculated by applying an 80% discount to the original price of $1,199,484.\n- The installation cost was calculated based on the mechanic's hourly rate of $50 for 3 hours.\n- The total cost is the sum of the discounted radiator price and the installation cost.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<240046.80>>>"
