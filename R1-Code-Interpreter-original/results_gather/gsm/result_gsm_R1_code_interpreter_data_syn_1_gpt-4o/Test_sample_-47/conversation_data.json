  "question": "Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 6665653 cakes. Tuesday she went to a different store and bought three times that number of cakes. On Wednesday she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. How many cakes did she buy after all three days?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days.\n\n1. **Monday**: Rose bought 6,665,653 cakes.\n2. **Tuesday**: She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, the number of cakes bought on Tuesday is \\(3 \\times 6,665,653\\).\n3. **Wednesday**: She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, the number of cakes bought on Wednesday is \\(5 \\times\\) the number of cakes bought on Tuesday.\n\nFinally, we sum up the number of cakes bought on each day to get the total number of cakes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of cakes bought on Monday\nmonday_cakes = 6665653\n\n# Number of cakes bought on Tuesday\ntuesday_cakes = 3 * monday_cakes\n\n# Number of cakes bought on Wednesday\nwednesday_cakes = 5 * tuesday_cakes\n\n# Total number of cakes bought over the three days\ntotal_cakes = monday_cakes + tuesday_cakes + wednesday_cakes\n\nprint(total_cakes)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of cakes.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days. \n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n- Monday: 6,665,653 cakes\n- Tuesday: \\(3 \\times 6,665,653 = 19,996,959\\) cakes\n- Wednesday: \\(5 \\times 19,996,959 = 99,984,795\\) cakes\n\nAdding these together gives the total:\n\\[6,665,653 + 19,996,959 + 99,984,795 = 126,647,407\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:\n\n<<<126647407>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 6665653 cakes.
