    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**\n   - Bo has 7,487,762 crabs.\n\n2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**\n   - Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.\n   - Therefore, Monic has \\( 7,487,762 - 4 \\) crabs.\n\n3. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**\n   - Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.\n   - Therefore, Rani has \\( (7,487,762 - 4) + 10 \\) crabs.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of crabs:**\n   - Total crabs = Crabs Bo has + Crabs Monic has + Crabs Rani has.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of crabs Bo has\nbo_crabs = 7487762\n\n# Number of crabs Monic has\nmonic_crabs = bo_crabs - 4\n\n# Number of crabs Rani has\nrani_crabs = monic_crabs + 10\n\n# Total number of crabs\ntotal_crabs = bo_crabs + monic_crabs + rani_crabs\n\nprint(total_crabs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of crabs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together is 22,463,288.\n\n<<<22463288>>>"
