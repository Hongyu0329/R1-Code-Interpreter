    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total age of all the siblings in the family. Here's the breakdown of the information given:\n\n1. There are 2 brothers.\n2. There are 2,620,008 sisters, each 16 years old.\n3. One brother is 12 years old.\n4. The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so he is 24 years old.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total age:\n\n- Total age of the sisters: 2,620,008 sisters * 16 years each\n- Total age of the brothers: 12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother)\n\nWe can write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters and their age\nnum_sisters = 2620008\nage_of_sisters = 16\n\n# Age of the brothers\nage_of_younger_brother = 12\nage_of_older_brother = 24\n\n# Total age calculation\ntotal_age_sisters = num_sisters * age_of_sisters\ntotal_age_brothers = age_of_younger_brother + age_of_older_brother\n\n# Total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_age_sisters + total_age_brothers\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total age of all the siblings.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total age of all the siblings is calculated. The total age is the sum of the ages of all the sisters and both brothers.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n- Total age of the sisters: \\(2,620,008 \\times 16 = 41,920,128\\)\n- Total age of the brothers: \\(12 + 24 = 36\\)\n- Total age of all siblings: \\(41,920,128 + 36 = 41,920,164\\)\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings is:\n\n<<<41920164>>>"
