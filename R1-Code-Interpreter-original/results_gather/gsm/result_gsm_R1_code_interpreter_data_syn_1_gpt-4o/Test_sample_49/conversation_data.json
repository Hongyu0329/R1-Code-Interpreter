  "question": "John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time John spent on vacation and then calculate how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**\n   - Boating: 6 hours\n   - Swimming: Half of boating time = 6 / 2 = 3 hours\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent on these activities:**\n   - Total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours\n\n3. **Determine the total time spent on vacation:**\n   - Watching shows was 30% of the total time spent. Therefore, 6 hours is 30% of the total time.\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the total time spent on vacation. Then, 0.3 * T = 6 hours.\n   - Solve for \\( T \\): \\( T = 6 / 0.3 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing was 40% of the total time.\n   - Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * T.\n\nLet's calculate the total time \\( T \\) and the time spent sightseeing using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given data\ntime_watching_shows = 6  # hours\npercentage_watching_shows = 0.3  # 30%\n\n# Calculate total time spent on vacation\ntotal_time = time_watching_shows / percentage_watching_shows\n\n# Calculate time spent sightseeing\npercentage_sightseeing = 0.4  # 40%\ntime_sightseeing = percentage_sightseeing * total_time\n\nprint(time_sightseeing)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the time John spent sightseeing.",
    "The code execution output indicates that John spent 8.0 hours sightseeing. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8.0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.
