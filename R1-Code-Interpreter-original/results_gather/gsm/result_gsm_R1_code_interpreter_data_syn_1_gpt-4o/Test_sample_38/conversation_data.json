    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. We know the following:\n\n1. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.\n2. When cooked into sauce, the tomatoes lose half their volume.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n- If the sauce loses half its volume, then the original volume of tomatoes used to make 32 ounces of sauce must have been 64 ounces (since 32 ounces is half of 64 ounces).\n- Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, so we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes.\n- Once we know the number of cans, we can calculate the number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by three (since each can contains three tomatoes).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given data\nsauce_volume = 32  # ounces\ncan_volume = 16  # ounces per can\ntomatoes_per_can = 3  # tomatoes per can\n\n# Calculate the original volume of tomatoes before cooking\noriginal_volume = sauce_volume * 2\n\n# Calculate the number of cans needed\nnumber_of_cans = original_volume / can_volume\n\n# Calculate the number of tomatoes used\nnumber_of_tomatoes = number_of_cans * tomatoes_per_can\n\nprint(number_of_tomatoes)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the number of tomatoes Freda used.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that Freda used 12 tomatoes to make her batch of tomato sauce. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
