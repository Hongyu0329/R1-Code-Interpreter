    "\nassistant > To find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Extra-Small (XS):** 5351035 students need size extra-small.\n2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, the number of small shirts needed is \\(2 \\times 5351035\\).\n3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of medium shirts needed is \\((2 \\times 5351035) - 4\\).\n4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of large shirts needed is \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 5351035) - 4}{2}\\).\n5. **Extra-Large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of extra-large shirts needed is \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 5351035) - 4}{2} + 6\\).\n\nFinally, we sum up all the shirts needed for each size to get the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of students needing each size\nextra_small = 5351035\nsmall = 2 * extra_small\nmedium = small - 4\nlarge = medium / 2\nextra_large = large + 6\n\n# Total number of shirts\ntotal_shirts = extra_small + small + medium + large + extra_large\ntotal_shirts\nassistant > Krissa needs to order a total of <<<37457243>>> shirts."
