The age of each sister is 16 years, and there are 2,620,008 sisters.\n2. One brother is 12 years old.\n3. The older brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother, so he is 24 years old.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total age:\n\n- Total age of all sisters = 16 years * 2,620,008 sisters\n- Total age of the younger brother = 12 years\n- Total age of the older brother = 24 years\n\nLet's calculate the total age.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of sisters and their age\nnum_sisters = 2620008\nage_sisters = 16\n\n# Age of the brothers\nage_younger_brother = 12\nage_older_brother = 24\n\n# Calculate total age\ntotal_age_sisters = num_sisters * age_sisters\ntotal_age_brothers = age_younger_brother + age_older_brother\n\n# Total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_age_sisters + total_age_brothers\ntotal_age\nassistant > The total age of all the siblings is <<<41920164>>>."
