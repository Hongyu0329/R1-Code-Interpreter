Monthly cost to rent a hangar: $8,578,246\n3. Monthly cost for fuel: Twice the hangar cost, which is \\(2 \\times 8,578,246\\)\n\nThe total cost for the first year will be the sum of the initial cost of the plane and the monthly costs for the hangar and fuel over 12 months.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial cost of the plane\ninitial_cost = 150000\n\n# Monthly cost to rent a hangar\nhangar_cost_per_month = 8578246\n\n# Monthly cost for fuel (twice the hangar cost)\nfuel_cost_per_month = 2 * hangar_cost_per_month\n\n# Total cost for the first year\ntotal_cost_first_year = (\n    initial_cost +\n    12 * (hangar_cost_per_month + fuel_cost_per_month)\n)\n\ntotal_cost_first_year\nassistant > The total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is <<<308966856>>>."
