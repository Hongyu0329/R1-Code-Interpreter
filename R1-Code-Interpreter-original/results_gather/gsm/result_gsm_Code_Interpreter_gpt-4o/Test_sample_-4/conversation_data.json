    "\nassistant > Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. John spends 6 hours boating.\n2. He spends half of that time swimming, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours.\n3. He watches 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours watching shows.\n4. The time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation.\n\nLet's calculate the total time he spent on vacation using the information that watching shows was 30% of his total time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{\\text{Time spent watching shows}}{0.30} = \\frac{6}{0.30}\n\\]\n\n5. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. We can calculate the time spent sightseeing as 40% of the total time.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given values\ntime_boating = 6\ntime_swimming = time_boating / 2\ntime_watching_shows = 3 * 2\npercentage_watching_shows = 0.30\npercentage_sightseeing = 0.40\n\n# Calculate total time spent on vacation\ntotal_time = time_watching_shows / percentage_watching_shows\n\n# Calculate time spent sightseeing\ntime_sightseeing = total_time * percentage_sightseeing\ntime_sightseeing\nassistant > John spent <<<8.0>>> hours sightseeing."
