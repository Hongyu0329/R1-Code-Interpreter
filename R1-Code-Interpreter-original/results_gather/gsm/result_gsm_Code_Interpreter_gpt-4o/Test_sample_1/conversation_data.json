    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the information given, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours.\n\n1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**\n   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.\n   - Her skipping speed is half of her running speed.\n   - Therefore, her running speed is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) miles per hour.\n\n2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**\n   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.\n   - Therefore, her walking speed is \\(6 \\div 4 = 1.5\\) miles per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**\n   - Total time = 6 hours.\n   - Time spent running = \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2\\) hours.\n   - Time spent walking = \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4\\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the distance traveled:**\n   - Distance running = Running speed \\(\\times\\) Time running = \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) miles.\n   - Distance walking = Walking speed \\(\\times\\) Time walking = \\(1.5 \\times 4 = 6\\) miles.\n\n5. **Total distance traveled:**\n   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = \\(12 + 6 = 18\\) miles.\n\nTherefore, Dana can travel a total of 18 miles in six hours. \n\nThe final answer is: <<<18>>>."
