    "\nassistant > To find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we can calculate the number of students needing each size and then sum them up.\n\n1. Extra-small: 5,351,035 students\n2. Small: Twice as many as extra-small, so \\(2 \\times 5,351,035\\)\n3. Medium: Four less than the number of small students, so \\((2 \\times 5,351,035) - 4\\)\n4. Large: Half as many as medium, so \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 5,351,035) - 4}{2}\\)\n5. Extra-large: Six more than large, so \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 5,351,035) - 4}{2} + 6\\)\n\nLet's calculate the total number of shirts.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of students needing each size\nextra_small = 5351035\nsmall = 2 * extra_small\nmedium = small - 4\nlarge = medium / 2\nextra_large = large + 6\n\n# Total number of shirts\ntotal_shirts = extra_small + small + medium + large + extra_large\ntotal_shirts\nassistant > The total number of shirts Krissa needs to order is <<<37457243>>>."
