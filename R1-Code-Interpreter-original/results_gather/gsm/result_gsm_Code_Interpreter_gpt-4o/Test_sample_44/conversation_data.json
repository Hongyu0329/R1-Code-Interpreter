Add 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, this adds \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) shoes.\n3. Add 15 pairs of shoes on Wednesday. This adds \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\) shoes.\n4. Add 30 pairs of shoes on Friday. This adds \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\) shoes.\n5. Subtract 180 shoes on Saturday.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial number of shoes\ninitial_shoes = 3495007\n\n# Shoes added on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\nmonday_addition = 5 * 2\nwednesday_addition = 15 * 2\nfriday_addition = 30 * 2\n\n# Shoes removed on Saturday\nsaturday_removal = 180\n\n# Total shoes on Sunday\ntotal_shoes_sunday = (initial_shoes + monday_addition + wednesday_addition + friday_addition - saturday_removal)\ntotal_shoes_sunday\nassistant > Fireman Frank will have <<<3494927>>> shoes on Sunday."
