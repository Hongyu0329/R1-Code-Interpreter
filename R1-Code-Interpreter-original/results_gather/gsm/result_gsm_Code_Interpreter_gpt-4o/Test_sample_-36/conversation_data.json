    "\nassistant > To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her activities and then use the given ratio to find the required amount of water.\n\n1. **Calculate Calories Burned:**\n   - Aerobics: 2 hours × 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories\n   - Running: 1 hour × 600 calories/hour = 600 calories\n   - Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories\n\n2. **Calculate Water Needed:**\n   - Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.\n   - Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) × 100 ml\n\nLet's calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\ncalories_per_200ml = 200\nwater_per_200calories = 100  # in ml\n\n# Calories burned\ncalories_aerobics = 2 * 500  # 2 hours of aerobics\ncalories_running = 1 * 600   # 1 hour of running\ntotal_calories = calories_aerobics + calories_running\n\n# Calculate water needed\nwater_needed_ml = (total_calories / calories_per_200ml) * water_per_200calories\nwater_needed_ml\nassistant > Hannah needs to drink <<<800.0>>> ml of water."
