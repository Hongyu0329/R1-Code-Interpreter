    "\nassistant > To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend consume per week.\n\n1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), he eats:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ tomatoes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats half of what he eats per day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ tomatoes per day}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, in a week, she eats:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 7 = 21 \\text{ tomatoes}\n   \\]\n\n3. Together, they consume:\n   \\[\n   42 + 21 = 63 \\text{ tomatoes per week}\n   \\]\n\n4. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find the number of vines needed, we divide the total weekly consumption by the production per vine:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{63}{3} = 21 \\text{ vines}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Steve needs 21 vines. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<21>>>}\n\\]"
