    "\nassistant > To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of stripes on all zebras.\n2. Divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \\(2 \\times 17 = 34\\) stripes.\n2. One zebra with 3,009,606 stripes.\n3. Another zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes: \\(\\frac{3,009,606}{2}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of stripes and then find the average.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of stripes for each zebra\nstripes_zebra1 = 17\nstripes_zebra2 = 17\nstripes_zebra3 = 3009606\nstripes_zebra4 = 3009606 / 2\n\n# Total number of stripes\ntotal_stripes = stripes_zebra1 + stripes_zebra2 + stripes_zebra3 + stripes_zebra4\n\n# Number of zebras\nnumber_of_zebras = 4\n\n# Average number of stripes\naverage_stripes = total_stripes / number_of_zebras\naverage_stripes\nassistant > The average number of stripes on the zebras is <<<1128610.75>>>."
