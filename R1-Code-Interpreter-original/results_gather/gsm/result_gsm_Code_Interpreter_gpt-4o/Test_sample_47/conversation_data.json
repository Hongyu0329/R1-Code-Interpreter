    "\nassistant > Let's denote the number of red chickens as \\( r \\) and the number of white chickens as \\( w \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.\n2. Each white chicken produces 1801110 eggs a day.\n3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.\n4. There are two more white chickens than red chickens, i.e., \\( w = r + 2 \\).\n\nThe total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:\n\\[ 3r + 1801110w = 42 \\]\n\nWe can substitute \\( w = r + 2 \\) into the equation and solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[ 3r + 1801110(r + 2) = 42 \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation to find the number of red chickens, \\( r \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nr = symbols('r')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(3*r + 1801110*(r + 2), 42)\n\n# Solve the equation\nred_chickens = solve(equation, r)\nred_chickens\nassistant > The solution for the number of red chickens is \\(-\\frac{1200726}{600371}\\), which is approximately \\(-2.0\\). However, having a negative number of chickens doesn't make sense in this context. Let's re-evaluate the problem setup to ensure there are no errors in the given values or assumptions. \n\nThe problem states that white chickens produce 1801110 eggs a day, which seems unusually high. Could there be a mistake in the problem statement?"
