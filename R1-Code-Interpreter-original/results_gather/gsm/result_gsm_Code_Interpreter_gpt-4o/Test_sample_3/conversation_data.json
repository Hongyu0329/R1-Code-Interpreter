    "\nassistant > To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them ate and then find the average.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate:\n   - Beatrice's roll-ups: 549047 wide × 24 long\n\n2. Calculate the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate:\n   - Marcell's roll-ups: 3 wide × 14 long\n\n3. Find the average by adding the total number of roll-ups eaten by both and dividing by 2.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by Beatrice and Marcell\nbeatrice_roll_ups = 549047 * 24\nmarcell_roll_ups = 3 * 14\n\n# Calculate the average\naverage_roll_ups = (beatrice_roll_ups + marcell_roll_ups) / 2\naverage_roll_ups\nassistant > The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is <<<6588585.0>>>."
