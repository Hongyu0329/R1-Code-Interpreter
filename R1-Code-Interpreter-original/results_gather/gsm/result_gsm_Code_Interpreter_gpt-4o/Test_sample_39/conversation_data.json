    "\nassistant > To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then compare it to the elevator's maximum load.\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults:\n   - Number of people: 1 (Jack) + 8 (other adults) = 9 people\n   - Average weight per person: 80 kg\n   - Total weight = 9 people * 80 kg/person\n\n2. Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum load of 700 kg.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\nmax_load = 700  # kg\naverage_weight_per_person = 80  # kg\nnumber_of_people = 9  # Jack + 8 other adults\n\n# Calculate total weight of the group\ntotal_weight = number_of_people * average_weight_per_person\n\n# Calculate the excess weight\nexcess_weight = total_weight - max_load\nexcess_weight\nassistant > The group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by <<<20>>> kg."
