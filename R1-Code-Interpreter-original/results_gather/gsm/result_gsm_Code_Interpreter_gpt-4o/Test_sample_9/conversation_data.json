    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds Joey loses in one week and then calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.\n\n1. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 2 \\text{ pounds per week}\n   \\]\n\n2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.\n\n3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{2 \\text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose 8 pounds\njoey_weekly_loss = 8 / 4  # Joey's weekly weight loss\nsandy_weeks_for_joey_weekly_loss = 4  # Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in 1 week\n\n# Total weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds\nsandy_total_weeks = (8 / joey_weekly_loss) * sandy_weeks_for_joey_weekly_loss\nsandy_total_weeks\nassistant > It will take Sandy <<<16.0>>> weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks."
