    "\nassistant > To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then compare it to the elevator's maximum load.\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults:\n   - Number of adults = 9 (Jack + 8 others)\n   - Average weight per adult = 80 kg\n   - Total weight = 9 * 80 kg\n\n2. Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum load:\n   - Maximum load = 700 kg\n   - Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\naverage_weight_per_adult = 80  # kg\nnumber_of_adults = 9  # Jack + 8 others\nmaximum_load = 700  # kg\n\n# Calculate total weight of the group\ntotal_weight = number_of_adults * average_weight_per_adult\n\n# Calculate excess weight\nexcess_weight = total_weight - maximum_load\nexcess_weight\nassistant > The group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by <<<20>>> kg."
