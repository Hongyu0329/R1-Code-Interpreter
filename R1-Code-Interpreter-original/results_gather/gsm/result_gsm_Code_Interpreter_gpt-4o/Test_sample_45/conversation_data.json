    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of robots, helmets, and footballs based on the given relationships and then sum them up.\n\n1. We know there are 20 helmets.\n2. There are half as many robots as helmets, so the number of robots is \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\).\n3. There are half as many helmets as footballs, so the number of footballs is \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of items:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total items} = \\text{robots} + \\text{helmets} + \\text{footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given values\nhelmets = 20\n\n# Calculate number of robots and footballs\nrobots = helmets / 2\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\n# Calculate total number of items\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\ntotal_items\nassistant > The total number of items Dominick saw is <<<70.0>>>."
