    "\nassistant > To determine how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Finally, we will calculate how many trays she can fill with those glasses.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs:\n   - 4 dozen eggs = 4 * 12 = 48 eggs\n   - Plus 2 loose eggs\n   - Total eggs = 48 + 2 = 50 eggs\n\n2. Calculate the number of glasses of eggnog she can make:\n   - Each glass requires 5 eggs\n   - Number of glasses = Total eggs / Eggs per glass = 50 / 5 = 10 glasses\n\n3. Calculate the number of trays:\n   - Each tray holds 5 glasses\n   - Number of trays = Number of glasses / Glasses per tray = 10 / 5 = 2 trays\n\nTherefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays. \n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>."
