    "\nassistant > To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are required for 2,182,736 kg of coal and then multiply that by the cost per bag.\n\n1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bags} = \\frac{\\text{Total weight of coal}}{\\text{Weight per bag}} = \\frac{2,182,736 \\text{ kg}}{50 \\text{ kg/bag}}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Number of bags} \\times \\text{Cost per bag} = \\text{Number of bags} \\times 18\n   \\]\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\ntotal_weight_kg = 2182736\nweight_per_bag_kg = 50\ncost_per_bag = 18\n\n# Calculate the number of bags needed\nnumber_of_bags = total_weight_kg / weight_per_bag_kg\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = number_of_bags * cost_per_bag\ntotal_cost\nassistant > The total cost of Ali's order is <<<785784.96>>>."
