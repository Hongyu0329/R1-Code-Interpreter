    "\nassistant > Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Boating Time**: John spends 6 hours boating.\n2. **Swimming Time**: He spends half the time of boating swimming, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours.\n3. **Watching Shows**: He watches 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours watching shows.\n4. **Total Time for Watching Shows**: This is 30% of the total time he spent. Let \\( T \\) be the total time he spent. Then, \\( 0.3T = 6 \\).\n5. **Sightseeing Time**: He spends 40% of his time sightseeing, which is \\( 0.4T \\).\n\nFirst, we need to find the total time \\( T \\) he spent, and then calculate the time spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\ntime_watching_shows = 6  # hours\npercentage_watching_shows = 0.3  # 30%\n\n# Calculate total time spent\ntotal_time_spent = time_watching_shows / percentage_watching_shows\n\n# Calculate time spent sightseeing\npercentage_sightseeing = 0.4  # 40%\ntime_sightseeing = percentage_sightseeing * total_time_spent\n\ntotal_time_spent, time_sightseeing\nassistant > John spent a total of 20 hours on his vacation. Therefore, the time he spent sightseeing is \\(0.4 \\times 20 = 8\\) hours.\n\nThe time he spent sightseeing is <<<8.0>>>."
