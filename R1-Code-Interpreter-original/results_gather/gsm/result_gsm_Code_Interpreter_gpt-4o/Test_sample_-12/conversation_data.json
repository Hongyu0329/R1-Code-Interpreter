    "\nassistant > To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total population of the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and there are 560,233 boys. \n\nLet's denote the total population of the school as \\( P \\). According to the problem, 40% of \\( P \\) is equal to 560,233. We can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times P = 560233 \\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{560233}{0.40} \\]\n\nOnce we have the total population \\( P \\), we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls} = P - 560233 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\nboys = 560233\npercentage_boys = 0.40\n\n# Calculate total population\ntotal_population = boys / percentage_boys\n\n# Calculate number of girls\ngirls = total_population - boys\ngirls\nassistant > The number of girls in the school is approximately \\( 840,349.5 \\). Since the number of girls must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} \\approx 840,350\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<840350>>>."
