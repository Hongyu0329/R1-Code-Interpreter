    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of robots, helmets, and footballs based on the given relationships:\n\n1. There are 20 helmets.\n2. There are half as many robots as helmets.\n3. There are half as many helmets as footballs.\n\nLet's calculate the number of robots and footballs, and then sum them up along with the helmets to find the total number of items.\n\n- Number of helmets = 20\n- Number of robots = 20 / 2 = 10\n- Number of footballs = 20 * 2 = 40\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of items:\n\nTotal items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs\n\nLet's compute this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\nhelmets = 20\n\n# Calculating number of robots and footballs\nrobots = helmets / 2\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\n# Calculating total number of items\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\ntotal_items\nassistant > The total number of items Dominick saw is <<<70.0>>>."
