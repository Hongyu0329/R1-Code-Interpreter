    "\nassistant > To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his mother and father, and then subtract the cost of the trousers from this total.\n\n1. Adam's mother gave him $1,806,882.\n2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \\(2 \\times 1,806,882\\).\n3. The total amount given by his parents is the sum of the amounts from his mother and father.\n4. The cost of the trousers is $30.\n5. The amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is the cost of the trousers minus the total amount given by his parents.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given values\nmother_contribution = 1806882\nfather_contribution = 2 * mother_contribution\ntrousers_cost = 30\n\n# Total contribution from parents\ntotal_contribution = mother_contribution + father_contribution\n\n# Amount Adam had to contribute from his savings\nadam_contribution = trousers_cost - total_contribution\nadam_contribution\nassistant > Adam did not need to contribute any money from his savings. In fact, he had an excess amount after buying the trousers. The amount he had left over is \\(-5,420,616\\), indicating that he had more than enough money from his parents to cover the cost of the trousers.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-5420616>>>."
