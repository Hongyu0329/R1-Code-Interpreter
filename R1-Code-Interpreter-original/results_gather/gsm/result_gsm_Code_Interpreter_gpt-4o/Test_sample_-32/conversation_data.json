  "question": "Topher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby’s shoes?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "\nassistant > To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to set up an equation based on the information given:\n\n1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 8 feet and 4 inches is equal to \\(8 \\times 12 + 4\\) inches.\n\n2. Let \\(b\\) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   9b + 10 = \\text{Length of Topher's shoe in inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\(b\\).\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Convert Topher's shoe length to inches\ntopher_shoe_length_inches = 8 * 12 + 4\n\n# Solve for Bobby's shoe length\nbobby_shoe_length = (topher_shoe_length_inches - 10) / 9\nbobby_shoe_length\nassistant > The length of one of Bobby's shoes is <<<10.0>>> inches."
