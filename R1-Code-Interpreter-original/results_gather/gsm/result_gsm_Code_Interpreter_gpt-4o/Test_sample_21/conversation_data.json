    "\nassistant > To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to set up an equation based on the information given:\n\n1. Let \\( B \\) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.\n2. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[ T = 9B + 10 \\]\n\nWe know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. First, we need to convert this measurement entirely into inches:\n\n1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 inches.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total length in inches and solve for \\( B \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Convert Topher's shoe length to inches\nfeet_to_inches = 8 * 12\ntotal_inches = feet_to_inches + 4\n\n# Solve for Bobby's shoe length\n# T = 9B + 10\n# B = (T - 10) / 9\nB = (total_inches - 10) / 9\nB\nassistant > The length of one of Bobby's shoes is <<<10.0>>> inches."
