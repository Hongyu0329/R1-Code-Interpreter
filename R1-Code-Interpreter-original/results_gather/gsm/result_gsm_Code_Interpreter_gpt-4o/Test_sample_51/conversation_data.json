    "\nassistant > To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend consume per week.\n\n1. **Steve's Consumption:**\n   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.\n   - Therefore, in a week (7 days), he eats: \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ tomatoes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Girlfriend's Consumption:**\n   - Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats per day.\n   - Therefore, she eats: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ tomatoes per day}\n     \\]\n   - In a week, she eats:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 7 = 21 \\text{ tomatoes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Weekly Consumption:**\n   - Combined, they eat:\n     \\[\n     42 + 21 = 63 \\text{ tomatoes per week}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Vines Required:**\n   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.\n   - To find the number of vines needed, divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{63}{3} = 21 \\text{ vines}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly tomato consumption. \n\nThe final answer is: <<<21>>>."
