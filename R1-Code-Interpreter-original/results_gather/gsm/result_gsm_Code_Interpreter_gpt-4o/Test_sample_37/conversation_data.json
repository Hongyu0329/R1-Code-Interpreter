The age of the older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, which is \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) years.\n3. Each of the 2,620,008 sisters is 16 years old.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total age:\n\n- Total age of the brothers: \\(12 + 24\\)\n- Total age of the sisters: \\(2620008 \\times 16\\)\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the total age of all siblings. Let's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\nyounger_brother_age = 12\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\nsister_age = 16\nnumber_of_sisters = 2620008\n\n# Total age calculation\ntotal_brothers_age = younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\ntotal_sisters_age = number_of_sisters * sister_age\ntotal_age = total_brothers_age + total_sisters_age\n\ntotal_age\nassistant > The total age of all the siblings is <<<41920164>>>."
