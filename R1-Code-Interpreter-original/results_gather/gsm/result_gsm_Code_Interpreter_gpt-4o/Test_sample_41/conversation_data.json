    "\nassistant > To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total population of the school. Since 40% of the school population is made up of boys, we can use this information to calculate the total population and then find the number of girls.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( B \\) as the number of boys, which is 560,233.\n- \\( T \\) as the total population of the school.\n- \\( G \\) as the number of girls.\n\nGiven that 40% of the school population is boys, we have:\n\\[ 0.4 \\times T = B \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( T \\) and then find \\( G \\) using:\n\\[ G = T - B \\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\nboys = 560233\npercentage_boys = 0.4\n\n# Calculate total population\ntotal_population = boys / percentage_boys\n\n# Calculate number of girls\ngirls = total_population - boys\ngirls\nassistant > The number of girls in the school is approximately \\( 840,349.5 \\). Since the number of girls must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 840,350.\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<840350>>>."
