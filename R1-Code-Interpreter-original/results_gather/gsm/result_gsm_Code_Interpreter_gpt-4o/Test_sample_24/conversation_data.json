    "\nassistant > To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each type of egg and then sum them up.\n\n1. Green eggs: 7248186\n2. Blue eggs: Twice as many as green eggs, so \\(2 \\times 7248186\\)\n3. Pink eggs: One fewer than blue eggs, so \\(2 \\times 7248186 - 1\\)\n4. Yellow eggs: One-third as many as pink eggs, so \\(\\frac{2 \\times 7248186 - 1}{3}\\)\n\nLet's calculate the total number of eggs.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of green eggs\ngreen_eggs = 7248186\n\n# Number of blue eggs\nblue_eggs = 2 * green_eggs\n\n# Number of pink eggs\npink_eggs = blue_eggs - 1\n\n# Number of yellow eggs\nyellow_eggs = pink_eggs / 3\n\n# Total number of eggs\ntotal_eggs = green_eggs + blue_eggs + pink_eggs + yellow_eggs\ntotal_eggs\nassistant > The total number of eggs Cindy had is approximately 41073052.67.
