    "\nassistant > To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the volume of sauce made from one can of tomatoes:\n   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.\n   - When cooked into sauce, they lose half their volume, so each can makes \\( \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\) ounces of sauce.\n\n2. Calculate how many cans were used to make 32 ounces of sauce:\n   - Since each can makes 8 ounces of sauce, the number of cans used is \\( \\frac{32}{8} = 4 \\).\n\n3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used:\n   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so 4 cans contain \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) tomatoes.\n\nTherefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes. The final answer is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
