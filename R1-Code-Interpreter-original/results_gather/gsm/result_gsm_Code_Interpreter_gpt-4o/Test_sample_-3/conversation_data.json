    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:\n\n1. Let \\( c \\) be the number of chickens and \\( w \\) be the number of cows.\n2. We know that the total number of animals is 3,016,226, so:\n   \\[\n   c + w = 3,016,226\n   \\]\n3. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so:\n   \\[\n   2c + 4w = 70\n   \\]\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the number of chickens. Let's do that now.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nc, w = symbols('c w')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(c + w, 3016226)\neq2 = Eq(2*c + 4*w, 70)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (c, w))\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of equations gives us \\( c = 6,032,417 \\) and \\( w = -3,016,191 \\). However, having a negative number of cows is not feasible in this context. This indicates that the problem constraints are not consistent with the given total number of animals and legs.\n\nGiven the total number of legs (70) is far too small for the number of animals (3,016,226), it seems there might be an error in the problem statement. Under normal circumstances, with such a large number of animals, the total number of legs would be significantly higher.\n\nIf you have any additional information or corrections to the problem, please let me know!"
