    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of calories Hannah burns and then determine how much water she needs to drink based on that.\n\n1. **Calculate Calories Burned:**\n   - Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories\n   - Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories\n   - Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories\n\n2. **Calculate Water Needed:**\n   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.\n   - Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml\n\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.\n\n<<<800>>>"
