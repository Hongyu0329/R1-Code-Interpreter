    "To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to consider the total number of women wearing heels and the total height contributed by all the heels.\n\n1. **Identify the number of women and heel heights:**\n   - 3 women are wearing 4-inch heels.\n   - 8,449,158 women are wearing 2-inch heels.\n\n2. **Calculate the total height of all heels:**\n   - Total height from 4-inch heels = 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches.\n   - Total height from 2-inch heels = 8,449,158 women * 2 inches = 16,898,316 inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of women:**\n   - Total number of women = 3 + 8,449,158 = 8,449,161 women.\n\n4. **Calculate the average height of heels:**\n   - Average height = (Total height of all heels) / (Total number of women).\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of women wearing each type of heel\nwomen_4_inch = 3\nwomen_2_inch = 8449158\n\n# Total height contributed by each type of heel\ntotal_height_4_inch = women_4_inch * 4\ntotal_height_2_inch = women_2_inch * 2\n\n# Total height of all heels\ntotal_height = total_height_4_inch + total_height_2_inch\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = women_4_inch + women_2_inch\n\n# Average height of heels\naverage_height = total_height / total_women\n\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the average height of the heels at the party.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the average height of heels is approximately 2.0000007101296804 inches. This result is expected because the vast majority of women at the party are wearing 2-inch heels, which heavily influences the average.\n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n- The total height contributed by the 3 women wearing 4-inch heels is 12 inches.\n- The total height contributed by the 8,449,158 women wearing 2-inch heels is 16,898,316 inches.\n- The total number of women is 8,449,161.\n- The average height of heels is calculated as the total height divided by the total number of women, resulting in approximately 2.0000007101296804 inches.\n\nThis result is correct given the data provided. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2.0000007101296804>>>"
