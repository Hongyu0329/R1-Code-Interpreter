    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trays Rozanne can put out based on the number of eggs she has and the number of eggs required per glass of eggnog.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:**\n   - She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) eggs.\n   - She also uses 2 additional loose eggs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of eggs is \\(48 + 2 = 50\\) eggs.\n\n2. **Determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made:**\n   - Each glass requires 5 eggs.\n   - The number of glasses that can be made is the total number of eggs divided by the number of eggs per glass, which is \\( \\frac{50}{5} = 10\\) glasses.\n\n3. **Determine how many trays can be put out:**\n   - Each tray holds 5 glasses.\n   - The number of trays is the number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray, which is \\( \\frac{10}{5} = 2\\) trays.\n\nThus, Rozanne can put out 2 trays. \n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"
