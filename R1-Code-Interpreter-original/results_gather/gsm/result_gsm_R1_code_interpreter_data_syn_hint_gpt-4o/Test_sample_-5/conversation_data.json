    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Mark incurs for getting the radiator and having it installed.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount:**\n   - The original cost of the radiator is $1,199,484.\n   - He gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.\n   - The cost after discount = 20% of $1,199,484.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of installation:**\n   - The mechanic charges $50 per hour.\n   - The installation takes 3 hours.\n   - Total installation cost = 3 hours * $50/hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator after discount + Installation cost.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Original cost of the radiator\noriginal_cost = 1199484\n\n# Discount percentage\ndiscount_percentage = 80\n\n# Cost after discount\ncost_after_discount = original_cost * (1 - discount_percentage / 100)\n\n# Mechanic's hourly rate\nhourly_rate = 50\n\n# Hours taken for installation\nhours = 3\n\n# Installation cost\ninstallation_cost = hourly_rate * hours\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_after_discount + installation_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total amount Mark paid.",
    "The code execution result shows that the total cost Mark paid is approximately $240,046.80. This result is derived from the following calculations:\n\n1. **Cost of the radiator after discount:**\n   - Original cost: $1,199,484\n   - Discount: 80%\n   - Cost after discount = 20% of $1,199,484 = $239,896.80\n\n2. **Installation cost:**\n   - Mechanic's rate: $50/hour\n   - Hours: 3\n   - Installation cost = 3 * $50 = $150\n\n3. **Total cost:**\n   - Total cost = $239,896.80 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $240,046.80\n\nThe code correctly calculates these values, and the total cost Mark paid is $240,046.80.\n\n<<<240046.80>>>"
