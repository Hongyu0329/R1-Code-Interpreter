    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges Jennifer has left after distributing them to her children.\n\n1. **Initial Count**: Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.\n2. **Distribution to Daughters**: She gave each of her three daughters 2 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given to her daughters is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) oranges.\n3. **Distribution to Son**: Her only boy received 1,277,771 oranges.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of oranges distributed to all her children:\n\n- Total oranges given to daughters: 6\n- Total oranges given to son: 1,277,771\n\nThe total number of oranges distributed is \\(6 + 1,277,771 = 1,277,777\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate how many oranges Jennifer has left:\n\n- Initial oranges: 12\n- Oranges distributed: 1,277,777\n\nThe number of oranges Jennifer remains with is \\(12 - 1,277,777\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\ninitial_oranges = 12\noranges_to_daughters = 3 * 2\noranges_to_son = 1277771\n\ntotal_oranges_distributed = oranges_to_daughters + oranges_to_son\noranges_remaining = initial_oranges - total_oranges_distributed\n\nprint(oranges_remaining)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the number of oranges Jennifer has left.",
    "The code execution result indicates that Jennifer has \\(-1,277,765\\) oranges remaining, which is a negative number. This suggests that the number of oranges given to her son (1,277,771) is far greater than the number of oranges she initially had (12). \n\nThis implies that the problem statement might be unrealistic or contains an error, as it is not possible for Jennifer to give away more oranges than she initially possessed.\n\nGiven the problem as stated, the calculation is correct, and Jennifer would indeed have a negative number of oranges remaining, which is not feasible in a real-world scenario.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, based on the problem statement, is:\n\n<<<-1277765>>>"
