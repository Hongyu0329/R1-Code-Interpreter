    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time John spent on vacation and then calculate how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**\n   - Boating: 6 hours\n   - Swimming: Half of boating time = 6 / 2 = 3 hours\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent on these activities:**\n   - Total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours\n\n3. **Determine the total time spent on vacation:**\n   - The time spent watching shows (6 hours) is 30% of the total vacation time.\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the total vacation time. Then, 0.3 * T = 6 hours.\n   - Solving for \\( T \\), we get \\( T = 6 / 0.3 = 20 \\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing time is 40% of the total vacation time.\n   - Sightseeing time = 0.4 * T = 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours\n\nThus, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.\n\n<<<8>>>"
