    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost James incurs in the first year for buying and maintaining the plane. The costs include:\n\n1. The initial cost of buying the plane.\n2. The monthly cost of renting the hanger.\n3. The monthly cost of fuel.\n\nLet's break down the costs:\n\n1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000\n\n2. **Monthly Hanger Rent**: $8,578,246\n\n3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: Twice the hanger rent, which is \\(2 \\times 8,578,246 = 17,156,492\\)\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for the first year:\n\n- Total hanger rent for the year: \\(8,578,246 \\times 12\\)\n- Total fuel cost for the year: \\(17,156,492 \\times 12\\)\n\nFinally, we sum up all these costs to get the total cost for the first year.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial cost of the plane\ninitial_cost = 150000\n\n# Monthly costs\nhanger_rent = 8578246\nfuel_cost = 2 * hanger_rent\n\n# Total costs for the year\ntotal_hanger_rent = hanger_rent * 12\ntotal_fuel_cost = fuel_cost * 12\n\n# Total cost for the first year\ntotal_cost_first_year = initial_cost + total_hanger_rent + total_fuel_cost\n\nprint(total_cost_first_year)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total cost for the first year.",
    "The code execution result shows that the total cost for the first year is $308,966,856. This includes the initial cost of the plane, the hanger rent for 12 months, and the fuel cost for 12 months.\n\nLet's summarize the calculation:\n\n1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000\n2. **Total Hanger Rent for the Year**: $8,578,246 per month × 12 months = $102,938,952\n3. **Total Fuel Cost for the Year**: $17,156,492 per month × 12 months = $205,877,904\n\nAdding these together gives the total cost for the first year:\n\n\\[ 150,000 + 102,938,952 + 205,877,904 = 308,966,856 \\]\n\nThis confirms the result from the code execution.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:\n\n<<<308966856>>>"
