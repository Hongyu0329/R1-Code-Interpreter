# Calculate total cost for baseballs
cost_per_baseball = 9414724
number_of_baseballs = 9
total_cost_baseballs = number_of_baseballs * cost_per_baseball

# Calculate total cost for basketballs
cost_per_basketball = 14
number_of_basketballs = 8
total_cost_basketballs = number_of_basketballs * cost_per_basketball

# Calculate the difference
difference = total_cost_basketballs - total_cost_baseballs
