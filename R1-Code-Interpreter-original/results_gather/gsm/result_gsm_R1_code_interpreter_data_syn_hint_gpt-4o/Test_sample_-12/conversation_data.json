    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total population of the school and then calculate the number of girls.\n\n1. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and the number of boys is 560,233.\n2. Let the total population of the school be \\( P \\).\n3. According to the problem, 40% of \\( P \\) is 560,233. We can express this as:\n   \\[\n   0.4 \\times P = 560233\n   \\]\n4. To find \\( P \\), we rearrange the equation:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{560233}{0.4}\n   \\]\n5. Once we have the total population \\( P \\), we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = P - 560233\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given data\nboys = 560233\npercentage_boys = 0.4\n\n# Calculate total population\ntotal_population = boys / percentage_boys\n\n# Calculate number of girls\ngirls = total_population - boys\n\n# Output the number of girls\nprint(int(girls))\n```",
    "The code execution result indicates that the number of girls in the school is 840,349. This result is consistent with the calculations we performed:\n\n1. We calculated the total population of the school by dividing the number of boys by the percentage they represent (40%).\n2. We then subtracted the number of boys from the total population to find the number of girls.\n\nThe calculations are straightforward and do not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms, as the problem is a simple arithmetic one.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<840349>>>"
