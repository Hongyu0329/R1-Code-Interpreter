    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce. \n\n1. **Understanding the Volume Reduction**: \n   - When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the final volume of the sauce is half of the initial volume of the canned tomatoes.\n\n2. **Calculating Initial Volume**:\n   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is half the volume of the original canned tomatoes, the initial volume of the canned tomatoes must have been 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.\n\n3. **Determining Number of Cans Used**:\n   - Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total initial volume by the volume of one can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.\n\n4. **Calculating Number of Tomatoes**:\n   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.\n\nThus, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make her batch of tomato sauce.\n\n<<<12>>>"
