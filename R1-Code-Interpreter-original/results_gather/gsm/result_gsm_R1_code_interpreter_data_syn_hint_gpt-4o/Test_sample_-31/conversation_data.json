    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of shirts required for each size and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Extra-Small Shirts**: We know that 5,351,035 students need size extra-small shirts.\n\n2. **Small Shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is \\(2 \\times 5,351,035\\).\n\n3. **Medium Shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of medium shirts needed is \\((2 \\times 5,351,035) - 4\\).\n\n4. **Large Shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 5,351,035) - 4}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Extra-Large Shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of extra-large shirts needed is \\(\\frac{(2 \\times 5,351,035) - 4}{2} + 6\\).\n\nFinally, we sum up all these values to get the total number of shirts ordered.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of students needing extra-small shirts\nextra_small = 5351035\n\n# Number of students needing small shirts\nsmall = 2 * extra_small\n\n# Number of students needing medium shirts\nmedium = small - 4\n\n# Number of students needing large shirts\nlarge = medium // 2\n\n# Number of students needing extra-large shirts\nextra_large = large + 6\n\n# Total number of shirts ordered\ntotal_shirts = extra_small + small + medium + large + extra_large\n\nprint(total_shirts)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of shirts ordered.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the total number of shirts ordered is 37,457,243. This result is derived from the calculations based on the given conditions for each shirt size. \n\nLet's summarize the calculations:\n\n1. **Extra-Small Shirts**: 5,351,035 students.\n2. **Small Shirts**: \\(2 \\times 5,351,035 = 10,702,070\\) students.\n3. **Medium Shirts**: \\(10,702,070 - 4 = 10,702,066\\) students.\n4. **Large Shirts**: \\(\\frac{10,702,066}{2} = 5,351,033\\) students.\n5. **Extra-Large Shirts**: \\(5,351,033 + 6 = 5,351,039\\) students.\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of shirts ordered:\n\n\\[5,351,035 + 10,702,070 + 10,702,066 + 5,351,033 + 5,351,039 = 37,457,243\\]\n\nThis confirms the result from the code execution. Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:\n\n<<<37457243>>>"
