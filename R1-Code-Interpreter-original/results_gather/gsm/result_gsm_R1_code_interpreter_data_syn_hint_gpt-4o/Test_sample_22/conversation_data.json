    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of shirts needed for each size and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Extra-Small (XS):** We know that 5,351,035 students need size extra-small.\n\n2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Small} = 2 \\times \\text{Extra-Small} = 2 \\times 5,351,035\n   \\]\n\n3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of medium shirts needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Medium} = \\text{Small} - 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Large} = \\frac{\\text{Medium}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Extra-Large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of extra-large shirts needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Extra-Large} = \\text{Large} + 6\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we sum up all the shirts needed for each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of students needing each size\nextra_small = 5351035\nsmall = 2 * extra_small\nmedium = small - 4\nlarge = medium // 2\nextra_large = large + 6\n\n# Total number of shirts\ntotal_shirts = extra_small + small + medium + large + extra_large\n\nprint(total_shirts)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order is 37,457,243. This result is derived from the calculations based on the given conditions for each shirt size.\n\nLet's summarize the calculations:\n\n1. **Extra-Small (XS):** 5,351,035 students need size extra-small.\n\n2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, which is \\(2 \\times 5,351,035 = 10,702,070\\).\n\n3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, which is \\(10,702,070 - 4 = 10,702,066\\).\n\n4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium, which is \\(\\frac{10,702,066}{2} = 5,351,033\\).\n\n5. **Extra-Large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large, which is \\(5,351,033 + 6 = 5,351,039\\).\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of shirts:\n\\[\n5,351,035 + 10,702,070 + 10,702,066 + 5,351,033 + 5,351,039 = 37,457,243\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order is 37,457,243.\n\n<<<37457243>>>"
