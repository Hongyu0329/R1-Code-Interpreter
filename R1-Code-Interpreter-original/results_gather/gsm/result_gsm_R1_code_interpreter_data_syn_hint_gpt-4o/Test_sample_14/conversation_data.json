    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of each penny and then sum them up to find the combined weight.\n\n1. **Weight of the 1959 Penny**: We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 5244240 grains.\n\n2. **Weight of the 2010 Penny**: The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, the weight of the 2010 penny can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\text{Weight of 1959 penny}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combined Weight**: The combined weight of the two pennies is the sum of the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given weight of the 1959 penny\nweight_1959_penny = 5244240\n\n# Calculate weight of the 2010 penny\nweight_2010_penny = (3/4) * weight_1959_penny\n\n# Calculate combined weight\ncombined_weight = weight_1959_penny + weight_2010_penny\n\n# Output the combined weight\nprint(combined_weight)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the combined weight of the two pennies.",
    "The code execution result provides the combined weight of the two pennies as 9177420.0 grains. This result is consistent with the calculations based on the given problem statement.\n\nTo summarize the solution:\n\n- The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 5244240 grains.\n- The weight of the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the 1959 penny, which calculates to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 5244240 = 3933180 \\) grains.\n- The combined weight of the two pennies is the sum of their individual weights: \\( 5244240 + 3933180 = 9177420 \\) grains.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 9177420.0 grains.\n\n<<<9177420.0>>>"
