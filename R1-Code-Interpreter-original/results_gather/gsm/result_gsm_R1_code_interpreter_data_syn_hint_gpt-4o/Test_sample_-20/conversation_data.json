    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs each child receives when three dozen eggs are evenly distributed among four children.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - A dozen is equal to 12.\n   - Three dozen eggs mean \\(3 \\times 12\\) eggs.\n   - There are four children, and the eggs are to be distributed equally among them.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs:**\n   - Total eggs = \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\).\n\n3. **Distribute the Eggs Equally:**\n   - Each child receives \\( \\frac{36}{4} \\) eggs.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{4} = 9\n\\]\n\nEach child receives 9 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
