  "question": "Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on her skipping speed, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours given the time she spends on each activity.\n\n1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**\n   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.\n   - Her running speed is twice her skipping speed (since she skips at half the speed she runs).\n   - Therefore, her running speed is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) miles per hour.\n\n2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**\n   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.\n   - Therefore, her walking speed is \\(6 \\div 4 = 1.5\\) miles per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**\n   - Total time is 6 hours.\n   - One-third of the time is spent running: \\(6 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 2\\) hours.\n   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \\(6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 4\\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the distance traveled for each activity:**\n   - Distance running: \\(6 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 12\\) miles.\n   - Distance walking: \\(1.5 \\text{ mph} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 6\\) miles.\n\n5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**\n   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = \\(12 + 6 = 18\\) miles.\n\nThus, Dana can travel a total of 18 miles in six hours given the time she spends running and walking.\n\n<<<18>>>"
