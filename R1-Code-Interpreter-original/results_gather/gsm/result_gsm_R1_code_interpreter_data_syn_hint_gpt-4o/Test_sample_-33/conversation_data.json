    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter. We are given the number of red squares and the relationships between the numbers of squares of different colors.\n\n1. **Red Squares**: 3347396\n2. **Blue Squares**: 4 more than red squares\n3. **Green Squares**: 6 more than blue squares\n4. **White Squares**: 12 fewer than green squares\n\nLet's calculate the number of squares for each color:\n\n- **Blue Squares**: Red Squares + 4\n- **Green Squares**: Blue Squares + 6\n- **White Squares**: Green Squares - 12\n\nFinally, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of square feet in the comforter.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given number of red squares\nred_squares = 3347396\n\n# Calculate the number of squares for each color\nblue_squares = red_squares + 4\ngreen_squares = blue_squares + 6\nwhite_squares = green_squares - 12\n\n# Total number of squares\ntotal_squares = red_squares + blue_squares + green_squares + white_squares\n\n# Output the total number of square feet\nprint(total_squares)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of square feet.",
    "The code execution result provided the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter as 13,389,596. This result is obtained by summing up the number of squares of each color based on the given relationships.\n\nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. **Red Squares**: 3,347,396\n2. **Blue Squares**: 3,347,396 + 4 = 3,347,400\n3. **Green Squares**: 3,347,400 + 6 = 3,347,406\n4. **White Squares**: 3,347,406 - 12 = 3,347,394\n\nNow, summing these up:\n\n- Total Squares = 3,347,396 (Red) + 3,347,400 (Blue) + 3,347,406 (Green) + 3,347,394 (White)\n\nThe total number of square feet is indeed 13,389,596, as calculated.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13389596>>>"
