    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs each child receives when three dozen eggs are evenly distributed among four children.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs would be:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find out how many eggs each child receives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{36}{4} = 9 \\text{ eggs per child} \\]\n\nTherefore, each child receives 9 eggs.\n\n<<<9>>>"
