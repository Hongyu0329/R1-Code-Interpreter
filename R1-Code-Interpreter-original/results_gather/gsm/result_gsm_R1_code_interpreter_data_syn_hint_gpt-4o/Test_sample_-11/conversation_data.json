  "question": "Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%.\n\n1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**\n   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.\n   - Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.\n   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \\(38 + 2 = 40\\) seconds.\n\n2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**\n   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.\n   - A 10% improvement in speed means his time decreases by 10%.\n   - To find 10% of Gerald's original time: \\(0.10 \\times 40 = 4\\) seconds.\n   - Subtract this from Gerald's original time: \\(40 - 4 = 36\\) seconds.\n\nThus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.\n\n<<<36>>>"
