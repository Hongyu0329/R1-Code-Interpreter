    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students who went out through each exit and specifically find out how many went out through exit C.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:**\n   - 30% of the total students went out through exit A.\n   - Total students = 2,780,965\n   - Students through exit A = 30% of 2,780,965\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining students after exit A:**\n   - Remaining students = Total students - Students through exit A\n\n3. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:**\n   - 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:**\n   - The rest of the students went out through exit C.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Total number of students\ntotal_students = 2780965\n\n# Students through exit A\nstudents_exit_A = 0.30 * total_students\n\n# Remaining students after exit A\nremaining_students_after_A = total_students - students_exit_A\n\n# Students through exit B\nstudents_exit_B = (3/5) * remaining_students_after_A\n\n# Students through exit C\nstudents_exit_C = remaining_students_after_A - students_exit_B\n\n# Output the number of students who went out through exit C\nprint(int(students_exit_C))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the number of students who went out through exit C.",
    "The code execution result indicates that 778,670 students went out through exit C. Let's verify the steps to ensure the calculation is correct:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:**\n   - 30% of 2,780,965 = 0.30 * 2,780,965 = 834,289.5\n   - Since the number of students must be an integer, we consider 834,289 students went out through exit A.\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining students after exit A:**\n   - Remaining students = 2,780,965 - 834,289 = 1,946,676\n\n3. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:**\n   - 3/5 of the remaining students = (3/5) * 1,946,676 = 1,168,005.6\n   - Again, rounding to the nearest integer, 1,168,006 students went out through exit B.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:**\n   - Remaining students after exit B = 1,946,676 - 1,168,006 = 778,670\n\nThe calculation seems consistent with the code execution result. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is correct.\n\n<<<778670>>>"
