    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pink gumballs based on the given relationship with the blue gumballs.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( b \\) as the number of blue gumballs.\n- \\( p \\) as the number of pink gumballs.\n\nAccording to the problem, the relationship between the pink and blue gumballs is given by:\n\\[ p = 4b + 22 \\]\n\nWe are given that there are 9,913,180 blue gumballs. Therefore, we can substitute \\( b = 9,913,180 \\) into the equation to find \\( p \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of blue gumballs\nb = 9913180\n\n# Calculate the number of pink gumballs\np = 4 * b + 22\n\n# Output the result\nprint(p)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the number of pink gumballs.",
    "The code execution result provides the number of pink gumballs as 39,652,742. This result is consistent with the relationship given in the problem statement, where the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.\n\nGiven the calculation:\n\\[ p = 4 \\times 9,913,180 + 22 = 39,652,742 \\]\n\nThis confirms that the calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is:\n\n<<<39652742>>>"
