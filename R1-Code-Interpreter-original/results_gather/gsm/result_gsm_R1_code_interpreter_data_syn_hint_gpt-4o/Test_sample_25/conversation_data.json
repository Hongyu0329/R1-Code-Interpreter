    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges Jennifer has left after distributing them to her children.\n\n1. **Initial Count of Oranges**: Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.\n\n2. **Distribution to Daughters**: She has three daughters, and each daughter received 2 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given to her daughters is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ daughters} \\times 2 \\text{ oranges/daughter} = 6 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distribution to Son**: Her only son received 1,277,771 oranges.\n\n4. **Total Oranges Distributed**: The total number of oranges distributed to all her children is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ (to daughters)} + 1,277,771 \\text{ (to son)} = 1,277,777 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Remaining Oranges**: To find out how many oranges Jennifer has left, we subtract the total number of oranges distributed from the initial count:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ (initial oranges)} - 1,277,777 \\text{ (distributed oranges)} = -1,277,765 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\nThis calculation shows that Jennifer has a negative number of oranges, which indicates that the distribution exceeds the initial count. This is a logical inconsistency, but mathematically, the result is:\n\n```python\ninitial_oranges = 12\noranges_to_daughters = 3 * 2\noranges_to_son = 1277771\n\ntotal_distributed = oranges_to_daughters + oranges_to_son\nremaining_oranges = initial_oranges - total_distributed\n\nprint(remaining_oranges)\n```",
    "The code execution result confirms the calculation that Jennifer has a negative number of oranges, specifically -1,277,765. This indicates that the number of oranges given to her son is far greater than the initial number of oranges she had, which is logically inconsistent in a real-world scenario. However, mathematically, the calculation is correct based on the given numbers.\n\nSince the problem is straightforward and involves simple arithmetic, there is no need for complex symbolic computing or optimization. The task was to calculate the remaining number of oranges, and the code has done that correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1277765>>>"
