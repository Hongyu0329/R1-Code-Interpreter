    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.\n\n1. First, calculate Joey's weekly weight loss:\n   - Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.\n   - Therefore, Joey's weekly weight loss is \\( \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 2 \\text{ pounds per week} \\).\n\n2. Determine how much weight Sandy loses in one week:\n   - Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week.\n   - Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy loses \\( \\frac{2 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \\text{ pounds per week} \\).\n\n3. Calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:\n   - Sandy loses 0.5 pounds per week.\n   - To lose 8 pounds, Sandy will need \\( \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{0.5 \\text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \\text{ weeks} \\).\n\nThus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.\n\n<<<16>>>"
