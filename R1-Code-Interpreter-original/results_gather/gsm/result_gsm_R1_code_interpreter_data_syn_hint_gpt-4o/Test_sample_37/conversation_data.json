    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total age of all the siblings in the family. We have the following information:\n\n1. There are 2 brothers.\n2. There are 2,620,008 sisters, each 16 years old.\n3. One brother is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- Calculate the age of the older brother. Since the younger brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n- Calculate the total age of all the sisters. Since there are 2,620,008 sisters, each 16 years old, the total age of all sisters is 2,620,008 * 16.\n- Add the ages of the two brothers and the total age of all the sisters to get the total age of all siblings.\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters and their age\nnum_sisters = 2620008\nage_of_sisters = 16\n\n# Age of the brothers\nage_of_younger_brother = 12\nage_of_older_brother = age_of_younger_brother * 2\n\n# Total age of all sisters\ntotal_age_sisters = num_sisters * age_of_sisters\n\n# Total age of all siblings\ntotal_age_siblings = total_age_sisters + age_of_younger_brother + age_of_older_brother\n\nprint(total_age_siblings)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total age of all the siblings.",
    "The code execution result provides the total age of all siblings as 41,920,164. This result is derived from the following calculations:\n\n1. The younger brother is 12 years old.\n2. The older brother is 24 years old (since he is twice the age of the younger brother).\n3. There are 2,620,008 sisters, each 16 years old. Therefore, the total age of all sisters is 2,620,008 * 16 = 41,920,128.\n4. Adding the ages of the two brothers: 12 + 24 = 36.\n5. The total age of all siblings is 41,920,128 (sisters) + 36 (brothers) = 41,920,164.\n\nThe calculations are correct, and the code execution result matches the expected outcome. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<41920164>>>"
