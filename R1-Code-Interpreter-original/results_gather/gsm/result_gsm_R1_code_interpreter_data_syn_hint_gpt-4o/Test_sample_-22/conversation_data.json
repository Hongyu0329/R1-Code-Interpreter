  "question": "Mr Hezekiah had 1088322 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 1088322 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trucks successfully delivered their loads and then calculate the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers.\n\n1. **Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:**\n   - A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. Therefore, the number of trucks with mechanical failures is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1088322 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer:**\n   - The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer is the total number of trucks minus the number of trucks with mechanical failures.\n\n3. **Calculate the total tons of fertilizer delivered:**\n   - Each truck carries 1088322 tons of fertilizer. Therefore, the total amount of fertilizer delivered is the number of successful trucks multiplied by 1088322 tons.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Total number of trucks\ntotal_trucks = 1088322\n\n# Tons of fertilizer per truck\ntons_per_truck = 1088322\n\n# Calculate the number of trucks with mechanical failures\nfailed_trucks = total_trucks // 4\n\n# Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer\nsuccessful_trucks = total_trucks - failed_trucks\n\n# Calculate the total tons of fertilizer delivered\ntotal_fertilizer_delivered = successful_trucks * tons_per_truck\n\nprint(total_fertilizer_delivered)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers.",
    "The code execution result provides the total tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers, which is 888,334,125,924 tons. This result is obtained by calculating the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer and multiplying it by the tons of fertilizer each truck carried.\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n1. Calculate the number of trucks with mechanical failures: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1088322 = 272080.5 \\). Since the number of trucks must be an integer, we take the floor value, which is 272080.\n2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer: \\( 1088322 - 272080 = 816242 \\).\n3. Calculate the total tons of fertilizer delivered: \\( 816242 \\times 1088322 = 888334125924 \\).\n\nThe calculation is correct, and the code execution result matches the expected outcome. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<888334125924>>>"
