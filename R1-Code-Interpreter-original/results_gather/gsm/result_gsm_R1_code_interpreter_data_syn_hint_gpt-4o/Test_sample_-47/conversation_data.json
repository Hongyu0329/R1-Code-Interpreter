    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days.\n\n1. On Monday, Rose bought 6,665,653 cakes.\n2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, the number of cakes bought on Tuesday is \\(3 \\times 6,665,653\\).\n3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cakes bought on Wednesday is \\(5 \\times (3 \\times 6,665,653)\\).\n\nFinally, we sum up the number of cakes bought on each day to get the total number of cakes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of cakes bought on Monday\nmonday_cakes = 6665653\n\n# Number of cakes bought on Tuesday\ntuesday_cakes = 3 * monday_cakes\n\n# Number of cakes bought on Wednesday\nwednesday_cakes = 5 * tuesday_cakes\n\n# Total number of cakes bought\ntotal_cakes = monday_cakes + tuesday_cakes + wednesday_cakes\n\nprint(total_cakes)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of cakes.",
    "The code execution result shows that the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days is 126,647,407. This result is consistent with the calculations we performed:\n\n1. Monday: 6,665,653 cakes\n2. Tuesday: \\(3 \\times 6,665,653 = 19,996,959\\) cakes\n3. Wednesday: \\(5 \\times 19,996,959 = 99,984,795\\) cakes\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\n\\[6,665,653 + 19,996,959 + 99,984,795 = 126,647,407\\]\n\nThis confirms that the calculations are correct. Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 126,647,407.\n\n<<<126647407>>>"
