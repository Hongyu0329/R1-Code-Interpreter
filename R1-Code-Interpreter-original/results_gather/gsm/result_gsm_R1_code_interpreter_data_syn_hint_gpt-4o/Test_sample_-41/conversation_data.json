    "To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to first calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.\n\n1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, the total stripes for these two zebras are \\(2 \\times 17 = 34\\).\n\n2. There is one zebra with 3,009,606 stripes.\n\n3. Another zebra has half as many stripes as the zebra with 3,009,606 stripes. So, this zebra has \\(3,009,606 / 2\\) stripes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of stripes and the average:\n\n- Total number of zebras = 4\n- Total number of stripes = \\(34 + 3,009,606 + \\frac{3,009,606}{2}\\)\n\nFinally, we calculate the average by dividing the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of stripes for each zebra\nstripes_zebra_1_2 = 2 * 17\nstripes_zebra_3 = 3009606\nstripes_zebra_4 = 3009606 / 2\n\n# Total number of stripes\ntotal_stripes = stripes_zebra_1_2 + stripes_zebra_3 + stripes_zebra_4\n\n# Total number of zebras\ntotal_zebras = 4\n\n# Average number of stripes\naverage_stripes = total_stripes / total_zebras\n\nprint(average_stripes)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the average number of stripes.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average number of stripes on the zebras is 1,128,610.75. This result is consistent with the calculations we intended to perform:\n\n1. Two zebras with 17 stripes each contribute a total of 34 stripes.\n2. One zebra with 3,009,606 stripes.\n3. Another zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes, which is 1,504,803 stripes.\n\nThe total number of stripes is calculated as:\n\\[ 34 + 3,009,606 + 1,504,803 = 4,514,443 \\]\n\nThe average number of stripes is then:\n\\[ \\frac{4,514,443}{4} = 1,128,610.75 \\]\n\nThis confirms that the calculations were performed correctly. Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is:\n\n<<<1128610.75>>>"
