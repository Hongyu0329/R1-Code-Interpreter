    "To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to first calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.\n\n1. **Count the Zebras and Their Stripes:**\n   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \\(2 \\times 17 = 34\\) stripes.\n   - One zebra with 3,009,606 stripes.\n   - One zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes: \\(\\frac{3,009,606}{2} = 1,504,803\\) stripes.\n\n2. **Total Number of Zebras:**\n   - There are 4 zebras in total.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Stripes:**\n   - Total stripes = \\(34 + 3,009,606 + 1,504,803\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Number of Stripes:**\n   - Average stripes = \\(\\frac{\\text{Total stripes}}{\\text{Number of zebras}}\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of stripes for each zebra\nstripes_zebra1 = 17\nstripes_zebra2 = 17\nstripes_zebra3 = 3009606\nstripes_zebra4 = 3009606 / 2\n\n# Total number of stripes\ntotal_stripes = stripes_zebra1 + stripes_zebra2 + stripes_zebra3 + stripes_zebra4\n\n# Total number of zebras\ntotal_zebras = 4\n\n# Calculate average\naverage_stripes = total_stripes / total_zebras\n\nprint(average_stripes)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the average number of stripes on the zebras.",
    "The code execution result provides the average number of stripes on the zebras, which is 1,128,610.75. This result is consistent with the calculations we intended to perform:\n\n1. **Total Stripes Calculation:**\n   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each contribute \\(2 \\times 17 = 34\\) stripes.\n   - One zebra with 3,009,606 stripes.\n   - One zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes contributes \\(1,504,803\\) stripes.\n\n2. **Total Stripes:**\n   - Total stripes = \\(34 + 3,009,606 + 1,504,803 = 4,514,443\\).\n\n3. **Average Stripes Calculation:**\n   - Average stripes = \\(\\frac{4,514,443}{4} = 1,128,610.75\\).\n\nThe code correctly calculated the total number of stripes and divided by the number of zebras to find the average. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1128610.75>>>"
