    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of baby outfits Laurel has after receiving all the gifts.\n\n1. Laurel initially received 2,212,505 baby outfits from her friend.\n2. At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits. This means she received 2 * 2,212,505 = 4,425,010 new baby outfits.\n3. Laurel's mom gifted her with an additional 15 baby outfits.\n\nTo find the total number of baby outfits, we sum up all the outfits she received:\n\n- Outfits from her friend: 2,212,505\n- Outfits from the baby shower: 4,425,010\n- Outfits from her mom: 15\n\nNow, let's calculate the total:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outfits} = 2,212,505 + 4,425,010 + 15 \\]\n\nWe can calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Initial number of outfits from friend\noutfits_from_friend = 2212505\n\n# Outfits received at the baby shower (twice the amount from friend)\noutfits_from_shower = 2 * outfits_from_friend\n\n# Outfits received from mom\noutfits_from_mom = 15\n\n# Total outfits\ntotal_outfits = outfits_from_friend + outfits_from_shower + outfits_from_mom\n\nprint(total_outfits)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of baby outfits.",
    "The code execution result shows that the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is 6,637,530. This result is consistent with the calculations we performed in the reasoning process.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Laurel received 2,212,505 outfits from her friend.\n2. She received twice that amount at her baby shower, which is 4,425,010 outfits.\n3. Her mom gifted her an additional 15 outfits.\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 6,637,530 outfits.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6637530>>>"
