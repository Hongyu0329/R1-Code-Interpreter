    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, and this length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.\n\nFirst, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n- 8 feet = 8 * 12 inches = 96 inches\n- 4 inches = 4 inches\n\nTherefore, the total length of Topher's shoe in inches is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.\n\nAccording to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \\( x \\) inches. The equation based on the problem statement is:\n\n\\[ 9x + 10 = 100 \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for \\( x \\).\n\n\\[ 9x + 10 = 100 \\]\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 9x = 90 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
