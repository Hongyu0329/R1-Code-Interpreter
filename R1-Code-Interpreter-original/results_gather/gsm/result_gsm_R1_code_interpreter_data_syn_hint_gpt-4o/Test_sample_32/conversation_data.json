    "To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to consider the total number of women wearing heels and the total height of all the heels combined.\n\n1. **Identify the number of women and heel heights:**\n   - 3 women are wearing 4-inch heels.\n   - 8,449,158 women are wearing 2-inch heels.\n\n2. **Calculate the total height of all heels:**\n   - Total height from women wearing 4-inch heels = \\(3 \\times 4\\) inches.\n   - Total height from women wearing 2-inch heels = \\(8,449,158 \\times 2\\) inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of women:**\n   - Total number of women = \\(3 + 8,449,158\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the average height of heels:**\n   - Average height = \\(\\frac{\\text{Total height of all heels}}{\\text{Total number of women}}\\).\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of women wearing each type of heel\nwomen_4_inch = 3\nwomen_2_inch = 8449158\n\n# Total height of heels\ntotal_height_4_inch = women_4_inch * 4\ntotal_height_2_inch = women_2_inch * 2\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = women_4_inch + women_2_inch\n\n# Average height of heels\naverage_height = (total_height_4_inch + total_height_2_inch) / total_women\n\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the average height of heels at the party.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the average height of heels is approximately 2.0000007101296804 inches. This result is expected because the vast majority of women (8,449,158 out of 8,449,161) are wearing 2-inch heels, which heavily influences the average.\n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n- Total height from women wearing 4-inch heels: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) inches.\n- Total height from women wearing 2-inch heels: \\(8,449,158 \\times 2 = 16,898,316\\) inches.\n- Total number of women: \\(3 + 8,449,158 = 8,449,161\\).\n- Average height: \\(\\frac{12 + 16,898,316}{8,449,161} \\approx 2.0000007101296804\\).\n\nGiven the overwhelming number of women wearing 2-inch heels, the average height is very close to 2 inches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2.0000007101296804>>>"
