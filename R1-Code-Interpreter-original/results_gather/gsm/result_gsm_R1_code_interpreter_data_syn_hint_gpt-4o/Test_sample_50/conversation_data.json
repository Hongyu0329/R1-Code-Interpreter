    "To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:\n\n1. Let \\( c \\) be the number of chickens and \\( w \\) be the number of cows.\n2. We know that the total number of animals is 3,016,226, so:\n   \\[\n   c + w = 3,016,226\n   \\]\n3. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so:\n   \\[\n   2c + 4w = 70\n   \\]\n\nWe have two equations:\n1. \\( c + w = 3,016,226 \\)\n2. \\( 2c + 4w = 70 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of \\( c \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nFirst, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:\n\\[\nc + 2w = 35\n\\]\n\nNow we have:\n1. \\( c + w = 3,016,226 \\)\n2. \\( c + 2w = 35 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[\n(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 3,016,226\n\\]\n\\[\nw = 35 - 3,016,226\n\\]\n\nThis result is clearly incorrect because it gives a negative number of cows, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nGiven the total number of legs is 70, and the number of animals is 3,016,226, it seems there is a logical inconsistency because the number of legs is far too small for the number of animals. This suggests that the problem might be a trick question or contains an error in the given numbers.\n\nSince the total number of legs is only 70, and each animal has at least 2 legs, the maximum number of animals that could exist with 70 legs is 35 (if all were chickens). However, this is far less than 3,016,226 animals.\n\nThus, the only logical conclusion is that all 35 animals are chickens, and the rest of the animals (3,016,191) are not physically present or the problem is designed to highlight this inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the number of chickens is 35.\n\n<<<35>>>"
