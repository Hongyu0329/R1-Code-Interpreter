    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and then compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of the adults:**\n   - There are 9 adults in total (Jack + 8 others).\n   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.\n   - Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.\n\n2. **Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum load:**\n   - Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg.\n   - Total weight of the adults = 720 kg.\n   - Exceeded load = Total weight - Maximum load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.\n\nTherefore, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.\n\n<<<20>>>"
