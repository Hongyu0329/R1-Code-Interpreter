    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**\n   - Bo has 7,487,762 crabs.\n\n2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**\n   - Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.\n   - Therefore, Monic has \\( 7,487,762 - 4 \\) crabs.\n\n3. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**\n   - Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.\n   - Therefore, Rani has \\( (7,487,762 - 4) + 10 \\) crabs.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of crabs:**\n   - Total crabs = Crabs Bo has + Crabs Monic has + Crabs Rani has.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of crabs Bo has\nbo_crabs = 7487762\n\n# Number of crabs Monic has\nmonic_crabs = bo_crabs - 4\n\n# Number of crabs Rani has\nrani_crabs = monic_crabs + 10\n\n# Total number of crabs\ntotal_crabs = bo_crabs + monic_crabs + rani_crabs\n\nprint(total_crabs)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the total number of crabs the three have together.",
    "The code execution result shows that the total number of crabs the three have together is 22,463,288. This result is consistent with the calculations based on the given conditions:\n\n- Bo has 7,487,762 crabs.\n- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which is \\(7,487,762 - 4 = 7,487,758\\).\n- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, which is \\(7,487,758 + 10 = 7,487,768\\).\n\nThe total number of crabs is the sum of the crabs each person has:\n\\[ \n7,487,762 + 7,487,758 + 7,487,768 = 22,463,288 \n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<22463288>>>"
