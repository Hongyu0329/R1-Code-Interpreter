    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter. We are given the number of red squares and the relationships between the numbers of squares of different colors.\n\n1. **Red Squares**: There are 3,347,396 red squares.\n\n2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Blue Squares} = 3,347,396 + 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Green Squares} = (\\text{Blue Squares}) + 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{White Squares} = (\\text{Green Squares}) - 12\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of square feet in the comforter.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of red squares\nred_squares = 3347396\n\n# Calculate the number of blue squares\nblue_squares = red_squares + 4\n\n# Calculate the number of green squares\ngreen_squares = blue_squares + 6\n\n# Calculate the number of white squares\nwhite_squares = green_squares - 12\n\n# Total number of squares\ntotal_squares = red_squares + blue_squares + green_squares + white_squares\n\n# Output the total number of square feet\nprint(total_squares)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is 13,389,596. This result is derived from the sum of all the colored squares based on the given relationships.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the solution, let's break down the calculations:\n\n1. **Red Squares**: 3,347,396\n2. **Blue Squares**: 3,347,396 + 4 = 3,347,400\n3. **Green Squares**: 3,347,400 + 6 = 3,347,406\n4. **White Squares**: 3,347,406 - 12 = 3,347,394\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[\n3,347,396 + 3,347,400 + 3,347,406 + 3,347,394 = 13,389,596\n\\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that the total number of square feet in the comforter is indeed 13,389,596.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13389596>>>"
