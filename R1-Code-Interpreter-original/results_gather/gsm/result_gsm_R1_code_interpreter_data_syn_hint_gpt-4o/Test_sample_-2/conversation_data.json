    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cherry tomato vines Steve needs to grow to meet his and his girlfriend's consumption needs.\n\n1. **Determine Steve's weekly consumption:**\n   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.\n   - Therefore, in a week (7 days), he eats \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\) tomatoes.\n\n2. **Determine his girlfriend's weekly consumption:**\n   - Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.\n   - Therefore, his girlfriend eats \\( \\frac{42}{2} = 21\\) tomatoes per week.\n\n3. **Calculate the total weekly consumption:**\n   - Total tomatoes needed per week = Steve's weekly consumption + his girlfriend's weekly consumption = \\(42 + 21 = 63\\) tomatoes.\n\n4. **Determine the number of vines needed:**\n   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.\n   - To find the number of vines needed, divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week: \\( \\frac{63}{3} = 21\\) vines.\n\nThus, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly consumption needs.\n\n<<<21>>>"
