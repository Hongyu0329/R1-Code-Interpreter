    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of robots, helmets, and footballs in the changing room and then sum them up to find the total number of items.\n\n1. We are given that there are 20 helmets.\n2. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\).\n3. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs is \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of items by summing the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:\n\n- Robots: 10\n- Helmets: 20\n- Footballs: 40\n\nTotal number of items = Robots + Helmets + Footballs = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70\n\nThus, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70.\n\n<<<70>>>"
