    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment after returning the faulty ones.\n\n1. **Identify the total value of equipment purchased**: $4,326,221.\n\n2. **Determine the percentage of faulty equipment**: 40%.\n\n3. **Calculate the value of the faulty equipment**: \n   - Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, the value of the faulty equipment is 40% of the total purchase value.\n\n4. **Calculate the value of the functioning equipment**:\n   - Subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total purchase value to get the value of the functioning equipment.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Total value of equipment purchased\ntotal_value = 4326221\n\n# Percentage of faulty equipment\nfaulty_percentage = 40\n\n# Calculate the value of faulty equipment\nfaulty_value = (faulty_percentage / 100) * total_value\n\n# Calculate the value of functioning equipment\nfunctioning_value = total_value - faulty_value\n\n# Output the value of functioning equipment\nprint(functioning_value)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment.",
    "The code execution result shows that the value of the functioning equipment is approximately $2,595,732.60. This result is derived from subtracting the value of the faulty equipment from the total purchase value.\n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1. **Total value of equipment purchased**: $4,326,221.\n2. **Faulty equipment percentage**: 40%.\n3. **Value of faulty equipment**: \n   - \\( \\text{Faulty Value} = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 4,326,221 = 1,730,488.40 \\).\n\n4. **Value of functioning equipment**:\n   - \\( \\text{Functioning Value} = 4,326,221 - 1,730,488.40 = 2,595,732.60 \\).\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and correct. The code executed correctly, and the result is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:\n\n<<<2595732.60>>>"
