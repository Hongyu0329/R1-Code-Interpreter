# Given weight of the 1959 penny
weight_1959_penny = 5244240

# Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny
weight_2010_penny = (3/4) * weight_1959_penny

# Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies
combined_weight = weight_1959_penny + weight_2010_penny

# Output the combined weight
print(combined_weight)
