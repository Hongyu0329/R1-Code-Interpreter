  "question": "Belen has two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 5244240 grains, what is the combined weight of the two pennies?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weight of the 2010 penny and then add it to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight.\n\n1. We know the weight of the 1959 penny is 5244240 grains.\n2. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, the weight of the 2010 penny can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\text{Weight of 1959 penny}\n   \\]\n3. Finally, the combined weight of the two pennies is the sum of the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given weight of the 1959 penny\nweight_1959_penny = 5244240\n\n# Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny\nweight_2010_penny = (3/4) * weight_1959_penny\n\n# Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies\ncombined_weight = weight_1959_penny + weight_2010_penny\n\n# Output the combined weight\nprint(combined_weight)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the combined weight.",
    "The code execution result provided the combined weight of the two pennies as 9177420.0 grains. This result is consistent with the calculations based on the given problem statement.\n\nTo summarize the solution:\n- The weight of the 1959 penny is 5244240 grains.\n- The weight of the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the 1959 penny, which is calculated as \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 5244240 = 3933180 \\) grains.\n- The combined weight of the two pennies is the sum of their weights: \\( 5244240 + 3933180 = 9177420 \\) grains.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 9177420 grains.\n\n<<<9177420>>>"
