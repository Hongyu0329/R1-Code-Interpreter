    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total population of the school and then calculate the number of girls.\n\n1. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and the number of boys is 560,233.\n2. Let's denote the total population of the school as \\( P \\).\n3. According to the problem, 40% of \\( P \\) is equal to 560,233. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.4 \\times P = 560233\n   \\]\n4. Solving for \\( P \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{560233}{0.4}\n   \\]\n5. Once we have the total population \\( P \\), we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = P - 560233\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given data\nboys = 560233\npercentage_boys = 0.4\n\n# Calculate total population\ntotal_population = boys / percentage_boys\n\n# Calculate number of girls\ngirls = total_population - boys\n\n# Output the number of girls\nprint(int(girls))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the number of girls in the school.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the number of girls in the school is 840,349. This result is consistent with the calculations we performed:\n\n1. We calculated the total population of the school using the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{560233}{0.4} = 1,400,582.5\n   \\]\n   Since the population must be a whole number, we consider it as 1,400,583.\n\n2. We then calculated the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = 1,400,583 - 560,233 = 840,350\n   \\]\n\nHowever, the code output was 840,349, which is slightly off due to rounding during the calculation of the total population. The correct number of girls should be 840,350.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<840350>>>"
