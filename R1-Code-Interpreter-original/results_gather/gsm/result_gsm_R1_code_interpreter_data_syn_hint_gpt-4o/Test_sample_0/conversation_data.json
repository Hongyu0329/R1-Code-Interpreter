    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bolts required to make the robe. We are given that the robe requires 2,287,720 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of bolts of white fiber needed:\n- White fiber bolts = 2,287,720 / 2\n\nNext, we add the number of blue fiber bolts and white fiber bolts to get the total number of bolts required.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\nblue_fiber_bolts = 2287720\nwhite_fiber_bolts = blue_fiber_bolts / 2\ntotal_bolts = blue_fiber_bolts + white_fiber_bolts\nprint(total_bolts)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of bolts.",
    "The code execution result shows that the total number of bolts required is 3,431,580.0. This result is obtained by adding the number of blue fiber bolts (2,287,720) and the number of white fiber bolts (1,143,860), which is half of the blue fiber bolts.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and does not require complex symbolic computing or optimization. The code correctly computes the total number of bolts needed for the robe.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3431580.0>>>"
