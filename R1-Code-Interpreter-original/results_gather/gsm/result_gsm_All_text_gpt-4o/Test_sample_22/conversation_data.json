    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of shirts needed for each size and then sum them up to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Extra-Small Shirts:**\n   - The number of students needing size extra-small is given as 5,351,035.\n\n2. **Small Shirts:**\n   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.\n   - Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is 2 times the number of extra-small shirts.\n   - Calculation: \\( 2 \\times 5,351,035 = 10,702,070 \\).\n\n3. **Medium Shirts:**\n   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.\n   - Therefore, the number of medium shirts needed is the number of small shirts minus 4.\n   - Calculation: \\( 10,702,070 - 4 = 10,702,066 \\).\n\n4. **Large Shirts:**\n   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.\n   - Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is half the number of medium shirts.\n   - Calculation: \\( \\frac{10,702,066}{2} = 5,351,033 \\).\n\n5. **Extra-Large Shirts:**\n   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.\n   - Therefore, the number of extra-large shirts needed is the number of large shirts plus 6.\n   - Calculation: \\( 5,351,033 + 6 = 5,351,039 \\).\n\n6. **Total Shirts:**\n   - To find the total number of shirts, sum up all the shirts needed for each size.\n   - Calculation: \\( 5,351,035 + 10,702,070 + 10,702,066 + 5,351,033 + 5,351,039 = 37,457,243 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order is:\n\n<<<37457243>>>"
