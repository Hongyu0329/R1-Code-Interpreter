    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference between the two amounts.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost for the baseball coach:**\n   - The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs.\n   - Each baseball costs $9414724.\n   - Total cost for baseballs = Number of baseballs × Cost per baseball\n   - Total cost for baseballs = 9 × $9414724\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost for the basketball coach:**\n   - The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs.\n   - Each basketball costs $14.\n   - Total cost for basketballs = Number of basketballs × Cost per basketball\n   - Total cost for basketballs = 8 × $14\n\n3. **Calculate the difference in spending:**\n   - We need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach.\n   - Difference = Total cost for basketballs - Total cost for baseballs\n\n4. **Perform the calculations:**\n   - Total cost for baseballs = 9 × $9414724 = $84732516\n   - Total cost for basketballs = 8 × $14 = $112\n   - Difference = $112 - $84732516\n\n5. **Determine the final answer:**\n   - Since the total cost for baseballs is much higher than the total cost for basketballs, the difference will be negative, indicating that the basketball coach spent less than the baseball coach.\n\n6. **Final calculation:**\n   - Difference = $112 - $84732516 = -$84732404\n\nTherefore, the basketball coach spent $84732404 less than the baseball coach.\n\nFinal answer: <<<-84732404>>>"
