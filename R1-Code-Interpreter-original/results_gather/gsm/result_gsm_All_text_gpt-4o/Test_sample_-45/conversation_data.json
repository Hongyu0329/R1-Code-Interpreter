    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these two amounts together to find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of tomato seeds:**\n   - Number of packets of tomato seeds = 20\n   - Cost per packet of tomato seeds = $2802500\n   - Total cost for tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet\n   - Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 × $2802500\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of celery seeds:**\n   - Number of packets of celery seeds = 80\n   - Cost per packet of celery seeds = $30\n   - Total cost for celery seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet\n   - Total cost for celery seeds = 80 × $30\n\n3. **Add the total costs of tomato and celery seeds to find the total expenditure:**\n   - Total expenditure = Total cost for tomato seeds + Total cost for celery seeds\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 × $2802500 = $56050000\n- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 × $30 = $2400\n- Total expenditure = $56050000 + $2400 = $56052400\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:\n\n<<<56052400>>>"
