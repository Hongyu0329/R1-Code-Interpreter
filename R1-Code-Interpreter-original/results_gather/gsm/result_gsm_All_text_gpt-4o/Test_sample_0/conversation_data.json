    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts required to make the robe, given the quantities of blue and white fiber bolts needed.\n\n1. **Identify the number of blue fiber bolts:**\n   - The problem states that the robe requires 2,287,720 bolts of blue fiber.\n\n2. **Determine the number of white fiber bolts:**\n   - The problem states that the robe requires half as many white fiber bolts as blue fiber bolts.\n   - Calculate the number of white fiber bolts: \n     \\[\n     \\text{White fiber bolts} = \\frac{2,287,720}{2} = 1,143,860\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of bolts:**\n   - Add the number of blue fiber bolts and white fiber bolts to find the total:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total bolts} = 2,287,720 + 1,143,860 = 3,431,580\n     \\]\n\n4. **Output the final answer:**\n   - The total number of bolts required is 3,431,580.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3431580>>>"
