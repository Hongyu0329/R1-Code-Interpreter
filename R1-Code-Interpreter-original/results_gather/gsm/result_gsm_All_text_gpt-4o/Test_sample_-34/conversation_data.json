    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost James incurs in the first year for buying and maintaining the plane. We will break down the costs into their components and sum them up.\n\n1. **Cost of the Plane:**\n   - The initial cost of purchasing the plane is $150,000.\n\n2. **Monthly Hanger Rent:**\n   - James pays $8,578,246 per month to rent a hanger.\n   - For one year (12 months), the total hanger rent is:\n     \\[\n     8,578,246 \\times 12 = 102,938,952\n     \\]\n\n3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**\n   - James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on hanger rent.\n   - Monthly fuel cost is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 8,578,246 = 17,156,492\n     \\]\n   - For one year (12 months), the total fuel cost is:\n     \\[\n     17,156,492 \\times 12 = 205,877,904\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost for the First Year:**\n   - Add the cost of the plane, total hanger rent for the year, and total fuel cost for the year:\n     \\[\n     150,000 + 102,938,952 + 205,877,904 = 308,966,856\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:\n\n<<<308966856>>>"
