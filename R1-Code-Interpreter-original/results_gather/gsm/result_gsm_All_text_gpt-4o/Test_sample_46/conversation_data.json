  "question": "Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Jar:**\n   - The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.\n   - Volume of the jar = base area × height = 6 inches × 6 inches × 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the Effective Volume for Jelly Beans:**\n   - The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is effectively used for jelly beans.\n   - Effective volume = 540 cubic inches × 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Jelly Beans:**\n   - Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.\n   - Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume per jelly bean = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.\n\n4. **Estimate the Number of Red Jelly Beans:**\n   - Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.\n   - Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans × 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference from the True Number:**\n   - The true number of red jelly beans is 900.\n   - Difference = True number - Estimated number = 900 - 864 = 36.\n\nTherefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 jelly beans.\n\nFinal answer: <<<36>>>"
