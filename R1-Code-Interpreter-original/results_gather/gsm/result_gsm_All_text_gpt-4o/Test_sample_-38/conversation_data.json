    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink based on the number of kilometers she runs. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the total distance Hannah runs in kilometers:**\n   - Hannah runs 7637264 laps.\n   - Each lap is 0.25 km.\n   - To find the total distance in kilometers, multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total distance in km} = 7637264 \\times 0.25\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total distance:**\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     7637264 \\times 0.25 = 1909316 \\text{ km}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink:**\n   - Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.\n   - To find the total amount of water in milliliters, multiply the total distance in kilometers by the amount of water per kilometer:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total water in ml} = 1909316 \\times 60\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of water:**\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     1909316 \\times 60 = 114558960 \\text{ ml}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 114558960 milliliters.\n\nFinal answer: <<<114558960>>>"
