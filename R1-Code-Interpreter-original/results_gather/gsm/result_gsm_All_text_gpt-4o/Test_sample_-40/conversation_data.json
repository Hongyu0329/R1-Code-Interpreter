    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trays of eggnog Rozanne can put out based on the number of eggs she has and the requirements for each glass of eggnog.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:**\n   - Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) eggs.\n   - She also has 2 additional loose eggs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of eggs is \\(48 + 2 = 50\\) eggs.\n\n2. **Determine how many eggs are needed for each glass of eggnog:**\n   - Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of glasses Rozanne can make:**\n   - With 50 eggs and each glass requiring 5 eggs, the number of glasses Rozanne can make is \\( \\frac{50}{5} = 10\\) glasses.\n\n4. **Determine how many trays Rozanne can put out:**\n   - Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.\n   - With 10 glasses available, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is \\( \\frac{10}{5} = 2\\) trays.\n\nTherefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
