    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total age of all the siblings in the family, which includes 2 brothers and 2,620,008 sisters. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the ages of the brothers:**\n   - One brother is 12 years old.\n   - The problem states that this brother's age is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n\n2. **Identify the age of the sisters:**\n   - All 2,620,008 sisters are the same age, which is 16 years old.\n\n3. **Calculate the total age of the brothers:**\n   - The total age of the two brothers is 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 36 years.\n\n4. **Calculate the total age of the sisters:**\n   - Since all sisters are 16 years old, the total age of all the sisters is 2,620,008 * 16.\n\n5. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**\n   - Add the total age of the brothers to the total age of the sisters:\n     - Total age of sisters = 2,620,008 * 16 = 41,920,128 years.\n     - Total age of all siblings = 36 (total age of brothers) + 41,920,128 (total age of sisters) = 41,920,164 years.\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings in the family is:\n\n<<<41920164>>>"
