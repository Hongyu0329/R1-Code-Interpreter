    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trays of eggnog Rozanne can put out based on the number of eggs she has and the requirements for each glass of eggnog.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:**\n   - Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) eggs.\n   - She also has 2 additional loose eggs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of eggs is \\(48 + 2 = 50\\) eggs.\n\n2. **Determine the number of glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make:**\n   - Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs.\n   - To find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of glasses} = \\frac{50 \\text{ eggs}}{5 \\text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \\text{ glasses}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of trays Rozanne can put out:**\n   - Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.\n   - To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, divide the number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of trays} = \\frac{10 \\text{ glasses}}{5 \\text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \\text{ trays}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>."
