    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze each step and perform the necessary calculations:\n\n1. **Initial Outfits from Friend:**\n   - Laurel's friend gave her 2,212,505 baby outfits.\n\n2. **Outfits Received at Baby Shower:**\n   - At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits as she initially received from her friend.\n   - Calculation: 2 * 2,212,505 = 4,425,010 outfits.\n\n3. **Outfits Gifted by Mom:**\n   - Laurel's mom gifted her with an additional 15 baby outfits.\n\n4. **Total Outfits Calculation:**\n   - To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add all the outfits together:\n   - Total outfits = Outfits from friend + Outfits from baby shower + Outfits from mom\n   - Total outfits = 2,212,505 + 4,425,010 + 15\n\n5. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - 2,212,505 + 4,425,010 = 6,637,515\n   - 6,637,515 + 15 = 6,637,530\n\nTherefore, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is 6,637,530.\n\nFinal answer: <<<6637530>>>"
