    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference between the two amounts.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost for the baseball coach:**\n   - The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs.\n   - Each baseball costs $9414724.\n   - Total cost for the baseball coach = 9 baseballs * $9414724 per baseball.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost for the basketball coach:**\n   - The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs.\n   - Each basketball costs $14.\n   - Total cost for the basketball coach = 8 basketballs * $14 per basketball.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference in spending:**\n   - We need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach.\n   - Difference = Total cost for the basketball coach - Total cost for the baseball coach.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- Total cost for the baseball coach = 9 * $9414724 = $84732516.\n- Total cost for the basketball coach = 8 * $14 = $112.\n\nNow, calculate the difference:\n\n- Difference = $112 - $84732516 = -$84732404.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the basketball coach spent less than the baseball coach.\n\nTherefore, the basketball coach spent $84732404 less than the baseball coach.\n\nFinal answer: <<<-84732404>>>."
