    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, apply the discount, and then determine the final amount he has to spend. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the cost of each item:**\n   - Notebook: $1.50 each\n   - Pen: $0.25 each\n   - Calculator: $12 each\n   - Geometry set: $10 each\n\n2. **Determine the quantity of each item Daniel wants to buy:**\n   - Notebooks: 5\n   - Pens: 2\n   - Calculators: 7308681\n   - Geometry sets: 7308681\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for each type of item:**\n   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 notebooks × $1.50/notebook = $7.50\n   - Total cost for pens = 2 pens × $0.25/pen = $0.50\n   - Total cost for calculators = 7308681 calculators × $12/calculator = $87,704,172\n   - Total cost for geometry sets = 7308681 geometry sets × $10/geometry set = $73,086,810\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**\n   - Total cost before discount = $7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (pens) + $87,704,172 (calculators) + $73,086,810 (geometry sets)\n   - Total cost before discount = $160,791,990\n\n5. **Apply the 10% discount:**\n   - Discount amount = 10% of $160,791,990 = 0.10 × $160,791,990 = $16,079,199\n   - Total cost after discount = $160,791,990 - $16,079,199 = $144,712,791\n\n6. **Final amount Daniel has to spend:**\n   - The final amount Daniel has to spend is $144,712,791.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<144712791>>>"
