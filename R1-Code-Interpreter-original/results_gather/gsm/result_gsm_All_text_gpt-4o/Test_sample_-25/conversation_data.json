  "question": "Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag.  The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If Jason had picked up and carried 6752769 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of basketballs based on the information given about how many each boy carried.\n\n1. **Understand the relationships:**\n   - Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.\n   - Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.\n\n2. **Define variables:**\n   - Let \\( J \\) be the number of balls Jason carried.\n   - Let \\( Jf \\) be the number of balls Jeffrey carried.\n   - Let \\( Jn \\) be the number of balls Jordan carried.\n\n3. **Set up equations based on relationships:**\n   - We know from the problem that Jason carried 6752769 balls, so \\( J = 6752769 \\).\n   - Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, we have \\( J = 2 \\times Jf \\). Therefore, \\( Jf = \\frac{J}{2} = \\frac{6752769}{2} \\).\n   - Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, we have \\( Jn = 2 \\times J = 2 \\times 6752769 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the number of balls each boy carried:**\n   - Jeffrey carried \\( Jf = \\frac{6752769}{2} = 3376384.5 \\). Since the number of balls must be a whole number, this indicates a mistake in the problem setup or an assumption. However, for the sake of calculation, we will proceed with the fractional value.\n   - Jordan carried \\( Jn = 2 \\times 6752769 = 13505538 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of balls:**\n   - Total number of balls = \\( Jf + J + Jn \\).\n   - Total number of balls = \\( 3376384.5 + 6752769 + 13505538 \\).\n\n6. **Sum up the values:**\n   - Total number of balls = \\( 3376384.5 + 6752769 + 13505538 = 23634691.5 \\).\n\nGiven the fractional result, it suggests an error in the problem setup or assumptions, as the number of balls should be a whole number. However, based on the calculations:\n\nThe total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is <<<23634691.5>>>."
