    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Freda used to make her last batch of tomato sauce, which resulted in 32 ounces of sauce. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Volume Reduction**: \n   - When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the final volume of the sauce is half of the original volume of the canned tomatoes.\n\n2. **Final Volume of Sauce**:\n   - The final volume of the sauce is given as 32 ounces.\n\n3. **Original Volume of Canned Tomatoes**:\n   - Since the sauce loses half its volume during cooking, the original volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice the final volume of the sauce.\n   - Therefore, the original volume of the canned tomatoes is \\(32 \\text{ ounces} \\times 2 = 64 \\text{ ounces}\\).\n\n4. **Volume per Can of Tomatoes**:\n   - Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces.\n\n5. **Number of Cans Used**:\n   - To find out how many cans were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total original volume by the volume per can.\n   - Number of cans = \\( \\frac{64 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \\text{ cans}\\).\n\n6. **Tomatoes per Can**:\n   - Each can contains three tomatoes.\n\n7. **Total Number of Tomatoes Used**:\n   - Since each can contains three tomatoes, and Freda used 4 cans, the total number of tomatoes used is:\n   - Total tomatoes = \\(4 \\text{ cans} \\times 3 \\text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \\text{ tomatoes}\\).\n\nTherefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce.\n\nFinal answer: <<<12>>>"
