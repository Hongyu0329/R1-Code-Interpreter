    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of colored squares on Brittany's quilted comforter. We are given the number of red squares and the relationships between the numbers of squares of different colors. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Red Squares:**\n   - The number of red squares is given as 3,347,396.\n\n2. **Blue Squares:**\n   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.\n   - Therefore, the number of blue squares is \\(3,347,396 + 4 = 3,347,400\\).\n\n3. **Green Squares:**\n   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.\n   - Therefore, the number of green squares is \\(3,347,400 + 6 = 3,347,406\\).\n\n4. **White Squares:**\n   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.\n   - Therefore, the number of white squares is \\(3,347,406 - 12 = 3,347,394\\).\n\n5. **Total Number of Squares:**\n   - To find the total number of squares, we add up all the squares of different colors:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total squares} = \\text{Red squares} + \\text{Blue squares} + \\text{Green squares} + \\text{White squares}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 3,347,396 + 3,347,400 + 3,347,406 + 3,347,394\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Total:**\n   - Let's calculate the total:\n   \\[\n   3,347,396 + 3,347,400 + 3,347,406 + 3,347,394 = 13,389,596\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is 13,389,596.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<13389596>>>."
