    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Farmer Brown's animals are chickens. We know the following:\n\n1. The total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 3,016,226.\n2. The total number of legs is 70.\n\nWe also know:\n- Chickens have 2 legs each.\n- Cows have 4 legs each.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( C \\) as the number of chickens.\n- \\( W \\) as the number of cows.\n\nFrom the information given, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1. \\( C + W = 3,016,226 \\) (total number of animals)\n2. \\( 2C + 4W = 70 \\) (total number of legs)\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the second equation.**\n\nDivide the entire second equation by 2 to simplify it:\n\\[ C + 2W = 35 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve the system of equations.**\n\nWe have:\n1. \\( C + W = 3,016,226 \\)\n2. \\( C + 2W = 35 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\\[ (C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 3,016,226 \\]\n\\[ C + 2W - C - W = 35 - 3,016,226 \\]\n\\[ W = 35 - 3,016,226 \\]\n\nThis results in:\n\\[ W = -3,016,191 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of chickens.**\n\nSubstitute \\( W = -3,016,191 \\) back into the first equation:\n\\[ C + (-3,016,191) = 3,016,226 \\]\n\\[ C = 3,016,226 + 3,016,191 \\]\n\\[ C = 6,032,417 \\]\n\nHowever, this result is not possible because the number of chickens cannot exceed the total number of animals. Let's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nGiven the total number of legs is 70, and the total number of animals is 3,016,226, it seems there is a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement, as the number of legs is far too small for the number of animals. \n\nTherefore, based on the given conditions, the problem is not feasible with the provided numbers. The number of chickens cannot be determined accurately with the given data.\n\nThe final answer, considering the logical inconsistency, is:\n<<<0>>>"
