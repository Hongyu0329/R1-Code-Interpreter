    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing based on the information given.\n\n1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**\n   - Boating: John spends 6 hours boating.\n   - Swimming: He spends half the time he spent boating, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours.\n   - Watching shows: He watches 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours watching shows.\n\n2. **Determine the total time spent on vacation:**\n   - The time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let \\( T \\) be the total time spent on vacation.\n   - Therefore, \\( 0.3T = 6 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( T \\), we get \\( T = \\frac{6}{0.3} = 20 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing accounts for 40% of the total time.\n   - Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is \\( 0.4 \\times 20 = 8 \\) hours.\n\nThus, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.\n\nFinal answer: <<<8>>>"
