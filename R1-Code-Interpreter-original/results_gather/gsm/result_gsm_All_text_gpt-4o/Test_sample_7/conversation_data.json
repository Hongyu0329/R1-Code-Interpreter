    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students exited through each of the three exits and specifically find out how many exited through exit C.\n\n1. **Total Number of Students**:  \n   The total number of students in the hall is 2,780,965.\n\n2. **Students Exiting Through Exit A**:  \n   - 30% of the students exited through exit A.\n   - Calculate 30% of 2,780,965:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Students through A} = 0.30 \\times 2,780,965 = 834,289.5\n     \\]\n   - Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 834,289.5 to 834,289.\n\n3. **Remaining Students After Exit A**:  \n   - Subtract the number of students who exited through A from the total number of students:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining students} = 2,780,965 - 834,289 = 1,946,676\n     \\]\n\n4. **Students Exiting Through Exit B**:  \n   - 3/5 of the remaining students exited through exit B.\n   - Calculate 3/5 of 1,946,676:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Students through B} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 1,946,676 = 1,168,005.6\n     \\]\n   - Again, rounding to the nearest whole number, we have 1,168,006 students.\n\n5. **Students Exiting Through Exit C**:  \n   - The rest of the students exited through exit C.\n   - Subtract the number of students who exited through B from the remaining students:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Students through C} = 1,946,676 - 1,168,006 = 778,670\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of students who went out through exit C is 778,670.\n\nFinal answer: <<<778670>>>"
