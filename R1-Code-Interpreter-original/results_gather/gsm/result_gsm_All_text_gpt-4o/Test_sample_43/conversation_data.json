  "question": "Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 360935 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of popcorn kernels that pop during each 30-second interval and then sum them up to find the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has.\n\n1. **First 30 seconds:**\n   - Number of kernels that pop: 360,935\n\n2. **Second 30 seconds:**\n   - The popping rate triples compared to the first 30 seconds.\n   - Number of kernels that pop: 3 * 360,935 = 1,082,805\n\n3. **Third 30 seconds:**\n   - The popping rate increases to four times the initial rate.\n   - Number of kernels that pop: 4 * 360,935 = 1,443,740\n\n4. **Fourth 30 seconds:**\n   - The popping rate slows down to half the rate of the third 30 seconds.\n   - Number of kernels that pop: (1/2) * 1,443,740 = 721,870\n\n5. **Residual popping after removing from heat:**\n   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat.\n   - Number of kernels that pop: (1/4) * 721,870 = 180,467.5\n\n6. **Total number of pieces of popcorn:**\n   - Sum up all the kernels that popped during each interval:\n   - Total = 360,935 + 1,082,805 + 1,443,740 + 721,870 + 180,467.5\n\nNow, let's calculate the total:\n\nTotal = 360,935 + 1,082,805 + 1,443,740 + 721,870 + 180,467.5 = 3,789,817.5\n\nSince the number of pieces of popcorn must be a whole number, we round 3,789,817.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 3,789,818.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:\n\n<<<3789818>>>"
