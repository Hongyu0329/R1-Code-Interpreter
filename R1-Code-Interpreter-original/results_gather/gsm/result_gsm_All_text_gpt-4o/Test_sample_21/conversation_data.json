    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches, given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.\n\n1. **Understand the Units:**\n   - Topher's shoe length is given in feet and inches. We need to convert this to inches for consistency.\n   - 1 foot = 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches.\n   - Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.\n\n2. **Set Up the Relationship:**\n   - According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.\n   - The relationship can be expressed as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Length of Topher's shoe} = 9 \\times \\text{Length of Bobby's shoe} + 10\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known length of Topher's shoe:\n     \\[\n     100 = 9x + 10\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     100 - 10 = 9x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     90 = 9x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{90}{9} = 10\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
