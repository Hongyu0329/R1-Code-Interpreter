    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice and then calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten by both.\n\n1. **Calculate Beatrice's Total Roll-Ups:**\n   - Beatrice's roll-ups are described as being 549047 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.\n   - To find the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate, multiply the width by the length:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Beatrice's total roll-ups} = 549047 \\times 24\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Marcell's Total Roll-Ups:**\n   - Marcell's roll-ups are described as being 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.\n   - To find the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate, multiply the width by the length:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Marcell's total roll-ups} = 3 \\times 14\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Roll-Ups Eaten by Both:**\n   - Add the total roll-ups eaten by Beatrice and Marcell:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total roll-ups eaten} = \\text{Beatrice's total roll-ups} + \\text{Marcell's total roll-ups}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Roll-Ups Eaten:**\n   - Since there are two people, divide the total roll-ups eaten by 2 to find the average:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average roll-ups eaten} = \\frac{\\text{Total roll-ups eaten}}{2}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n- Beatrice's total roll-ups: \\( 549047 \\times 24 = 13177128 \\)\n- Marcell's total roll-ups: \\( 3 \\times 14 = 42 \\)\n- Total roll-ups eaten: \\( 13177128 + 42 = 13177170 \\)\n- Average roll-ups eaten: \\( \\frac{13177170}{2} = 6588585 \\)\n\nTherefore, the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:\n\n<<<6588585>>>"
