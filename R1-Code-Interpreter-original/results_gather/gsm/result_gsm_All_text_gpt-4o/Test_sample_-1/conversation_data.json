    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon and then determine the time James took for each segment, ultimately finding out how long it took James to do the run.\n\n1. **Calculate Jon's Total Time:**\n   - Swim: 40 minutes\n   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes\n   - Run: 50 minutes\n   - Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes\n\n2. **Determine James's Time for Each Segment:**\n   - **Swim:** James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon.\n     - Jon's swim time = 40 minutes\n     - 10% of 40 minutes = 0.10 * 40 = 4 minutes\n     - James's swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes\n\n   - **Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon.\n     - Jon's bike time = 80 minutes\n     - James's bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes\n\n   - **Run:** We need to find out James's run time.\n\n3. **Calculate James's Total Time:**\n   - Jon won by 10 minutes, meaning James took 10 minutes longer than Jon.\n   - Jon's total time = 170 minutes\n   - James's total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes\n\n4. **Calculate James's Run Time:**\n   - James's total time = James's swim time + James's bike time + James's run time\n   - 180 = 36 (swim) + 85 (bike) + James's run time\n   - James's run time = 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes\n\nTherefore, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.\n\nFinal answer: <<<59>>>"
