    "To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the information given about her skipping speed, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time she spends running and walking.\n\n1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed:**\n   - Dana skips at 3 miles per hour.\n\n2. **Determine Dana's running speed:**\n   - Dana's skipping speed is half of her running speed.\n   - Therefore, her running speed is 2 times her skipping speed.\n   - Running speed = 2 * 3 mph = 6 mph.\n\n3. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**\n   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.\n   - Therefore, her walking speed is 1/4 of her running speed.\n   - Walking speed = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.\n\n4. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**\n   - Total time = 6 hours.\n   - Time spent running = 1/3 of total time = 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours.\n   - Time spent walking = 2/3 of total time = 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours.\n\n5. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**\n   - Distance = Speed * Time.\n   - Distance running = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles.\n\n6. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**\n   - Distance walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles.\n\n7. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**\n   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking.\n   - Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.\n\nFinal answer: <<<18>>>"
