    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Mark incurs for getting a new radiator and having it installed. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Cost of the Radiator:**\n   - The original cost of the radiator is $1,199,484.\n\n2. **Discount on the Radiator:**\n   - Mark gets the radiator at a junk shop with an 80% discount.\n   - To find the discount amount, calculate 80% of the original cost:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Discount} = 0.80 \\times 1,199,484 = 959,587.2\n     \\]\n   - The cost of the radiator after the discount is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Discounted Cost} = 1,199,484 - 959,587.2 = 239,896.8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Installation:**\n   - The mechanic charges $50 per hour and works for 3 hours.\n   - The total cost for the mechanic is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Installation Cost} = 3 \\times 50 = 150\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   - Add the discounted cost of the radiator and the installation cost to find the total amount Mark pays:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost} = 239,896.8 + 150 = 240,046.8\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mark pays is $240,046.8.\n\nFinal answer: <<<240046.8>>>"
