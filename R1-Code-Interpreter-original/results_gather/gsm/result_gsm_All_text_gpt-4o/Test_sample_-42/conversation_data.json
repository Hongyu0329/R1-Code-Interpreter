    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment after returning the faulty ones. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Value of Equipment Purchased:**\n   - The company bought equipment worth $4,326,221.\n\n2. **Determine the Proportion of Faulty Equipment:**\n   - 40% of the equipment was faulty.\n\n3. **Calculate the Value of Faulty Equipment:**\n   - To find the value of the faulty equipment, calculate 40% of the total purchase value.\n   - Faulty equipment value = 40% of $4,326,221 = 0.40 * $4,326,221.\n\n4. **Calculate the Value of Functioning Equipment:**\n   - The functioning equipment is the remaining 60% of the total equipment.\n   - Functioning equipment value = 60% of $4,326,221 = 0.60 * $4,326,221.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Amount Spent on Functioning Equipment:**\n   - Since the faulty equipment is returned, the company only spends money on the functioning equipment.\n   - Total amount spent = Value of functioning equipment.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n- Faulty equipment value = 0.40 * $4,326,221 = $1,730,488.40\n- Functioning equipment value = 0.60 * $4,326,221 = $2,595,732.60\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $2,595,732.60.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2595732.60>>>"
