    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water Crista needs for all her plants each day. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of plants and their water requirements:**\n   - Crista has a total of 20 plants.\n   - 4 of these plants need half a cup of water each.\n   - 6162513 plants need 1 cup of water each. This number is clearly incorrect because it exceeds the total number of plants Crista has. We need to assume this is a typographical error and that the number should be less than or equal to 20. Let's assume this is a mistake and that the number should be 6 plants (a reasonable assumption given the context).\n   - The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.\n\n2. **Calculate the water needed for each group of plants:**\n   - For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each: \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 0.5 = 2 \\text{ cups of water}\n     \\]\n   - For the 6 plants that need 1 cup of water each:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 1 = 6 \\text{ cups of water}\n     \\]\n   - The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. First, calculate how many plants are left:\n     \\[\n     20 - 4 - 6 = 10 \\text{ plants}\n     \\]\n     These 10 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 0.25 = 2.5 \\text{ cups of water}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add up the total amount of water needed:**\n   - Total water needed = Water for plants needing half a cup + Water for plants needing 1 cup + Water for plants needing a quarter cup:\n     \\[\n     2 + 6 + 2.5 = 10.5 \\text{ cups of water}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Crista needs a total of 10.5 cups of water every day for her plants.\n\nFinal answer: <<<10.5>>>"
