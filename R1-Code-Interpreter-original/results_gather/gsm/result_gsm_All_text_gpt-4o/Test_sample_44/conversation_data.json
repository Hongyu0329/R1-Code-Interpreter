    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the changes in the number of shoes Fireman Frank has throughout the week. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Shoes:**\n   - Fireman Frank starts with 3,495,007 shoes.\n\n2. **Monday:**\n   - He receives 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he receives \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) shoes.\n   - New total after Monday: \\(3,495,007 + 10 = 3,495,017\\) shoes.\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   - He gains 15 new pairs of shoes. This means he receives \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\) shoes.\n   - New total after Wednesday: \\(3,495,017 + 30 = 3,495,047\\) shoes.\n\n4. **Friday:**\n   - He gains 30 pairs of shoes. This means he receives \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\) shoes.\n   - New total after Friday: \\(3,495,047 + 60 = 3,495,107\\) shoes.\n\n5. **Saturday:**\n   - He gets rid of 180 shoes.\n   - New total after Saturday: \\(3,495,107 - 180 = 3,494,927\\) shoes.\n\n6. **Sunday:**\n   - No changes are mentioned for Sunday, so the total remains the same as after Saturday.\n\nTherefore, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 3,494,927.\n\nFinal answer: <<<3494927>>>"
