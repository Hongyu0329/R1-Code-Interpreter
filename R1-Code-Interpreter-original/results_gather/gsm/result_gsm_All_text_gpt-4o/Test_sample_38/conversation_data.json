    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce, given the information about the volume reduction and the number of tomatoes per can.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Volume Reduction**: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the final volume of the sauce is half of the initial volume of the canned tomatoes.\n\n2. **Canned Tomatoes**: Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.\n\n3. **Final Sauce Volume**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.\n\nNow, let's calculate the initial volume of canned tomatoes needed to make 32 ounces of sauce:\n\n- Since the sauce loses half its volume during cooking, the initial volume of canned tomatoes must be twice the final volume of the sauce.\n- Therefore, the initial volume of canned tomatoes = 2 * 32 ounces = 64 ounces.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes are required to get 64 ounces:\n\n- Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.\n- Number of cans needed = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of tomatoes used:\n\n- Each can contains 3 tomatoes.\n- Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.\n\nTherefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make her batch of tomato sauce.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<12>>>."
