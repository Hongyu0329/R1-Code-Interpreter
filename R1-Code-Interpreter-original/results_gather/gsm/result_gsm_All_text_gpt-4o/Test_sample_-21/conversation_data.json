    "To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to consider the total number of women wearing heels and the total height of all the heels combined. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the number of women wearing each type of heel:**\n   - 3 women are wearing 4-inch heels.\n   - 8,449,158 women are wearing 2-inch heels.\n\n2. **Calculate the total height contributed by each group:**\n   - For the women wearing 4-inch heels: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total height for 4-inch heels} = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - For the women wearing 2-inch heels:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total height for 2-inch heels} = 8,449,158 \\times 2 = 16,898,316 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total height of all heels combined:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total height of all heels} = 12 + 16,898,316 = 16,898,328 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of women wearing heels:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of women} = 3 + 8,449,158 = 8,449,161\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average height of heels:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average height} = \\frac{\\text{Total height of all heels}}{\\text{Total number of women}} = \\frac{16,898,328}{8,449,161}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Perform the division to find the average:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average height} \\approx 2.00000142 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average height of heels at the party is approximately 2.00000142 inches.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<2.00000142>>>"
