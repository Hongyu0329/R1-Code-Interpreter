    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Skyler's hats are white. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Hats**: Skyler has a total of 716646 hats.\n\n2. **Red Hats**: We are told that half of the hats are red. Therefore, the number of red hats is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Red hats} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 716646 = 358323\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remaining Hats After Red**: After accounting for the red hats, we need to find out how many hats are left. This is calculated by subtracting the number of red hats from the total number of hats:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining hats} = 716646 - 358323 = 358323\n   \\]\n\n4. **Blue Hats**: We are told that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. Therefore, the number of blue hats is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Blue hats} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 358323 = 214993.8\n   \\]\n   Since the number of hats must be a whole number, we round 214993.8 to the nearest whole number, which is 214994.\n\n5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:\n   \\[\n   \\text{White hats} = 358323 - 214994 = 143329\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is 143329.\n\nFinal answer: <<<143329>>>"
