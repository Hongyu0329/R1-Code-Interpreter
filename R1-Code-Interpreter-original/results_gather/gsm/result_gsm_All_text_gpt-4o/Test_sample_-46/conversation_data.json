    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Determine the number of students who went out through exit A:**\n   - Total number of students = 2,780,965.\n   - Percentage of students who went out through exit A = 30%.\n   - Number of students who went out through exit A = 30% of 2,780,965.\n   - Calculation: \\(0.30 \\times 2,780,965 = 834,289.5\\).\n   - Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 834,289.5 to 834,289.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A:**\n   - Remaining students = Total students - Students who went out through exit A.\n   - Calculation: \\(2,780,965 - 834,289 = 1,946,676\\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of students who went out through exit B:**\n   - Fraction of remaining students who went out through exit B = 3/5.\n   - Number of students who went out through exit B = \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 1,946,676\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(0.60 \\times 1,946,676 = 1,168,005.6\\).\n   - Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 1,168,005.6 to 1,168,006.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:**\n   - Remaining students after exits A and B = Students remaining after exit A - Students who went out through exit B.\n   - Calculation: \\(1,946,676 - 1,168,006 = 778,670\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 778,670.\n\nFinal answer: <<<778,670>>>."
