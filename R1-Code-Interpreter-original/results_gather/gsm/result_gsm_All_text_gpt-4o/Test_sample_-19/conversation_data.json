    "To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Ali ordered 2,182,736 kilos of coal. The coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, and each bag costs $18.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Bags Needed**:\n   - Each bag contains 50 kg of coal.\n   - Total kilos of coal ordered: 2,182,736 kg.\n   - To find the number of bags, divide the total kilos by the kilos per bag:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of bags} = \\frac{2,182,736 \\text{ kg}}{50 \\text{ kg/bag}} = 43,654.72\n     \\]\n   - Since you cannot have a fraction of a bag, you need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Ali needs 43,655 bags.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost**:\n   - Each bag costs $18.\n   - Total cost = Number of bags Ã— Cost per bag:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = 43,655 \\text{ bags} \\times 18 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 785,790 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The total cost of Ali's coal order is $785,790.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<785790>>>"
