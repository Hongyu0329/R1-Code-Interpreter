    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many white hats Skyler has. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Hats**: Skyler has a total of 716646 hats.\n\n2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red. \n   - Calculate the number of red hats: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Red hats} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 716646 = 358323\n     \\]\n\n3. **Remaining Hats After Red**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total to find the remaining hats.\n   - Calculate the remaining hats:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining hats} = 716646 - 358323 = 358323\n     \\]\n\n4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.\n   - Calculate the number of blue hats:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Blue hats} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 358323 = 214993.8\n     \\]\n   Since the number of hats must be a whole number, we round 214993.8 to the nearest whole number, which is 214994.\n\n5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white.\n   - Calculate the number of white hats:\n     \\[\n     \\text{White hats} = \\text{Remaining hats} - \\text{Blue hats} = 358323 - 214994 = 143329\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is 143329.\n\nFinal answer: <<<143329>>>"
