    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the combined weight of the two pennies: a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny.\n\n1. **Identify the weight of the 1959 penny:**\n   - The problem states that the 1959 penny weighs 5,244,240 grains.\n\n2. **Determine the weight of the 2010 penny:**\n   - According to the problem, the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.\n   - To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate three-quarters of the 1959 penny's weight:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 5,244,240\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:**\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{4} \\times 5,244,240 = 3,933,180 \\text{ grains}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies:**\n   - Add the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Combined weight} = 5,244,240 + 3,933,180\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform the addition:**\n   - \\[\n     5,244,240 + 3,933,180 = 9,177,420 \\text{ grains}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the combined weight of the two pennies is 9,177,420 grains.\n\nFinal answer: <<<9177420>>>"
