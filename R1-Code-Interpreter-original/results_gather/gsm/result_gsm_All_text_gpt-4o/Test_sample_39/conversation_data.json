    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults and compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the maximum load capacity of the elevator:**\n   - The elevator can support a maximum load of 700 kg.\n\n2. **Determine the average weight of an adult:**\n   - An adult weighs an average of 80 kg.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of people in the elevator:**\n   - Jack is riding the elevator with 8 other adults, so there are a total of 9 people in the elevator (Jack + 8 adults).\n\n4. **Calculate the total weight of all the people in the elevator:**\n   - Since each person weighs an average of 80 kg, the total weight of 9 people is:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ people} \\times 80 \\text{ kg/person} = 720 \\text{ kg}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compare the total weight to the maximum load capacity:**\n   - The total weight of 720 kg exceeds the maximum load capacity of 700 kg.\n\n6. **Calculate by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load:**\n   - The excess weight is:\n     \\[\n     720 \\text{ kg} - 700 \\text{ kg} = 20 \\text{ kg}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.\n\nFinal answer: <<<20>>>"
