    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in one week from her dance classes. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the number of classes per week:**\n   - Judy teaches 8387270 classes every weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week.\n   - Therefore, the total number of classes on weekdays is:  \n     \\( 8387270 \\text{ classes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 41936350 \\text{ classes} \\).\n\n   - On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.\n   - Therefore, the total number of classes in one week is:  \n     \\( 41936350 \\text{ classes} + 8 \\text{ classes} = 41936358 \\text{ classes} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the number of students per class:**\n   - Each class has 18387270 students.\n\n3. **Determine the charge per student:**\n   - Judy charges $18387270.00 per student.\n\n4. **Calculate the total earnings for one week:**\n   - First, calculate the earnings from one class:  \n     \\( 18387270 \\text{ students/class} \\times 18387270 \\text{ dollars/student} \\).\n\n   - Then, calculate the total earnings for all classes in one week:  \n     \\( 41936358 \\text{ classes} \\times (18387270 \\text{ students/class} \\times 18387270 \\text{ dollars/student}) \\).\n\n5. **Perform the calculations:**\n   - Earnings from one class:  \n     \\( 18387270 \\times 18387270 = 338118294744900 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\n   - Total earnings for the week:  \n     \\( 41936358 \\times 338118294744900 = 14179222956387198204200 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:\n\n<<<14179222956387198204200>>>"
