    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of item (robots, helmets, and footballs) and then sum them up to find the total number of items Dominick saw.\n\n1. **Identify the number of helmets:**\n   - The problem states that there are 20 helmets.\n\n2. **Determine the number of robots:**\n   - The problem states that there are half as many robots as helmets.\n   - Therefore, the number of robots is half of 20.\n   - Calculation: \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\)\n   - So, there are 10 robots.\n\n3. **Determine the number of footballs:**\n   - The problem states that there are half as many helmets as footballs.\n   - Since there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets.\n   - Calculation: \\( 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\)\n   - So, there are 40 footballs.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of items:**\n   - We need to sum the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.\n   - Total items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs\n   - Calculation: \\( 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70.\n\nFinal answer: <<<70>>>"
