    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.\n\n1. **Understand Joey's Weight Loss:**\n   - Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.\n   - Therefore, Joey's weight loss per week is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 2 \\text{ pounds per week}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Understand Sandy's Weight Loss Rate:**\n   - Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week.\n   - Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.\n\n3. **Calculate Sandy's Weekly Weight Loss:**\n   - Sandy's weight loss per week is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \\frac{2 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \\text{ pounds per week}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine How Long It Takes Sandy to Lose 8 Pounds:**\n   - We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds at her rate of 0.5 pounds per week.\n   - The number of weeks required is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{0.5 \\text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \\text{ weeks}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.\n\nFinal answer: <<<16>>>"
