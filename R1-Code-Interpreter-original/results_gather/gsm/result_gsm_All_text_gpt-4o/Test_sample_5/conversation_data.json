    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up to find the total number of crabs.\n\n1. **Identify Bo's Crabs:**\n   - We are given that Bo has 7,487,762 crabs.\n\n2. **Determine Monic's Crabs:**\n   - Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.\n   - Therefore, the number of crabs Monic has is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Monic's crabs} = \\text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 7,487,762 - 4 = 7,487,758\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Rani's Crabs:**\n   - Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.\n   - Therefore, the number of crabs Rani has is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rani's crabs} = \\text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 7,487,758 + 10 = 7,487,768\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Crabs:**\n   - Add the number of crabs each person has:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total crabs} = \\text{Bo's crabs} + \\text{Monic's crabs} + \\text{Rani's crabs}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the values we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total crabs} = 7,487,762 + 7,487,758 + 7,487,768\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - First, add Bo's and Monic's crabs:\n     \\[\n     7,487,762 + 7,487,758 = 14,975,520\n     \\]\n   - Then, add Rani's crabs to the result:\n     \\[\n     14,975,520 + 7,487,768 = 22,463,288\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of crabs the three have together is 22,463,288.\n\nFinal answer: <<<22463288>>>"
