    "To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of zebras and their stripes:**\n   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each.\n   - One zebra with 3,009,606 stripes.\n   - One zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of stripes:**\n   - For the two zebras with 17 stripes each: \\(2 \\times 17 = 34\\) stripes.\n   - For the zebra with 3,009,606 stripes: 3,009,606 stripes.\n   - For the zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes: \\(\\frac{3,009,606}{2} = 1,504,803\\) stripes.\n\n3. **Sum the total number of stripes:**\n   - Total stripes = 34 (from the two zebras) + 3,009,606 (from the third zebra) + 1,504,803 (from the fourth zebra).\n   - Total stripes = 34 + 3,009,606 + 1,504,803 = 4,514,443 stripes.\n\n4. **Count the total number of zebras:**\n   - There are 2 zebras with 17 stripes each, 1 zebra with 3,009,606 stripes, and 1 zebra with half of 3,009,606 stripes.\n   - Total number of zebras = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 zebras.\n\n5. **Calculate the average number of stripes per zebra:**\n   - Average stripes = Total stripes / Total number of zebras.\n   - Average stripes = 4,514,443 / 4 = 1,128,610.75 stripes.\n\nTherefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is:\n\n<<<1128610.75>>>"
