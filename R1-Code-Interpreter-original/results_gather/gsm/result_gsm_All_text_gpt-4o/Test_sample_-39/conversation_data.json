    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined weight of the two pennies: a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The 1959 penny weighs 5244240 grains.\n2. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.\n\nLet's break down the steps to find the combined weight:\n\n1. **Identify the weight of the 1959 penny:**\n   - The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 5244240 grains.\n\n2. **Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:**\n   - The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.\n   - To find the weight of the 2010 penny, multiply the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.\n   - Weight of the 2010 penny = 5244240 grains * (3/4).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - Calculate 5244240 * (3/4) = 3933180 grains.\n\n4. **Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies:**\n   - Add the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny.\n   - Combined weight = 5244240 grains + 3933180 grains.\n\n5. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Combined weight = 9177420 grains.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 9177420 grains.\n\nFinal answer: <<<9177420>>>"
