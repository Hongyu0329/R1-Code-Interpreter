    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10% due to his new diet. We know the following:\n\n1. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.\n2. Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Determine Gerald's Original Time:**\n   - Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:\n     - Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds\n     - Gerald's original time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds\n\n2. **Calculate Gerald's Improved Time:**\n   - Gerald improved his speed by 10% due to his new diet. This means his time to complete the 400-meter hurdles is reduced by 10%.\n   - To find the new time, we need to calculate 10% of Gerald's original time and subtract it from his original time.\n   - 10% of Gerald's original time = 10% of 40 seconds = 0.10 * 40 seconds = 4 seconds\n   - Gerald's improved time = Gerald's original time - 10% of Gerald's original time\n   - Gerald's improved time = 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds\n\nTherefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.\n\nFinal answer: <<<36>>>"
