    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches, given the information about Topher's shoe length.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**\n   - Topher's shoe length is given in feet and inches: 8 feet and 4 inches.\n   - We need to convert this measurement entirely into inches for consistency.\n\n2. **Convert Topher's Shoe Length to Inches:**\n   - 1 foot = 12 inches.\n   - Therefore, 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches.\n   - Adding the additional 4 inches, Topher's shoe length is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.\n   - The equation based on the problem statement is: \n     \\[\n     100 = 9x + 10\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     100 - 10 = 9x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     90 = 9x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{90}{9} = 10\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<10>>>."
