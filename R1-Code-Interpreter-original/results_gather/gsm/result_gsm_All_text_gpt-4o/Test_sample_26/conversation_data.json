    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals for both the orchids and the African daisies, and then find the difference between them.\n\n1. **Identify the number of each type of flower:**\n   - Joelle has 5 orchids.\n   - Joelle has 8,516,550 African daisies.\n\n2. **Determine the number of petals per flower:**\n   - Each orchid has 5 petals.\n   - Each African daisy has 10 petals.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:**\n   - Total petals from orchids = Number of orchids × Petals per orchid\n   - Total petals from orchids = 5 × 5 = 25 petals\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:**\n   - Total petals from daisies = Number of daisies × Petals per daisy\n   - Total petals from daisies = 8,516,550 × 10 = 85,165,500 petals\n\n5. **Find the difference in the number of petals:**\n   - Difference in petals = Total petals from daisies - Total petals from orchids\n   - Difference in petals = 85,165,500 - 25 = 85,165,475 petals\n\nTherefore, the African daisies have 85,165,475 more petals compared to the orchids.\n\nFinal answer: <<<85165475>>>"
