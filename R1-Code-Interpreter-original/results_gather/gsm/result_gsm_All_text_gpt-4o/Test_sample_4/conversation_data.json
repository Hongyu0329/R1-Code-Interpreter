    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pink gumballs based on the given relationship with the number of blue gumballs.\n\n1. **Identify the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( b \\) represent the number of blue gumballs.\n   - Let \\( p \\) represent the number of pink gumballs.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationship:**\n   - The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs.\n   - This can be expressed as an equation: \n     \\[\n     p = 4b + 22\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the Given Value:**\n   - We are given that the number of blue gumballs \\( b \\) is 9913180.\n   - Substitute this value into the equation:\n     \\[\n     p = 4 \\times 9913180 + 22\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - First, calculate \\( 4 \\times 9913180 \\):\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 9913180 = 39652720\n     \\]\n   - Then, add 22 to the result:\n     \\[\n     p = 39652720 + 22 = 39652742\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of pink gumballs is 39652742.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<39652742>>>"
