    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Farmer Brown's animals are chickens. We know the following:\n\n1. The total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 3,016,226.\n2. The total number of legs is 70.\n\nWe also know:\n- Chickens have 2 legs each.\n- Cows have 4 legs each.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( C \\) as the number of chickens.\n- \\( W \\) as the number of cows.\n\nFrom the information given, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1. \\( C + W = 3,016,226 \\) (total number of animals)\n2. \\( 2C + 4W = 70 \\) (total number of legs)\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the second equation.**\n\nThe second equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by 2:\n\n\\[ C + 2W = 35 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve the system of equations.**\n\nWe have the system of equations:\n\n1. \\( C + W = 3,016,226 \\)\n2. \\( C + 2W = 35 \\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n\\[ (C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 3,016,226 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ W = 35 - 3,016,226 \\]\n\n\\[ W = -3,016,191 \\]\n\nThis result is not possible because the number of cows cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the assumptions, as the total number of legs (70) is not consistent with the number of animals (3,016,226) having either 2 or 4 legs.\n\nGiven the constraints, it is impossible to have 3,016,226 animals with only 70 legs. Therefore, the problem as stated does not have a feasible solution under normal circumstances.\n\nThe final answer, considering the impossibility of the situation, is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
