    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing based on the information given. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the time spent on each activity:**\n   - Boating: 6 hours\n   - Swimming: Half of the boating time, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows, each 2 hours, so \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent on these activities:**\n   - Total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows: \\( 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\) hours\n\n3. **Determine the total vacation time based on the shows:**\n   - The time spent watching shows (6 hours) is 30% of the total vacation time.\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the total vacation time. Then, \\( 0.3T = 6 \\).\n   - Solve for \\( T \\): \n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{6}{0.3} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing accounts for 40% of the total vacation time.\n   - Time spent sightseeing: \\( 0.4 \\times 20 = 8 \\) hours\n\nTherefore, the time John spent sightseeing is 8 hours.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<8>>>."
