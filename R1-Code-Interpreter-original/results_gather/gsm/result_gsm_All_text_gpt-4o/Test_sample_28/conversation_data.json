  "question": "Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag.  The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of basketballs based on the information given about how many each boy carried.\n\n1. **Understand the relationships:**\n   - Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.\n   - Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.\n\n2. **Define variables:**\n   - Let \\( J \\) be the number of balls Jordan carried.\n   - Let \\( A \\) be the number of balls Jason carried.\n   - Let \\( F \\) be the number of balls Jeffrey carried.\n\n3. **Set up equations based on the relationships:**\n   - From the problem, we know \\( A = 6752769 \\).\n   - Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason: \\( J = 2A \\).\n   - Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey: \\( A = 2F \\).\n\n4. **Solve for each variable:**\n   - Since \\( A = 6752769 \\), we can find \\( F \\) using \\( A = 2F \\):\n     \\[\n     F = \\frac{A}{2} = \\frac{6752769}{2} = 3376384.5\n     \\]\n   - Jeffrey cannot carry a fractional number of balls, so there might be a mistake in the problem setup or interpretation. However, let's proceed with the calculation.\n   - Calculate \\( J \\) using \\( J = 2A \\):\n     \\[\n     J = 2 \\times 6752769 = 13505538\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of balls:**\n   - The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total balls} = J + A + F = 13505538 + 6752769 + 3376384.5\n     \\]\n   - This results in a non-integer total, which suggests an error in the problem setup or assumptions. However, based on the calculations:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total balls} = 23634691.5\n     \\]\n\nGiven the fractional result, it seems there might be an inconsistency in the problem's assumptions or setup. However, based on the calculations, the total number of balls is:\n\n<<<23634691.5>>>"
