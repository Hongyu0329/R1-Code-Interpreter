    "To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total calories burned during aerobics:**\n   - Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.\n   - The rate of calories burned during aerobics is 500 calories per hour.\n   - Total calories burned during aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.\n\n2. **Calculate the total calories burned during running:**\n   - Hannah spends 1 hour running.\n   - The rate of calories burned during running is 600 calories per hour.\n   - Total calories burned during running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.\n\n3. **Calculate the total calories burned:**\n   - Total calories burned = Calories burned during aerobics + Calories burned during running.\n   - Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.\n\n4. **Determine the amount of water needed:**\n   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.\n   - To find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories, we set up a proportion:\n     - 200 calories : 100 ml = 1600 calories : X ml\n   - Solving for X, we get:\n     - X = (1600 calories * 100 ml) / 200 calories\n     - X = 160000 ml / 200\n     - X = 800 ml\n\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.\n\nFinal answer: <<<800>>>"
