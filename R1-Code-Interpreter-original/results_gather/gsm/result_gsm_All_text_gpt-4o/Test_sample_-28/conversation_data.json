    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Quantity of Oranges:**\n   - Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.\n\n2. **Distribution to Daughters:**\n   - Jennifer has three daughters.\n   - Each daughter received 2 oranges.\n   - Total oranges given to daughters = 3 daughters Ã— 2 oranges each = 6 oranges.\n\n3. **Distribution to Son:**\n   - Jennifer has one son.\n   - Her son received 1,277,771 oranges.\n\n4. **Total Oranges Given Away:**\n   - Total oranges given to daughters = 6 oranges.\n   - Total oranges given to son = 1,277,771 oranges.\n   - Total oranges given away = 6 + 1,277,771 = 1,277,777 oranges.\n\n5. **Remaining Oranges:**\n   - Jennifer initially had 12 oranges.\n   - She gave away a total of 1,277,777 oranges.\n   - Remaining oranges = Initial oranges - Total oranges given away = 12 - 1,277,777.\n\n6. **Calculation of Remaining Oranges:**\n   - 12 - 1,277,777 = -1,277,765.\n\nTherefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remains with is a negative number, indicating that she gave away more oranges than she initially had.\n\nFinal answer: <<<-1277765>>>."
