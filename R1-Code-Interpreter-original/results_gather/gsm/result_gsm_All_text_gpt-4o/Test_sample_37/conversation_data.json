    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total age of all the siblings in the family, which includes 2 brothers and 2,620,008 sisters. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the ages of the sisters:**\n   - There are 2,620,008 sisters.\n   - Each sister is 16 years old.\n\n2. **Calculate the total age of all the sisters:**\n   - Total age of all sisters = Number of sisters × Age of each sister\n   - Total age of all sisters = 2,620,008 × 16\n\n3. **Identify the ages of the brothers:**\n   - One brother is 12 years old.\n   - The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother.\n   - Therefore, the older brother is 12 × 2 = 24 years old.\n\n4. **Calculate the total age of the brothers:**\n   - Total age of the brothers = Age of younger brother + Age of older brother\n   - Total age of the brothers = 12 + 24\n\n5. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**\n   - Total age of all siblings = Total age of all sisters + Total age of the brothers\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n- Total age of all sisters = 2,620,008 × 16 = 41,920,128\n- Total age of the brothers = 12 + 24 = 36\n- Total age of all siblings = 41,920,128 + 36 = 41,920,164\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings is:\n\n<<<41920164>>>"
