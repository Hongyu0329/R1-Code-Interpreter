    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs each child receives when three dozen eggs are distributed equally among four children. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Quantity of Eggs:**\n   - A dozen is equal to 12. Therefore, three dozen eggs is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ eggs}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Distribute the Eggs Equally:**\n   - The total number of eggs (36) needs to be divided equally among the four children. This means we need to perform the division:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n     \\]\n\n3. **Result Interpretation:**\n   - Each child receives 9 eggs.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined that each child receives 9 eggs.\n\nFinal answer: <<<9>>>"
