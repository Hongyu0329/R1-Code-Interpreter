    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water Crista needs for all her plants each day. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of plants and their water needs:**\n   - Crista has a total of 20 plants.\n   - 4 of these plants need half a cup of water each.\n   - 6162513 plants need 1 cup of water each. This number seems incorrect because it exceeds the total number of plants Crista has. We will assume this is a typographical error and should be ignored for the calculation.\n   - The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.\n\n2. **Calculate the water needed for each group of plants:**\n   - For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ plants} \\times 0.5 \\text{ cups/plant} = 2 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of plants needing a quarter cup of water:**\n   - Since 4 plants need half a cup of water, the remaining plants are:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ total plants} - 4 \\text{ plants needing half a cup} = 16 \\text{ plants}\n     \\]\n   - These 16 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.\n\n4. **Calculate the water needed for the remaining plants:**\n   - For the 16 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water each:\n     \\[\n     16 \\text{ plants} \\times 0.25 \\text{ cups/plant} = 4 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Add up the total water needed:**\n   - Total water needed is the sum of the water for both groups of plants:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ cups} + 4 \\text{ cups} = 6 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Crista needs a total of 6 cups of water every day for her plants.\n\nFinal answer: <<<6>>>"
