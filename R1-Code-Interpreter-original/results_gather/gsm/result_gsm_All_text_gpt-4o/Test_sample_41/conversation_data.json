    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls in the school given that 40% of the school population consists of boys. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - 40% of the school population is made up of boys.\n   - The number of boys is 560,233.\n\n2. **Determine the Total School Population:**\n   - Since 40% of the school population is boys, we can express this as:\n     \\[\n     0.40 \\times \\text{Total Population} = 560,233\n     \\]\n   - To find the total population, rearrange the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Population} = \\frac{560,233}{0.40}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total School Population:**\n   - Perform the division:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Population} = \\frac{560,233}{0.40} = 1,400,582.5\n     \\]\n   - Since the population must be a whole number, this suggests that the given data might be rounded or approximate. However, for the purpose of this calculation, we will use the exact division result.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Girls:**\n   - If 40% of the population is boys, then 60% of the population is girls.\n   - Calculate the number of girls:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of Girls} = 0.60 \\times \\text{Total Population}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the total population:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of Girls} = 0.60 \\times 1,400,582.5 = 840,349.5\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the Number of Girls:**\n   - Since the number of girls must be a whole number, round 840,349.5 to the nearest whole number:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of Girls} = 840,350\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of girls in the school is approximately 840,350.\n\nFinal answer: <<<840,350>>>"
