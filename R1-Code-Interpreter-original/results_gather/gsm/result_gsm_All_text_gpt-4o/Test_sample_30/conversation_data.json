    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze each part of the question and perform the necessary calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Cost of the Bedroom Set:**\n   - Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000.\n\n2. **Selling the Old Bedroom Set:**\n   - Tom sells his old bedroom set for $9002017. This amount is used to pay for part of the new bedroom set.\n\n3. **Calculating the Remaining Balance:**\n   - Since Tom sells his old bedroom set for $9002017, which is significantly more than the cost of the new bedroom set ($3000), he can fully pay for the new set and still have money left over.\n   - Calculate the remaining balance after paying for the new bedroom set:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Balance} = \\text{Amount from Old Bedroom Set} - \\text{Cost of New Bedroom Set}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Balance} = 9002017 - 3000 = 8999017\n     \\]\n\n4. **Monthly Payment Calculation:**\n   - The problem states that Tom has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set. However, since he has already paid off the entire cost of the bedroom set with the sale of his old set, there is no remaining balance to pay off.\n   - Therefore, the monthly payment is 0 because the entire cost has been covered.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Tom does not need to make any monthly payments because the sale of his old bedroom set more than covers the cost of the new set.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
