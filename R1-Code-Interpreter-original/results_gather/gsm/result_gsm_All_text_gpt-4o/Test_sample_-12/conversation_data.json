    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls in the school given that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and there are 560,233 boys.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the percentage given**: \n   - We know that 40% of the school population consists of boys. This means that the remaining percentage, which is 100% - 40% = 60%, consists of girls.\n\n2. **Determine the total school population**:\n   - If 40% of the school population is 560,233 boys, we can set up an equation to find the total population. Let \\( T \\) be the total school population.\n   - Since 40% of \\( T \\) is 560,233, we can write the equation: \n     \\[\n     0.40 \\times T = 560,233\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( T \\), divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{560,233}{0.40}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total school population**:\n   - Perform the division:\n     \\[\n     T = 1,400,582.5\n     \\]\n   - Since the total population must be a whole number, we round 1,400,582.5 to 1,400,583.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of girls**:\n   - We know that 60% of the total population consists of girls.\n   - Calculate the number of girls by taking 60% of the total population:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \\times 1,400,583\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform the calculation**:\n   - Multiply to find the number of girls:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of girls} = 840,349.8\n     \\]\n   - Since the number of girls must also be a whole number, we round 840,349.8 to 840,350.\n\nTherefore, the number of girls in the school is:\n\n<<<840350>>>"
