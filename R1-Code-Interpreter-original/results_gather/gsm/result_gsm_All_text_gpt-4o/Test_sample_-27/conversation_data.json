    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals for both the orchids and the African daisies and then find the difference between them.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of petals for the orchids.\n- Joelle has 5 orchids.\n- Each orchid has 5 petals.\n- Total petals from orchids = Number of orchids × Petals per orchid = 5 × 5 = 25 petals.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies.\n- Joelle has 8,516,550 African daisies.\n- Each daisy has 10 petals.\n- Total petals from daisies = Number of daisies × Petals per daisy = 8,516,550 × 10 = 85,165,500 petals.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids.\n- Difference in petals = Total petals from daisies - Total petals from orchids = 85,165,500 - 25 = 85,165,475 petals.\n\nTherefore, the African daisies have 85,165,475 more petals compared to the orchids.\n\nFinal answer: <<<85165475>>>"
