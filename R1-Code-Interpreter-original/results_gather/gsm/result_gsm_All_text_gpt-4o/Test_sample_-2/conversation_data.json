    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many vines Steve needs to grow to satisfy his and his girlfriend's tomato consumption. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Determine Steve's Daily Consumption:**\n   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.\n\n2. **Determine Girlfriend's Daily Consumption:**\n   - Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. Therefore, if Steve eats 6 tomatoes, his girlfriend eats half of that amount.\n   - Girlfriend's daily consumption = 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Daily Consumption:**\n   - Total daily consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend = Steve's consumption + Girlfriend's consumption.\n   - Total daily consumption = 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day.\n\n4. **Calculate Weekly Consumption:**\n   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption.\n   - Weekly consumption = 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes per week.\n\n5. **Determine Tomato Production per Vine:**\n   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.\n\n6. **Calculate Number of Vines Needed:**\n   - To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the production per vine.\n   - Number of vines needed = 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.\n\nTherefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet the tomato consumption needs for both himself and his girlfriend.\n\nFinal answer: <<<21>>>"
