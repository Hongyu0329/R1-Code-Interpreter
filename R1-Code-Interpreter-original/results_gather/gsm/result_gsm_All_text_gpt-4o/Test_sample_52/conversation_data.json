    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by both Jon and James for the triathlon and then determine how long it took James to complete the run.\n\n1. **Calculate Jon's Total Time:**\n   - Swim: 40 minutes\n   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes\n   - Run: 50 minutes\n   - Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes\n\n2. **Calculate James's Swim Time:**\n   - James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon.\n   - Jon's swim time = 40 minutes\n   - 10% of 40 minutes = 0.10 * 40 = 4 minutes\n   - James's swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes\n\n3. **Calculate James's Bike Time:**\n   - James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon for the bike ride.\n   - Jon's bike time = 80 minutes\n   - James's bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes\n\n4. **Determine the Total Time Difference:**\n   - Jon won by 10 minutes, meaning James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's.\n   - Jon's total time = 170 minutes\n   - James's total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes\n\n5. **Calculate James's Run Time:**\n   - We know James's total time and the time he took for the swim and bike.\n   - James's total time = 180 minutes\n   - James's swim time = 36 minutes\n   - James's bike time = 85 minutes\n   - James's run time = Total time - Swim time - Bike time\n   - James's run time = 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes\n\nTherefore, it took James 59 minutes to complete the run.\n\nFinal answer: <<<59>>>"
