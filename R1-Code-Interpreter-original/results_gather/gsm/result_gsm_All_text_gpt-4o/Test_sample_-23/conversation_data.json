    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze each part of the question and perform the necessary calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Cost of the Bedroom Set:**\n   - Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000.\n\n2. **Selling the Old Bedroom Set:**\n   - Tom sells his old bedroom set for $9002017. This amount is used to pay for part of the new bedroom set.\n\n3. **Calculating the Remaining Balance:**\n   - Since Tom sells his old bedroom set for $9002017, which is significantly more than the cost of the new bedroom set ($3000), he can fully pay for the new bedroom set with the money from the sale.\n   - Therefore, the remaining balance after using the sale proceeds is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Balance} = 3000 - 9002017 = -9000017\n     \\]\n   - This means Tom has an excess of $9000017 after paying for the new bedroom set.\n\n4. **Monthly Payment Calculation:**\n   - The problem states that Tom has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set. However, since he has already overpaid by $9000017, there is no remaining balance to apply the 10% monthly payment to.\n   - Therefore, the monthly payment is effectively $0 because there is no outstanding balance.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Tom does not need to make any monthly payments because he has already covered the cost of the bedroom set and has an excess amount.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly Payment} = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<0>>>."
