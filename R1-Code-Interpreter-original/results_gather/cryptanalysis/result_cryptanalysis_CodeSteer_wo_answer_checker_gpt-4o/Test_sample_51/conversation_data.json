    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 1, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This means one of the numbers is either 5 or 2, but not both.\n   - From guess 2, both numbers are incorrect and too small, so 0 and 2 are not in the password.\n   - From guess 3, both numbers are incorrect, so 3 and 7 are not in the password.\n   - From guess 4, both numbers are incorrect, so 1 and 7 are not in the password.\n   - From guess 5, both numbers are incorrect and too large, so 7 and 9 are not in the password.\n   - From guess 6, both numbers are incorrect, so 9 and 1 are not in the password.\n   - From guess 7, both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions, so 5 and 6 are the numbers in the password.\n   - From guess 8, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large, confirming 6 is correct and 7 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, both numbers are incorrect and too small, confirming 3 and 1 are not in the password.\n   - From guess 10, both numbers are incorrect, confirming 9 and 4 are not in the password.\n\n   From this, we deduce the numbers are 5 and 6.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1, both letters are incorrect, so F and R are not in the password.\n   - From guess 2, both letters are incorrect, so I and T are not in the password.\n   - From guess 3, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so A and O are not in the password.\n   - From guess 4, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so F and J are not in the password.\n   - From guess 5, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so N is incorrect, and P is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 6, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so C and K are not in the password.\n   - From guess 7, both letters are incorrect, so S and M are not in the password.\n   - From guess 8, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so B and J are not in the password.\n   - From guess 9, both letters are incorrect, so R and G are not in the password.\n   - From guess 10, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so A is incorrect, and V is correct and in the correct position.\n\n   From this, we deduce the letters are P and V, with V in the second position.\n\nCombining these deductions, the password is 65PV.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"6\", \"5\", \"P\", \"V\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```"
