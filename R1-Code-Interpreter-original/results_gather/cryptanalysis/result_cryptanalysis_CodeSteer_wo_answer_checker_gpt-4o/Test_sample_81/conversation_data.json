    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10, we know that the numbers 0, 1, 2, 7, 9, and any number greater than 7 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, we know that one number is correct and one is incorrect and too large. Since 9 is too large, 6 must be correct.\n   - From guess 11, both numbers 0 and 9 are incorrect, confirming that 6 is correct.\n   - The only remaining possible numbers are 3, 4, 5, and 8. Since 4 and 5 are incorrect (from guess 7), the second number must be 3 or 8.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10, we know that the letters G, F, Y, C, S, V, E, W, and any letter earlier than G are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, both letters C and L are incorrect and too early, so the letters must be later than L.\n   - From guess 11, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late. Since R is too late, X must be correct.\n   - The only remaining possible letters are M, N, O, P, Q, and X. Since X is correct, the other letter must be M, N, O, or P.\n\n3. **Final Deduction:**\n   - The numbers are 6 and 3 or 8.\n   - The letters are X and one of M, N, O, or P.\n   - From guess 6, since 6 is correct and 9 is too large, the second number must be 3.\n   - From guess 11, X is correct, and R is too late, so the other letter must be M, N, O, or P.\n\nThus, the password is 63XN.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"6\", \"3\", \"X\", \"N\"]\nprint(password)\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more complex and systematic approach, we can use a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) approach. We'll use Python's `itertools` to generate combinations and filter them based on the given constraints. This approach will ensure that all conditions are thoroughly evaluated.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Define Possible Values:**\n   - Numbers: 0-9\n   - Letters: A-Z\n\n2. **Filter Based on Constraints:**\n   - Use the feedback from each guess to eliminate impossible values.\n   - Use itertools to generate combinations of numbers and letters.\n   - Check each combination against the constraints.\n\n3. **Implement the Solution:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate over possible combinations.\n   - Apply each constraint to filter out invalid combinations.\n   - Print the valid combination that satisfies all constraints.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Possible numbers and letters\nnumbers = '0123456789'\nletters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n# Constraints based on feedback\ndef is_valid_combination(num1, num2, let1, let2):\n    # Convert numbers to integers for comparison\n    n1, n2 = int(num1), int(num2)\n    \n    # Check each condition\n    conditions = [\n        (n1 != 9 and n2 != 7 and let1 != 'Y' and let2 != 'S'),\n        (n1 != 7 and n2 != 0 and let1 > 'G' and let2 > 'F'),\n        (n1 != 1 and n2 != 7 and let1 != 'Y' and let2 != 'C'),\n        (n1 != 7 and n2 != 2 and let1 != 'X' and let2 != 'P'),\n        (n1 > 2 and n2 > 2 and let1 != 'S' and let2 != 'V'),\n        ((n1 == 6 or n2 == 6) and (n1 < 9 and n2 < 9) and let1 > 'C' and let2 > 'L'),\n        (n1 != 5 and n2 != 4 and let1 != 'E' and let2 != 'W'),\n        (n1 > 2 and n2 > 2 and let1 != 'X' and let2 != 'S'),\n        (n1 > 1 and n2 > 1 and let1 > 'G' and let2 > 'F'),\n        (n1 != 4 and n2 != 0 and let1 != 'G' and let2 != 'U'),\n        (n1 != 0 and n2 != 9 and let1 == 'X' and let2 < 'R')\n    ]\n    \n    return all(conditions)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters\nfor num1, num2 in itertools.permutations(numbers, 2):\n    for let1, let2 in itertools.permutations(letters, 2):\n        if is_valid_combination(num1, num2, let1, let2):\n            print([num1, num2, let1, let2])\n            break\n```\n\nThis code systematically checks all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters, applying the constraints from the feedback to find the valid combination. The `is_valid_combination` function checks each condition, and the loop iterates over permutations of numbers and letters to find the correct password."
