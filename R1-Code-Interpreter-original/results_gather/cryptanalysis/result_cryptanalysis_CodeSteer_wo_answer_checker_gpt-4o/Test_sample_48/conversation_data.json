    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use the process of elimination to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From Guess 1 (57RU): Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 2 (26ZE): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too small. This means one of 2 or 6 is correct.\n   - From Guess 3 (01TK): Both numbers are incorrect and too small. This means the numbers are greater than 1 and 0.\n   - From Guess 4 (56GR): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too small. This means 6 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From Guess 5 (25XY): Both numbers are incorrect and too small. This means the numbers are greater than 2 and 5.\n   - From Guess 6 (94KA): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too small. This means 9 is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n   From the above, the numbers must be 6 and 9, with 6 in the second position and 9 in the first position.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From Guess 1 (57RU): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 2 (26ZE): One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too early. This means E is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From Guess 3 (01TK): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 4 (56GR): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 5 (25XY): One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. This means Y is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From Guess 6 (94KA): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From the above, the letters must be Y and E, with Y in the first position and E in the second position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct password is 96YE.\n\n```python\n# Output the deduced password\npassword = [\"9\", \"6\", \"Y\", \"E\"]\nprint(password)\n```",
    "To solve this problem with a more sophisticated approach, we can use a systematic algorithm that involves:\n\n1. **Tracking Possible Values:** Use sets to keep track of possible numbers and letters for each position.\n2. **Iterative Refinement:** Apply the feedback from each guess to iteratively refine the possible values.\n3. **Logical Deductions:** Use logical deductions to eliminate impossible values and confirm correct ones.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\n# Initialize possible values for each position\npossible_numbers = [set(range(10)), set(range(10))]\npossible_letters = [set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'), set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')]\n\n# Process each guess and feedback\nguesses = [\n    (\"57RU\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"26ZE\", \"one number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"01TK\", \"both numbers are incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"56GR\", \"one number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"25XY\", \"both numbers are incorrect and too small; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and incorrect.\"),\n    (\"94KA\", \"one number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\")\n]\n\nfor guess, feedback in guesses:\n    numbers = [int(guess[0]), int(guess[1])]\n    letters = [guess[2], guess[3]]\n\n    if \"both numbers are incorrect\" in feedback:\n        for i in range(2):\n            possible_numbers[i].discard(numbers[i])\n    if \"one number is correct but in the wrong position\" in feedback:\n        for i in range(2):\n            possible_numbers[1-i].add(numbers[i])\n            possible_numbers[i].discard(numbers[i])\n    if \"one number is incorrect and too small\" in feedback:\n        for i in range(2):\n            if numbers[i] in possible_numbers[i]:\n                possible_numbers[i] = {n for n in possible_numbers[i] if n > numbers[i]}\n    if \"both numbers are incorrect and too small\" in feedback:\n        for i in range(2):\n            possible_numbers[i] = {n for n in possible_numbers[i] if n > numbers[i]}\n\n    if \"both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet\" in feedback:\n        for i in range(2):\n            possible_letters[i] = {l for l in possible_letters[i] if l > letters[i]}\n    if \"one letter is correct and in the correct position\" in feedback:\n        for i in range(2):\n            if \"correct and in the correct position\" in feedback.split(\";\")[i+2]:\n                possible_letters[i] = {letters[i]}\n    if \"one letter is correct but in the wrong position\" in feedback:\n        for i in range(2):\n            if \"correct but in the wrong position\" in feedback.split(\";\")[i+2]:\n                possible_letters[1-i].add(letters[i])\n                possible_letters[i].discard(letters[i])\n\n# Deduce the final password\nfinal_numbers = [next(iter(possible_numbers[i])) for i in range(2)]\nfinal_letters = [next(iter(possible_letters[i])) for i in range(2)]\n\n# Output the deduced password\npassword = [str(final_numbers[0]), str(final_numbers[1]), final_letters[0], final_letters[1]]\nprint(password)\n```\n\nThis code uses sets to track possible values for each position and iteratively refines these sets based on the feedback from each guess.
