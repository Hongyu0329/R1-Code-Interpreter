    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and its feedback to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the correct numbers and letters.\n\n1. **Guess: 27JR** - Both numbers and letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 2, 7 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: J, R are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 67GP** - Both numbers are incorrect and too large; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 6, 7 are incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: G is correct but in the wrong position; P is incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 09CO** - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 0 is correct but in the wrong position; 9 is incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: C, O are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 57VJ** - Both numbers are incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 5, 7 are incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: V, J are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 06HO** - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 0 is correct but in the wrong position; 6 is incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: H, O are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 67JQ** - Both numbers are incorrect and too large; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 6, 7 are incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: J is incorrect; Q is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n7. **Guess: 34TS** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Numbers: 3 is correct and in the correct position; 4 is incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: T, S are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- The correct numbers are 0 and 3. Since 3 is in the correct position in guess 7, the first number is 3 and the second number is 0.\n- The correct letters are G and Q. From guess 2, G is in the wrong position, so it should be the second letter. From guess 6, Q is in the wrong position, so it should be the first letter.\n\nThus, the password is 3, 0, Q, G.\n\n```python\npassword = [\"3\", \"0\", \"Q\", \"G\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To systematically evaluate all possible combinations of numbers and letters, we can implement a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) approach. This involves generating all possible combinations of numbers and letters, then applying the constraints from each guess to eliminate invalid combinations. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the possible numbers and letters**: Based on the feedback, we know the numbers are between 0 and 9, and the letters are from the alphabet.\n\n2. **Generate all possible combinations**: Create a list of all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters.\n\n3. **Apply constraints**: For each guess, apply the feedback constraints to eliminate invalid combinations.\n\n4. **Identify the correct combination**: The remaining combination(s) after applying all constraints should be the correct password.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on feedback\npossible_numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']\npossible_letters = [chr(i) for i in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1)]\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters\nall_combinations = [\n    (n1, n2, l1, l2)\n    for n1, n2 in permutations(possible_numbers, 2)\n    for l1, l2 in permutations(possible_letters, 2)\n]\n\n# Function to check if a combination satisfies all constraints\ndef satisfies_constraints(combination):\n    n1, n2, l1, l2 = combination\n    \n    # Apply constraints from each guess\n    # Guess 1: 27JR\n    if n1 in '27' or n2 in '27' or l1 in 'JR' or l2 in 'JR':\n        return False\n    \n    # Guess 2: 67GP\n    if n1 in '67' or n2 in '67' or (l1 == 'G' and l2 != 'P') or (l2 == 'G' and l1 != 'P'):\n        return False\n    \n    # Guess 3: 09CO\n    if (n1 == '0' and n2 == '9') or (n2 == '0' and n1 == '9') or l1 in 'CO' or l2 in 'CO':\n        return False\n    \n    # Guess 4: 57VJ\n    if n1 in '57' or n2 in '57' or l1 in 'VJ' or l2 in 'VJ':\n        return False\n    \n    # Guess 5: 06HO\n    if (n1 == '0' and n2 == '6') or (n2 == '0' and n1 == '6') or l1 in 'HO' or l2 in 'HO':\n        return False\n    \n    # Guess 6: 67JQ\n    if n1 in '67' or n2 in '67' or (l1 == 'Q' and l2 != 'J') or (l2 == 'Q' and l1 != 'J'):\n        return False\n    \n    # Guess 7: 34TS\n    if (n1 == '3' and n2 != '4') or (n2 == '3' and n1 != '4') or l1 in 'TS' or l2 in 'TS':\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Filter combinations that satisfy all constraints\nvalid_combinations = [comb for comb in all_combinations if satisfies_constraints(comb)]\n\n# Print the valid combination(s)\nfor combination in valid_combinations:\n    print(f\"<<< {list(combination)} >>>\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically evaluates all possible combinations and applies the constraints from each guess to find the correct password.",
