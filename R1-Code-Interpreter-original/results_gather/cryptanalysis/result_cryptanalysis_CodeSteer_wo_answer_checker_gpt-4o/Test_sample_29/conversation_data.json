    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use the process of elimination to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\n1. **Guess 74JY:**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Either 7 or 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The incorrect number is smaller than the correct number.\n   - Either J or Y is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is earlier in the alphabet than the correct letter.\n\n2. **Guess 93ZN:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - The numbers 9 and 3 are not part of the password.\n   - The letters Z and N are not part of the password.\n\n3. **Guess 26MU:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - The numbers 2 and 6 are not part of the password and the correct numbers are greater than these.\n   - The letters M and U are not part of the password.\n\n4. **Guess 57FS:**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Either 5 or 7 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect number is smaller than the correct number.\n   - Either F or S is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The incorrect letter is earlier in the alphabet than the correct letter.\n\n**Combining the information:**\n- From guesses 1 and 4, we know that 7 is a correct number. In guess 1, it is in the correct position, and in guess 4, it is in the wrong position. Therefore, 7 is the first number.\n- From guess 4, 5 is a correct number but in the wrong position, so it must be the second number.\n- From guess 1, J is correct but in the wrong position, and from guess 4, S is correct and in the correct position. Therefore, S is the second letter.\n- From guess 1, Y is incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so the correct letter must be later than Y. Since J is correct but in the wrong position, it must be the first letter.\n\nThus, the password is 75JS.\n\n```python\n# Final password\npassword = [\"7\", \"5\", \"J\", \"S\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To systematically evaluate all possible combinations of numbers and letters, we can implement a constraint satisfaction approach.
