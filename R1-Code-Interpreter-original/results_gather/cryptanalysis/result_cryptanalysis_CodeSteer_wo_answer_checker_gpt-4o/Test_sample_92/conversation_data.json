    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 14, we know that 5, 8, 1, 9, 7, 0, 2, and 6 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 5 is incorrect, 2 must be correct.\n   - From guess 6, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 7 is incorrect, 2 must be correct.\n   - From guess 10, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 0 is incorrect, 2 must be correct.\n   - From guess 12, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 1 is incorrect, 2 must be correct.\n   - From guess 13, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 9 is incorrect, 2 must be correct.\n   - From guess 16, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 0 is incorrect, 2 must be correct.\n   - From guess 5, one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 8 is incorrect, 6 must be correct.\n   - From guess 9, one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 9 is incorrect, 6 must be correct.\n   - From guess 11, one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 9 is incorrect, 6 must be correct.\n   - From guess 15, one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 0 is incorrect, 6 must be correct.\n\n   Therefore, the numbers are 2 and 6.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, we know that T, D, S, K, U, I, A, C, W, L, P, B, F, X, H, J, O, and G are incorrect.\n   - From guess 16, one letter is correct but in the wrong position. Since V is incorrect and too late in the alphabet, X must be correct.\n\n   Therefore, the letters are M and X.\n\nThe password is deduced to be 26MX.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"2\", \"6\", \"M\", \"X\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more sophisticated approach, we can implement a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver. We'll use backtracking to systematically evaluate the conditions and deduce the correct password. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Define Variables and Domains:**\n   - We have two numbers and two letters. The numbers can be from 0 to 9, and the letters can be from A to Z.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each guess provides constraints on the possible values for the numbers and letters.\n   - We need to ensure that the numbers and letters do not repeat.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm:**\n   - We'll use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of numbers and letters.\n   - For each combination, we'll check if it satisfies all the constraints from the guesses.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the constraints based on the feedback\nconstraints = [\n    (\"58TD\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"52SK\", (1, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"19UI\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"75AC\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"86WD\", (0, 1, 0, 0)),\n    (\"72KL\", (1, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"08LP\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"51PB\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"96FX\", (0, 1, 0, 0)),\n    (\"02HU\", (1, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"96FJ\", (0, 1, 0, 0)),\n    (\"12KC\", (1, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"92TG\", (1, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"98OJ\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"06ML\", (0, 1, 0, 0)),\n    (\"02VX\", (1, 0, 1, 0))\n]\n\n# Possible numbers and letters\nnumbers = \"0123456789\"\nletters = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n# Function to check if a guess satisfies the constraints\ndef satisfies_constraints(guess, feedback):\n    for (test_guess, (num_correct, num_wrong_pos, let_correct, let_wrong_pos)) in constraints:\n        num_correct_count = sum(1 for i in range(2) if guess[i] == test_guess[i])\n        num_wrong_pos_count = sum(1 for i in range(2) if guess[i] in test_guess and guess[i] != test_guess[i])\n        let_correct_count = sum(1 for i in range(2, 4) if guess[i] == test_guess[i])\n        let_wrong_pos_count = sum(1 for i in range(2, 4) if guess[i] in test_guess and guess[i] != test_guess[i])\n        \n        if (num_correct_count != num_correct or num_wrong_pos_count != num_wrong_pos or\n            let_correct_count != let_correct or let_wrong_pos_count != let_wrong_pos):\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try all permutations of two numbers and two letters\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers, 2):\n    for let_perm in permutations(letters, 2):\n        guess = num_perm + let_perm\n        if satisfies_constraints(guess, constraints):\n            print(f\"<<< {list(guess)} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code uses permutations to generate all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters, then checks each combination against the constraints using a backtracking approach. The first combination that satisfies all constraints is printed as the solution."
