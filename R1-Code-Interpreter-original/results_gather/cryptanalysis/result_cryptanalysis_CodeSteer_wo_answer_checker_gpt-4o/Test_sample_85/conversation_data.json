    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, we know that 8, 6, 9, 3, 1, 5, 0, and 7 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is incorrect, 2 must be correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 6, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect. Since 2 is already known to be correct, 3 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 11, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect. Since 4 is incorrect (from guess 13), 7 must be correct and in the correct position.\n\n   Therefore, the numbers are 2 and 7.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12, we know that A, F, L, X, K, T, M, J, V, Q, I, C, O, E, Z, and Q are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect. Since W is incorrect (from guess 13), K is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 13, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. Since D is incorrect, W is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n   Therefore, the letters are K and W.\n\nCombining the numbers and letters, the password is 27KW.\n\n```python\n# Final password\npassword = [\"2\", \"7\", \"K\", \"W\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
