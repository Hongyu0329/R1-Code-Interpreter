    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and apply logical reasoning to eliminate possibilities. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, and 3, we know that one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This suggests that the correct number is greater than 7, 2, and 6.\n   - From guess 4, both numbers are incorrect and too small, so the correct numbers are greater than 4 and 0.\n   - From guess 5, both numbers are incorrect, so the correct numbers are not 4 or 8.\n   - From guess 6, both numbers are incorrect and too small, so the correct numbers are greater than 1 and 5.\n   - From guess 7, both numbers are incorrect, so the correct numbers are not 8 or 3.\n   - From guess 8, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This suggests that 9 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 9, both numbers are incorrect and too small, so the correct numbers are greater than 3 and 2.\n   - From guess 10, both numbers are incorrect and too small, so the correct numbers are greater than 1 and 6.\n   - From guess 11, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect. This suggests that 9 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 12, both numbers are incorrect and too small, so the correct numbers are greater than 3 and 6.\n   - From guess 13, both numbers are incorrect and too small, so the correct numbers are greater than 3 and 5.\n   - From guess 14, both numbers are incorrect and too small, so the correct numbers are greater than 3 and 6.\n\n   From this analysis, the only possible numbers are 9 and 7.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, and 3, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This suggests the correct letters are later than B, Q, and E.\n   - From guess 4, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This suggests that T is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 5, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This suggests the correct letters are later than N and P.\n   - From guess 6, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This suggests the correct letters are later than F and Q.\n   - From guess 7, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This suggests the correct letters are later than P and F.\n   - From guess 8, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This suggests the correct letters are later than M and J.\n   - From guess 9, both letters are incorrect. This suggests the correct letters are not Y or J.\n   - From guess 10, both letters are incorrect. This suggests the correct letters are not S or U.\n   - From guess 11, both letters are incorrect. This suggests the correct letters are not X or J.\n   - From guess 12, both letters are incorrect. This suggests the correct letters are not X or J.\n   - From guess 13, both letters are incorrect. This suggests the correct letters are not Z or U.\n   - From guess 14, both letters are incorrect. This suggests the correct letters are not F or V.\n\n   From this analysis, the only possible letters are W and T.\n\nGiven the above deductions, the password is likely to be 97WT. Let's write the Python code to output this:\n\n```python\npassword = [\"9\", \"7\", \"W\", \"T\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic approach, we can implement a constraint satisfaction algorithm. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of numbers and letters, applying the constraints from each guess to eliminate invalid combinations. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the possible values** for numbers and letters:\n   - Numbers: 0-9\n   - Letters: A-Z\n\n2. **Iterate over all possible combinations** of two numbers and two letters.\n\n3. **Apply constraints** from each guess to filter out invalid combinations:\n   - For each guess, check the feedback and apply the constraints to eliminate combinations that don't satisfy the feedback.\n\n4. **Output the valid combination** that satisfies all constraints.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters\nnumbers = '0123456789'\nletters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n# Feedback from each guess\nfeedback = [\n    ('71BQ', (1, 1, 0, 0)),  # (correct number in wrong position, incorrect number too small, incorrect letters too early)\n    ('29BQ', (1, 1, 0, 0)),\n    ('69BE', (1, 1, 0, 0)),\n    ('40QT', (0, 2, 1, 0)),\n    ('48NP', (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    ('15FQ', (0, 2, 0, 0)),\n    ('83PF', (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    ('96MJ', (1, 1, 0, 0)),\n    ('32YJ', (0, 2, 0, 0)),\n    ('16SU', (0, 2, 0, 0)),\n    ('89XJ', (1, 1, 0, 0)),\n    ('36XJ', (0, 2, 0, 0)),\n    ('35ZU', (0, 2, 0, 0)),\n    ('36FV', (0, 2, 0, 0))\n]\n\n# Function to check if a combination is valid\ndef is_valid_combination(combo, feedback):\n    for guess, (num_correct_wrong_pos, num_incorrect_small, letter_correct_wrong_pos, letter_incorrect_early) in feedback:\n        num_correct = sum(c1 == c2 for c1, c2 in zip(combo[:2], guess[:2]))\n        num_wrong_pos = sum(c in guess[:2] for c in combo[:2]) - num_correct\n        num_small = sum(c < g for c, g in zip(combo[:2], guess[:2]))\n        \n        letter_correct = sum(c1 == c2 for c1, c2 in zip(combo[2:], guess[2:]))\n        letter_wrong_pos = sum(c in guess[2:] for c in combo[2:]) - letter_correct\n        letter_early = sum(c < g for c, g in zip(combo[2:], guess[2:]))\n        \n        if not (num_wrong_pos == num_correct_wrong_pos and num_small == num_incorrect_small and\n                letter_wrong_pos == letter_correct_wrong_pos and letter_early == letter_incorrect_early):\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations\nfor num_combo in permutations(numbers, 2):\n    for letter_combo in permutations(letters, 2):\n        combo = num_combo + letter_combo\n        if is_valid_combination(combo, feedback):\n            print(f\"<<< {list(combo)} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code systematically evaluates all possible combinations of numbers and letters, applying the constraints from each guess to find the correct password."

    "The current solution is based on manual deduction and simple string formatting, which lacks the complexity needed for symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that systematically evaluates all possible combinations of numbers and letters, taking into account the feedback from each guess. This could involve using constraint satisfaction techniques or backtracking algorithms to efficiently narrow down the possibilities and find the correct password."
