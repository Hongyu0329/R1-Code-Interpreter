    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and narrow down the possibilities for each position in the password. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Guess: 03OQ**\n   - Numbers: Both are incorrect and too small.\n   - Letters: Both are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 76EC**\n   - Numbers: Both are incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: Both are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 83FO**\n   - Numbers: Both are incorrect.\n   - Letters: One is correct and in the correct position; one is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 47OF**\n   - Numbers: One is correct and in the correct position; one is incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: One is correct but in the wrong position; one is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 87LK**\n   - Numbers: Both are incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: One is correct and in the correct position; one is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce:\n\n- **Numbers:**\n  - From Guess 1 and 2, the numbers must be between 4 and 6.\n  - From Guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 7 is too large (from Guess 5), the correct number in the first position is 4.\n  - From Guess 4, the second number is incorrect and too large, so it must be smaller than 7. Since 3 is too small (from Guess 1), the second number is 5.\n\n- **Letters:**\n  - From Guess 1 and 2, the letters must be between E and O.\n  - From Guess 3, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since F is incorrect and too late, O is correct and in the third position.\n  - From Guess 4, one letter is correct but in the wrong position. Since O is in the correct position, F is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be in the fourth position.\n  - From Guess 5, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since L is incorrect and too late, K is correct and in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the password is 45OK.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"4\", \"5\", \"O\", \"K\"]\nprint(password)\n```",
    "To implement a more systematic approach, we can use a brute-force method combined with constraint checking. This involves iterating through all possible combinations of numbers and letters, applying the constraints from each guess to filter out invalid combinations. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Define the possible range for numbers and letters:**\n   - Numbers: 0-9\n   - Letters: A-Z\n\n2. **Iterate through all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters.**\n\n3. **Apply the constraints from each guess to filter out invalid combinations:**\n   - For each guess, check if the combination satisfies the feedback conditions.\n   - If a combination satisfies all conditions, it is the correct password.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on constraints\npossible_numbers = [str(i) for i in range(4, 7)]  # Numbers between 4 and 6\npossible_letters = [chr(i) for i in range(ord('E'), ord('O') + 1)]  # Letters between E and O\n\n# All possible combinations of two numbers and two letters\nall_combinations = permutations(possible_numbers, 2) + permutations(possible_letters, 2)\n\n# Function to check if a combination satisfies all conditions\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters):\n    # Check against each guess\n    # Guess 1: 03OQ\n    if not (numbers[0] > '0' and numbers[1] > '3' and letters[0] < 'O' and letters[1] < 'Q'):\n        return False\n    # Guess 2: 76EC\n    if not (numbers[0] < '7' and numbers[1] < '6' and letters[0] > 'E' and letters[1] > 'C'):\n        return False\n    # Guess 3: 83FO\n    if not (letters[0] == 'O' or letters[1] == 'O'):\n        return False\n    # Guess 4: 47OF\n    if not (numbers[0] == '4' or numbers[1] < '7' and letters[0] == 'F' or letters[1] == 'F'):\n        return False\n    # Guess 5: 87LK\n    if not (letters[0] == 'K' or letters[1] == 'K'):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Find the correct combination\nfor num_comb in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for let_comb in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        if is_valid_combination(num_comb, let_comb):\n            password = list(num_comb + let_comb)\n            print(password)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code systematically checks each possible combination of numbers and letters against the constraints provided by the guesses.

This approach would be more scalable and adaptable to variations in the problem.",
