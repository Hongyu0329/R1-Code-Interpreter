    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 1 (87VX), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2 (26AP), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3 (98ZT), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 4 (98HL), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 5 (93BN), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 6 (37CG), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7 (17KW), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (92XC), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 9 (30NX), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 10 (74DJ), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - The correct numbers are 9 and 4. \n   - 9 is in the first position (from guesses 3, 4, 5, and 8).\n   - 4 is in the second position (from guess 10).\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1 (87VX), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 2 (26AP), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3 (98ZT), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 4 (98HL), one letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 5 (93BN), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6 (37CG), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7 (17KW), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 8 (92XC), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9 (30NX), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 10 (74DJ), both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - The correct letters are H and L.\n   - H is in the third position (from guess 4).\n   - L is in the fourth position (from guess 4).\n\nThus, the password is 94HL.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"9\", \"4\", \"H\", \"L\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a constraint satisfaction approach. We'll represent each guess and its feedback as constraints and use a search algorithm to find the combination that satisfies all constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the Problem:**\n   - We have two numbers (X, Y) and two letters (Z, W) to determine.\n   - Each guess provides feedback that can be translated into constraints.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - For each guess, based on the feedback, we will create constraints for numbers and letters.\n   - We will use sets to keep track of possible values for each position.\n\n3. **Search for Solution:**\n   - Iterate over all possible combinations of numbers and letters.\n   - Check each combination against all constraints.\n   - Return the combination that satisfies all constraints.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - Use Python to implement the constraint satisfaction problem.\n   - Use itertools to generate combinations and systematically check each one.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters\nnumbers = '0123456789'\nletters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n# Constraints based on feedback\nconstraints = [\n    lambda x, y, z, w: x not in '87' and y not in '87' and z < 'V' and w < 'X',\n    lambda x, y, z, w: x not in '26' and y not in '26' and z not in 'AP' and w not in 'AP',\n    lambda x, y, z, w: (x == '9' and y not in '8') or (y == '8' and x not in '9') and z > 'Z' and w > 'T',\n    lambda x, y, z, w: (x == '9' and y not in '8') or (y == '8' and x not in '9') and (z == 'H' or w == 'L'),\n    lambda x, y, z, w: (x == '9' and y not in '3') or (y == '3' and x not in '9') and z not in 'BN' and w not in 'BN',\n    lambda x, y, z, w: x not in '37' and y not in '37' and z > 'C' and w > 'G',\n    lambda x, y, z, w: x not in '17' and y not in '17' and z > 'K' and w > 'W',\n    lambda x, y, z, w: (x == '9' and y not in '2') or (y == '2' and x not in '9') and z not in 'XC' and w not in 'XC',\n    lambda x, y, z, w: x not in '30' and y not in '30' and z < 'N' and w < 'X',\n    lambda x, y, z, w: (x == '7' and y not in '4') or (y == '4' and x not in '7') and z not in 'DJ' and w not in 'DJ'\n]\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of numbers and letters\nfor x, y in permutations(numbers, 2):\n    for z, w in permutations(letters, 2):\n        if all(constraint(x, y, z, w) for constraint in constraints):\n            print(f\"<<< ['{x}', '{y}', '{z}', '{w}'] >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code systematically checks each possible combination of numbers and letters against the constraints derived from the feedback. The first combination that satisfies all constraints is printed as the solution."

    "Solve this question with more complex and delicate code. Consider implementing a systematic approach to evaluate each condition and use efficient searching or symbolic computing to deduce the correct password. This will ensure that all constraints are thoroughly checked and the solution is robust."
