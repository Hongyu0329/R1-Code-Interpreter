    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use the process of elimination to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **From Guess 56QS:**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: One of 5 or 6 is correct and in the correct position. Q and S are incorrect and too late.\n\n2. **From Guess 47KB:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 4 and 7 are not in the password. K and B are not in the password.\n\n3. **From Guess 83CN:**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late.\n   - Conclusion: 8 or 3 is correct but in the wrong position. C is correct but in the wrong position. N is incorrect and too late.\n\n4. **From Guess 35JX:**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late.\n   - Conclusion: 3 is incorrect and too small. 5 is correct but in the wrong position. J and X are incorrect and too late.\n\n5. **From Guess 95FG:**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 9 is incorrect and too large. 5 is correct but in the wrong position. F is correct but in the wrong position. G is incorrect.\n\n### Deducing the Password:\n\n- **Numbers:**\n  - From the analysis, 5 is correct but in the wrong position (from guesses 56QS and 95FG).\n  - 8 is correct but in the wrong position (from guess 83CN).\n  - Therefore, the numbers are 8 and 5.\n\n- **Letters:**\n  - C is correct but in the wrong position (from guess 83CN).\n  - F is correct but in the wrong position (from guess 95FG).\n  - Therefore, the letters are C and F.\n\n### Final Password:\n\nThe password is 85CF.\n\n```python\npassword = [\"8\", \"5\", \"C\", \"F\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To implement a more systematic approach, we can use a brute-force algorithm that evaluates all possible combinations of numbers and letters, while applying the constraints from the feedback. This approach will ensure that we find the correct combination by checking each possibility against the given conditions.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1. **Define Possible Values:**\n   - Numbers: 0-9\n   - Letters: A-Z\n\n2. **Apply Constraints:**\n   - Use the feedback from each guess to eliminate impossible combinations.\n\n3. **Brute-force Search:**\n   - Iterate over all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters.\n   - Check each combination against the feedback from the guesses.\n   - Print the combination that satisfies all conditions.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters\nnumbers = '0123456789'\nletters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n# Feedback conditions\ndef check_combination(combo):\n    num1, num2, let1, let2 = combo\n\n    # Guess 56QS\n    if not ((num1 == '5' or num2 == '5') and (num1 != '6' and num2 != '6') and let1 < 'Q' and let2 < 'S'):\n        return False\n\n    # Guess 47KB\n    if num1 in '47' or num2 in '47' or let1 in 'KB' or let2 in 'KB':\n        return False\n\n    # Guess 83CN\n    if not ((num1 == '8' or num2 == '8') and (num1 != '3' and num2 != '3') and (let1 == 'C' or let2 == 'C') and let1 < 'N' and let2 < 'N'):\n        return False\n\n    # Guess 35JX\n    if not ((num1 == '5' or num2 == '5') and (num1 != '3' and num2 != '3') and let1 < 'J' and let2 < 'X'):\n        return False\n\n    # Guess 95FG\n    if not ((num1 == '5' or num2 == '5') and (num1 != '9' and num2 != '9') and (let1 == 'F' or let2 == 'F') and let1 != 'G' and let2 != 'G'):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Generate all permutations of two numbers and two letters\nfor num_combo in permutations(numbers, 2):\n    for let_combo in permutations(letters, 2):\n        combo = num_combo + let_combo\n        if check_combination(combo):\n            print(f\"<<< {list(combo)} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code systematically evaluates all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters, applying the constraints from the feedback to find the correct password."

    "The current solution seems to be correct based on the analysis of the feedback from each guess. However, the code provided is quite simple and does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically evaluates all possible combinations of numbers and letters, taking into account the constraints provided by the feedback. This approach will ensure that the solution is robust and can handle more complex scenarios."
