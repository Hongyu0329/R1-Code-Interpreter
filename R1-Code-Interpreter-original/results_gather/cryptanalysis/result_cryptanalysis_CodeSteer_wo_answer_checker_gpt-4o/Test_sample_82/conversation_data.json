    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Guess: 87CF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large: Possible numbers are 0-6.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early: Possible letters are G-Z.\n\n2. **Guess: 71SM**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: Possible numbers are 0-6, and one of them is 1 or 7.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large: Possible numbers are 0-6, excluding 7.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: Possible letters are G-Z, and one of them is S or M.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late: Possible letters are G-R.\n\n3. **Guess: 23AY**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Possible numbers are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Possible letters are G-R, excluding A and Y.\n\n4. **Guess: 53PD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Possible numbers are 0, 1, 4, 6.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: Possible letters are G-R, and one of them is P or D.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early: Possible letters are Q-R.\n\n5. **Guess: 01UF**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: Possible numbers are 0, 1, 4, 6, and one of them is 0 or 1.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small: Possible numbers are 4, 6.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Possible letters are Q-R, excluding U and F.\n\n6. **Guess: 43US**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Possible numbers are 0, 1, 6.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late: Possible letters are Q.\n\nFrom the above deductions, the possible numbers are 0 and 6, and the possible letters are Q and P. The correct password is 60PQ.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"6\", \"0\", \"P\", \"Q\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more robust solution, we can implement a program that iterates over all possible combinations of numbers and letters, checking each combination against the given conditions. This approach will ensure that the solution is derived programmatically and can be adapted to similar problems in the future.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Define the possible range for numbers and letters based on the feedback from each guess.\n2. Iterate over all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters.\n3. For each combination, check it against all the conditions provided.\n4. If a combination satisfies all conditions, it is the correct password.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the feedback\npossible_numbers = ['0', '1', '4', '6']\npossible_letters = ['P', 'Q']\n\n# All possible permutations of two numbers and two letters\nnumber_permutations = permutations(possible_numbers, 2)\nletter_permutations = permutations(possible_letters, 2)\n\n# Function to check if a combination satisfies all conditions\ndef check_combination(numbers, letters):\n    # Convert to strings for easier comparison\n    num_str = ''.join(numbers)\n    let_str = ''.join(letters)\n    \n    # Check each condition\n    # Condition 1: 87CF\n    if num_str[0] in '87' or num_str[1] in '87' or let_str[0] in 'CF' or let_str[1] in 'CF':\n        return False\n    # Condition 2: 71SM\n    if (num_str[0] == '1' and num_str[1] != '7') or (num_str[1] == '1' and num_str[0] != '7'):\n        return False\n    if let_str[0] == 'S' or let_str[1] == 'M':\n        return False\n    # Condition 3: 23AY\n    if num_str[0] in '23' or num_str[1] in '23' or let_str[0] in 'AY' or let_str[1] in 'AY':\n        return False\n    # Condition 4: 53PD\n    if num_str[0] in '53' or num_str[1] in '53':\n        return False\n    if (let_str[0] == 'P' and let_str[1] != 'D') or (let_str[1] == 'P' and let_str[0] != 'D'):\n        return False\n    # Condition 5: 01UF\n    if (num_str[0] == '0' and num_str[1] != '1') or (num_str[1] == '0' and num_str[0] != '1'):\n        return False\n    if let_str[0] in 'UF' or let_str[1] in 'UF':\n        return False\n    # Condition 6: 43US\n    if num_str[0] in '43' or num_str[1] in '43' or let_str[0] in 'US' or let_str[1] in 'US':\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations\nfor numbers in number_permutations:\n    for letters in letter_permutations:\n        if check_combination(numbers, letters):\n            password = list(numbers) + list(letters)\n            print(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all possible combinations of numbers and letters, checking each one against the conditions provided. When it finds a combination that satisfies all conditions, it will print the password."

    "The current solution seems to have deduced the password correctly through logical reasoning. However, the code provided is simply displaying the answer without any computation or verification. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that programmatically verifies each condition and deduces the password step by step. This could involve iterating over possible combinations and checking them against the given conditions to ensure the solution is robust and adaptable to similar problems."
