    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use the process of elimination to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **From Guess 35PQ:**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 3 or 5 is correct and in the correct position. The other number is too large, so it must be 5 (since 3 is smaller than 5). Both letters P and Q are too late, so they are not in the password.\n\n2. **From Guess 24XE:**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Since 5 is too large, the correct number from the first position must be 3. The number 4 is too small, so the correct number in the second position must be 5. The letter X is correct and in the correct position. The letter E is too late, so it is not in the password.\n\n3. **From Guess 96SQ:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Confirms that numbers 9 and 6 are too large, supporting that 3 and 5 are correct. Letters S and Q are too late, confirming that X is correct and the other letter must be earlier in the alphabet.\n\n4. **From Guess 25XC:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Confirms that 2 and 5 are incorrect, supporting that 3 is correct. The letter X is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be the second letter. The letter C is too late, so it is not in the password.\n\n### Final Deduction:\n- Numbers: 3 and 1 (since 1 is the only number left that fits the criteria).\n- Letters: X and A (since A is the only letter earlier than C that fits the criteria).\n\nThe password is [3, 1, 'A', 'X'].\n\n```python\n# Final password deduction\npassword = [3, 1, 'A', 'X']\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic approach, we can implement a backtracking algorithm. This algorithm will explore all possible combinations of numbers and letters, checking each combination against the given conditions.
