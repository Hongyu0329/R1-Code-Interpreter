    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. From Guess 1 (79EQ), we know:\n   - Both numbers (7, 9) are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (E, Q) are incorrect.\n\n2. From Guess 2 (37TK), we know:\n   - Both numbers (3, 7) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (T, K) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. From Guess 3 (25EO), we know:\n   - Both numbers (2, 5) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (E, O) are incorrect.\n\n4. From Guess 4 (86LZ), we know:\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 8 and 6 are both larger than 5, the correct number must be 6.\n   - Both letters (L, Z) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. From Guess 5 (43WQ), we know:\n   - Both numbers (4, 3) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (W, Q) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n6. From Guess 6 (31AO), we know:\n   - Both numbers (3, 1) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (A) is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter (O) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n7. From Guess 7 (89GW), we know:\n   - Both numbers (8, 9) are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter (G) is correct and in the correct position, and one letter (W) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the above deductions:\n- The numbers must be 0 and 6, as they are the only numbers not eliminated and 6 is confirmed from Guess 4.\n- The letters must be A and G, with G in the correct position from Guess 7 and A in the wrong position from Guess 6.\n\nThus, the password is 06AG.\n\n```python\n# Final password\npassword = [\"0\", \"6\", \"A\", \"G\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more robust solution, we can implement a systematic search algorithm that evaluates each condition and narrows down possibilities. We'll use a function to iterate through potential combinations of numbers and letters, checking each against the given conditions.
