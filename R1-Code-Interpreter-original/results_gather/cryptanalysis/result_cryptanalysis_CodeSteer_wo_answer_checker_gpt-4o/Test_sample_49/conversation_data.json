    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use logical reasoning to determine the correct numbers and letters. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Guess: 75KB**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 15UA**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n3. **Guess: 09KJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 05PB**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 69DB**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 54ZF**\n   - Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From guess 6, we know the numbers are 5 and 4 in the correct positions.\n- From guess 2, since 1 is incorrect and too small, and 5 is correct but in the wrong position, the correct number in the first position is 4.\n- From guess 4, since 0 is incorrect and too small, and 5 is correct but in the wrong position, the correct number in the second position is 5.\n- From guess 2, both letters U and A are correct and in the correct positions.\n\nThus, the password is 45UA.\n\n```python\n# Final password\npassword = [\"4\", \"5\", \"U\", \"A\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To implement a more complex algorithm that systematically evaluates each guess and feedback, we can use a constraint satisfaction approach. This involves iterating through possible combinations of numbers and letters, checking them against the feedback, and narrowing down the possibilities using logical deductions. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Define the possible values** for numbers and letters based on the feedback.\n2. **Iterate through all possible combinations** of numbers and letters.\n3. **Check each combination** against the feedback from each guess.\n4. **Narrow down the possibilities** by eliminating combinations that do not satisfy the feedback conditions.\n5. **Output the correct combination** once found.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define possible numbers and letters\npossible_numbers = ['0', '1', '4', '5']\npossible_letters = ['U', 'A']\n\n# Function to check if a combination satisfies the feedback\ndef satisfies_feedback(combo, guess, feedback):\n    num_correct = 0\n    num_wrong_position = 0\n    num_too_large = 0\n    num_too_small = 0\n    letter_correct = 0\n    letter_wrong = 0\n\n    # Check numbers\n    for i in range(2):\n        if combo[i] == guess[i]:\n            num_correct += 1\n        elif combo[i] in guess[:2]:\n            num_wrong_position += 1\n        elif combo[i] > guess[i]:\n            num_too_large += 1\n        else:\n            num_too_small += 1\n\n    # Check letters\n    for i in range(2, 4):\n        if combo[i] == guess[i]:\n            letter_correct += 1\n        else:\n            letter_wrong += 1\n\n    # Compare with feedback\n    if feedback == (num_correct, num_wrong_position, num_too_large, num_too_small, letter_correct, letter_wrong):\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Define feedback for each guess\nfeedbacks = [\n    (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2),  # 75KB\n    (0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0),  # 15UA\n    (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2),  # 09KJ\n    (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2),  # 05PB\n    (0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2),  # 69DB\n    (2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2)   # 54ZF\n]\n\n# Iterate through all possible combinations\nfor num_combo in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for letter_combo in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        combo = num_combo + letter_combo\n        if all(satisfies_feedback(combo, guess, feedback) for guess, feedback in zip(['75KB', '15UA', '09KJ', '05PB', '69DB', '54ZF'], feedbacks)):\n            print(f\"<<< {list(combo)} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code uses permutations to generate all possible combinations of numbers and letters, then checks each combination against the feedback from each guess. The `satisfies_feedback` function ensures that each combination meets the conditions specified by the feedback. Once a valid combination is found, it is printed as the correct password."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code is overly simplistic and does not demonstrate the use of symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically evaluates each guess and feedback to deduce the password. This could involve creating a function that iterates through possible combinations, checks them against the feedback, and narrows down the possibilities using logical deductions. This approach will better showcase the use of symbolic computing and efficient searching."
