    "To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 09OW**\n   - Both numbers (0 and 9) are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - Both letters (O and W) are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 71BK**\n   - Both numbers (7 and 1) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (B and K) are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 40TV**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters (T and V) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Since 0 is correct from the first guess, 4 must be incorrect, and 0 is in the wrong position.\n\n4. **Guess: 92SU**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect.\n   - One letter (S) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter (U) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Since 9 is correct from the first guess, 2 must be incorrect, and 9 is in the wrong position.\n\n5. **Guess: 41SD**\n   - Both numbers (4 and 1) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (S and D) are correct and in the correct positions.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- The correct numbers are 0 and 9, with 9 in the first position and 0 in the second position.\n- The correct letters are S and D, with S in the third position and D in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct password is 90SD.\n\n```python\n# Output the deduced password\npassword = [\"9\", \"0\", \"S\", \"D\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```"
