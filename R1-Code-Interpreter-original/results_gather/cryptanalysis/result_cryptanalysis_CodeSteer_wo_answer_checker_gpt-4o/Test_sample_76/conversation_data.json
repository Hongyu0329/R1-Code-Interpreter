    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 1, both numbers 0 and 5 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and 8 is too small. So, 8 is incorrect, and the correct number is either 0 or 2.\n   - From guess 3, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and 6 is incorrect. So, the correct number is either 1 or 2.\n   - From guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and 3 is incorrect. So, the correct number is 8.\n   - From guess 5, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and 4 is incorrect. So, the correct number is 1.\n   - From guess 6, both numbers 3 and 9 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and 5 is incorrect. So, the correct number is 1.\n   - From guess 8, one number is correct and in the correct position, and 3 is incorrect. So, the correct number is 1.\n   - From guess 9, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and 8 is incorrect. So, the correct number is 3.\n   - From guess 10, both numbers 5 and 4 are incorrect.\n\n   From the above deductions, the numbers are 1 and 8.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1, both letters X and U are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2, both letters U and C are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, both letters H and P are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, both letters J and O are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, both letters T and O are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and F is incorrect. So, P is correct.\n   - From guess 7, both letters K and R are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, both letters B and E are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 9, both letters A and Z are incorrect.\n   - From guess 10, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and V is incorrect. So, L is correct.\n\n   From the above deductions, the letters are P and L.\n\nCombining the numbers and letters, the password is [1, 8, 'P', 'L'].\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [1, 8, 'P', 'L']\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic approach, we can employ a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) approach.
