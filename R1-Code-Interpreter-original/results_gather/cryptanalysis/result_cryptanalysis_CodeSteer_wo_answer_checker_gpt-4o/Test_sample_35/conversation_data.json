    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and apply logical reasoning to determine the correct combination of numbers and letters.\n\n1. From the first guess \"14LZ\":\n   - Both numbers (1 and 4) are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters (L and Z) are incorrect.\n\n2. From the second guess \"28EP\":\n   - Both numbers (2 and 8) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (E or P) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet, meaning it should be a letter that comes later than the incorrect one.\n\n3. From the third guess \"14RW\":\n   - Both numbers (1 and 4) are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters (R and W) are incorrect.\n\n4. From the fourth guess \"70XH\":\n   - Both numbers (7 and 0) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (X or H) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- The correct numbers are 1 and 4, but they need to be swapped from their positions in the guesses.\n- The correct letter from the second guess is either E or P, and from the fourth guess is either X or H.\n- Since E is too early in the alphabet, P is the correct letter from the second guess.\n- Since X is too early in the alphabet, H is the correct letter from the fourth guess.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 41PH.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the result:\n\n```python\n# The correct password based on the deductions\npassword = [\"4\", \"1\", \"P\", \"H\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```"
