    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and its feedback to narrow down the possibilities for the numbers and letters. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Guess: 35WJ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 67VX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 37QK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 75GT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 34QE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 27CU**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 56FA**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n8. **Guess: 84YT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From guess 2, numbers 6 and 7 are incorrect.\n- From guess 6, number 2 is incorrect.\n- From guess 5, numbers 3 and 4 are too small.\n- From guess 8, number 8 is correct and in the correct position, and number 4 is too small.\n- From guess 1, number 5 is incorrect and too small.\n- From guess 4, number 7 is incorrect.\n- From guess 7, number 5 is incorrect.\n\nThus, the only possible numbers are 8 and 9. Since 8 is in the correct position in guess 8, the numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n- From guess 1, letters W and J are incorrect.\n- From guess 2, letters V and X are incorrect.\n- From guess 3, letter Q is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, letters G and T are incorrect.\n- From guess 5, letters Q and E are incorrect.\n- From guess 6, letters C and U are incorrect.\n- From guess 7, letters F and A are incorrect.\n- From guess 8, letter Y is correct and in the correct position, and letter T is incorrect.\n\nThus, the letters are Q and Y, with Q in the first letter position and Y in the second.\n\nThe password is 89QY.\n\n```python\npassword = [\"8\", \"9\", \"Q\", \"Y\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
