    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from each guess. Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 6, we know that both numbers 7 and 6 are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - From guess 1, we know that 7 is in the correct position.\n   - From guess 10, we know that 6 is in the correct position.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 6, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect.\n   - From guess 12, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 11, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nGiven these deductions, we can conclude:\n- The numbers are 7 and 6.\n- The correct letter from guess 6 is either K or R, but since R is in the correct position in guess 12, R is the correct letter in the second position.\n- The correct letter from guess 12 is F, as it is in the correct position.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 7, 6, F, R.\n\n```python\n# The correct password based on the deductions\npassword = [\"7\", \"6\", \"F\", \"R\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more systematically, we can use a constraint satisfaction approach. We'll iterate through all possible combinations of numbers and letters, applying the feedback rules to filter out incorrect guesses. This approach will ensure that we consider all constraints and find the correct combination.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Define the possible numbers and letters**: Since the numbers and letters do not repeat, we need to consider all possible digits (0-9) and letters (A-Z).\n\n2. **Iterate through all possible combinations**: We'll generate all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters.\n\n3. **Apply the feedback rules**: For each combination, we'll check it against all the given conditions. If a combination satisfies all conditions, it's the correct password.\n\n4. **Output the correct combination**: Once we find a combination that satisfies all conditions, we'll print it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define possible numbers and letters\npossible_numbers = '0123456789'\npossible_letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n# Feedback conditions\nconditions = [\n    (\"71HT\", (1, 1, 0, 0)),\n    (\"19ZS\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"48PA\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"49FO\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"25IP\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"76KR\", (2, 0, 1, 0)),\n    (\"17BY\", (0, 1, 0, 0)),\n    (\"31ZP\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"02NE\", (0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    (\"36ZF\", (1, 1, 0, 0)),\n    (\"26SR\", (1, 1, 1, 0)),\n    (\"65FG\", (0, 1, 1, 0))\n]\n\n# Function to check if a guess satisfies the feedback\ndef satisfies_conditions(guess, feedback):\n    num_correct_pos = sum(guess[i] == feedback[i] for i in range(4))\n    num_correct = sum(guess[i] in feedback for i in range(4)) - num_correct_pos\n    return (num_correct_pos, num_correct)\n\n# Iterate through all possible combinations\nfor num1, num2 in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for let1, let2 in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        guess = num1 + num2 + let1 + let2\n        if all(satisfies_conditions(guess, cond[0]) == cond[1] for cond in conditions):\n            print(f\"<<< [{num1}, {num2}, {let1}, {let2}] >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code systematically checks each possible combination of numbers and letters against the given conditions. When it finds a combination that satisfies all conditions, it prints the result."

    "The current solution lacks the complexity needed to effectively deduce the password based on the given conditions. Consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that involves iterating through possible combinations of numbers and letters, applying the feedback rules to filter out incorrect guesses. This could involve using a backtracking algorithm or constraint satisfaction techniques to systematically explore and validate potential solutions. Aim to incorporate symbolic computing or efficient searching methods to enhance the code's ability to solve the problem accurately."
