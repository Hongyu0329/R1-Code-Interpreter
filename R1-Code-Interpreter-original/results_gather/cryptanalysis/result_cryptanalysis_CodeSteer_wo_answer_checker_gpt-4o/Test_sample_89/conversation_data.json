    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use logical reasoning to determine the correct numbers and letters. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Guess: 16TE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 72QY**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 23AX**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 71KQ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 91TW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 51PL**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From guess 1, numbers 1 and 6, and letters T and E are incorrect.\n- From guess 5, numbers 9 and 1, and letters T and W are incorrect.\n- From guess 6, numbers 5 and 1, and letter P is incorrect, L is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n**Numbers:**\n- From guess 2, 7 is correct and in the correct position, 2 is incorrect and too small.\n- From guess 3, 3 is correct and in the correct position, 2 is incorrect and too small.\n- From guess 4, 7 is correct and in the correct position, 1 is incorrect and too small.\n\nThus, the correct numbers are 7 and 3.\n\n**Letters:**\n- From guess 2, Q is correct but in the wrong position, Y is incorrect.\n- From guess 4, K and Q are incorrect.\n- From guess 6, L is correct but in the wrong position, P is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct letters are L and Q, with L in the second position and Q in the first position.\n\nThe password is 73QL.\n\n```python\n# Final password\npassword = [\"7\", \"3\", \"Q\", \"L\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To implement a systematic approach using Python, we can create a function that iterates through all possible combinations of numbers and letters, checking each combination against the feedback conditions. This approach will ensure that we find the correct combination by exhaustively searching through the possibilities.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Define the possible numbers (0-9) and letters (A-Z).\n2. Iterate through all combinations of two distinct numbers and two distinct letters.\n3. For each combination, check it against the feedback from each guess.\n4. If a combination satisfies all feedback conditions, it is the correct password.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters, combination):\n    num1, num2, let1, let2 = combination\n    \n    # Feedback conditions\n    conditions = [\n        # Guess: 16TE\n        (num1 not in [1, 6] and num2 not in [1, 6] and let1 not in ['T', 'E'] and let2 not in ['T', 'E']),\n        # Guess: 72QY\n        (num1 == 7 and num2 > 2 and let1 != 'Q' and let2 == 'Q'),\n        # Guess: 23AX\n        (num1 == 3 and num2 > 2 and let1 not in ['A', 'X'] and let2 not in ['A', 'X']),\n        # Guess: 71KQ\n        (num1 == 7 and num2 > 1 and let1 not in ['K', 'Q'] and let2 not in ['K', 'Q']),\n        # Guess: 91TW\n        (num1 not in [9, 1] and num2 not in [9, 1] and let1 not in ['T', 'W'] and let2 not in ['T', 'W']),\n        # Guess: 51PL\n        (num1 not in [5, 1] and num2 not in [5, 1] and let1 == 'L' and let2 != 'P')\n    ]\n    \n    return all(conditions)\n\ndef find_password():\n    numbers = range(10)\n    letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    \n    for num_comb in permutations(numbers, 2):\n        for let_comb in permutations(letters, 2):\n            combination = (*num_comb, *let_comb)\n            if is_valid_combination(numbers, letters, combination):\n                return combination\n\npassword = find_password()\nprint(f\"<<< {list(map(str, password))} >>>\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically checks each possible combination of two numbers and two letters against the feedback conditions. When it finds a combination that satisfies all conditions, it returns that combination as the password.",
    "To address the issue and ensure the function returns a valid combination, we need to carefully implement the feedback conditions for each guess. Let's add detailed debugging output to trace the logic and adjust the conditions to accurately reflect the feedback.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid_combination(combination):\n    num1, num2, let1, let2 = combination\n    \n    # Feedback conditions\n    conditions = [\n        # Guess: 16TE\n        (num1 not in [1, 6] and num2 not in [1, 6] and let1 not in ['T', 'E'] and let2 not in ['T', 'E']),\n        # Guess: 72QY\n        (num1 == 7 and num2 > 2 and ((let1 == 'Q' and let2 != 'Y') or (let1 != 'Q' and let2 == 'Q'))),\n        # Guess: 23AX\n        (num1 == 3 and num2 > 2 and let1 not in ['A', 'X'] and let2 not in ['A', 'X']),\n        # Guess: 71KQ\n        (num1 == 7 and num2 > 1 and let1 not in ['K', 'Q'] and let2 not in ['K', 'Q']),\n        # Guess: 91TW\n        (num1 not in [9, 1] and num2 not in [9, 1] and let1 not in ['T', 'W'] and let2 not in ['T', 'W']),\n        # Guess: 51PL\n        (num1 not in [5, 1] and num2 not in [5, 1] and ((let1 == 'L' and let2 != 'P') or (let1 != 'P' and let2 == 'L')))\n    ]\n    \n    return all(conditions)\n\ndef find_password():\n    numbers = range(10)\n    letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    \n    for num_comb in permutations(numbers, 2):\n        for let_comb in permutations(letters, 2):\n            combination = (*num_comb, *let_comb)\n            if is_valid_combination(combination):\n                print(f\"Valid combination found: {combination}\")\n                return combination\n\n    print(\"No valid combination found.\")\n    return None\n\npassword = find_password()\nif password:\n    print(f\"<<< {list(map(str, password))} >>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to find a valid password.\")\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- **Feedback Conditions:** Adjusted the conditions to accurately reflect the feedback from each guess. For example, in guess 2, the condition now checks if one of the letters is 'Q' and in the wrong position.\n- **Debugging Output:** Added print statements to output valid combinations when found and a message if no valid combination is found.\n- **Return Statement:** Ensured the function returns a valid combination or `None` if no valid combination is found.\n\nThis code should now correctly find and return the valid password combination based on the feedback conditions.",

    "The current solution is based on logical reasoning and deduction from the given feedback, which is appropriate for this task.

    "The current code attempts to solve the problem using a systematic search approach, which is a step in the right direction. However, there is an error because the function `find_password()` does not return a valid combination, leading to a `NoneType` error. To improve the code, ensure that the feedback conditions are correctly implemented and that the function returns a valid combination. Additionally, consider adding more detailed debugging output to trace where the logic might be failing. This will help identify why no valid combination is being found. Adjust the conditions in `is_valid_combination` to accurately reflect the feedback from each guess.",
