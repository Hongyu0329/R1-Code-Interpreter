    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10, we know that 7, 2, 5, 4, 9, 0, 6, 3, and 8 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11, we know that 1 and 8 are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10, we know that F, Y, K, S, Q, B, U, I, R, L, N, M, and W are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, we know that E is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 8, we know that D is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nBased on this analysis, the numbers are 1 and 8, and the letters are D and E. The correct password is 18DE.\n\n```python\n# The correct password based on the deductions\npassword = [\"1\", \"8\", \"D\", \"E\"]\nprint(password)\n```",
