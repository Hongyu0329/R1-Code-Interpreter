    "To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 97EJ**\n   - Both numbers (9 and 7) are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 43OM**\n   - Both numbers (4 and 3) are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (O and M) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 20BQ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The numbers must be less than 4, as all numbers in the guesses are too large.\n- From the third guess, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect and too large. This means one of the numbers is 0 or 2, but not in the correct position.\n- The letters must be earlier in the alphabet than B, O, M, and Q.\n- From the first guess, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. From the third guess, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. This means one of the letters is E or J, and the other is B or Q.\n\nLet's deduce the correct password step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - Possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3 (since all numbers in the guesses are too large).\n   - From the third guess, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect and too large. This means one of the numbers is 0 or 2, but not in the correct position.\n   - Since 2 is in the wrong position in the third guess, it must be the first number.\n   - The second number must be 0 or 1. Since 0 is in the wrong position in the third guess, it must be the second number.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - Possible letters are A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N (since all letters in the guesses are too late in the alphabet).\n   - From the first guess, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. From the third guess, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. This means one of the letters is E or J, and the other is B or Q.\n   - Since B and Q are too late in the alphabet, the correct letters must be E and J.\n   - From the first guess, E is in the wrong position, so it must be the second letter.\n   - J must be the first letter.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n```python\npassword = [\"2\", \"0\", \"J\", \"E\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can use a systematic approach to iterate through all possible combinations of numbers and letters, applying the constraints from the feedback to narrow down the possibilities. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Numbers and Letters:**\n   - Numbers: Since all numbers in the guesses are too large, the possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n   - Letters: Since all letters in the second guess are too late in the alphabet, the possible letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and N.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Combinations:**\n   - Generate all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters from the identified possibilities.\n   - For each combination, check against the feedback from each guess.\n\n3. **Apply Feedback Constraints:**\n   - For each guess, apply the constraints:\n     - Numbers must be less than those in the guess if they are too large.\n     - Letters must be earlier in the alphabet if they are too late.\n     - Check for correct numbers and letters in the wrong positions.\n\n4. **Output the Correct Combination:**\n   - Once a combination satisfies all constraints, output it as the solution.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on feedback\npossible_numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3']\npossible_letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'N']\n\n# Function to check if a combination satisfies all conditions\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters):\n    # Check against first guess: 97EJ\n    if numbers[0] >= '9' or numbers[1] >= '7':\n        return False\n    if letters[0] == 'E' or letters[1] == 'J':\n        return False\n    if 'E' not in letters and 'J' not in letters:\n        return False\n\n    # Check against second guess: 43OM\n    if numbers[0] >= '4' or numbers[1] >= '3':\n        return False\n    if letters[0] >= 'O' or letters[1] >= 'M':\n        return False\n\n    # Check against third guess: 20BQ\n    if numbers[0] == '2' and numbers[1] == '0':\n        return False\n    if 'B' in letters or 'Q' in letters:\n        return False\n    if 'E' not in letters and 'J' not in letters:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Iterate through all permutations of two numbers and two letters\nfor num_perm in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for let_perm in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        if is_valid_combination(num_perm, let_perm):\n            password = list(num_perm + let_perm)\n            print(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through all possible combinations of numbers and letters, applying the constraints from the feedback to find the correct password."

    "The current solution lacks the necessary complexity to effectively solve the problem using symbolic computing or efficient searching. Consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that involves iterating through possible combinations of numbers and letters, checking each against the given conditions. Use logical deductions and constraints to narrow down the possibilities, ensuring that the solution adheres to all feedback provided. This will help in generating a more accurate and reliable solution."
