    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 14: All numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 9: One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 10, 11, 13, 15: Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 16: One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too small.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - The numbers 5, 7, 4, 0, 9, 8, 2 are incorrect.\n   - The number 6 is correct and in the correct position (from guess 9 and 16).\n   - The number 3 is correct but in the wrong position (from guess 6).\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15: All letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3: Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 16: One letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - The letters U, Y, S, V, Z, D, R, F, Q, O, W, K, H, M, T, E, L are incorrect.\n   - The letter G is correct but in the wrong position (from guess 16).\n   - The letter B is correct and in the correct position (from guess 6).\n\nNow, let's deduce the password:\n\n- The correct numbers are 6 and 3.\n- The correct letters are B and G.\n\nThe password is 63BG.\n\n```python\n# Output the deduced password\npassword = [\"6\", \"3\", \"B\", \"G\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a constraint satisfaction approach. We'll represent each guess and its feedback as constraints and iteratively filter out possibilities for the numbers and letters. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize Possible Values:**\n   - Create sets for possible numbers (0-9) and letters (A-Z).\n\n2. **Apply Constraints from Each Guess:**\n   - For each guess, update the possible values based on the feedback.\n   - Use set operations to eliminate impossible numbers and letters.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Constraints:**\n   - For each guess, apply the feedback to narrow down the possibilities.\n   - Use the feedback to adjust the sets of possible numbers and letters.\n\n4. **Determine the Correct Combination:**\n   - After processing all guesses, the sets should contain only the correct numbers and letters.\n   - Ensure the correct positions are identified based on the feedback.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - Print the deduced password in the required format.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\n# Initialize possible values\npossible_numbers = set(range(10))\npossible_letters = set(\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\")\n\n# Define the feedback for each guess\nguesses = [\n    (\"57UY\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"40SV\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"01ZD\", \"both numbers are incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"58RV\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"90FV\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"38BY\", \"one number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"47QO\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"94WK\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"68HM\", \"one number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"87HB\", \"both numbers are incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"97SH\", \"both numbers are incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"29TE\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"18HS\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"92LU\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"87FM\", \"both numbers are incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"61VG\", \"one number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too small; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\")\n]\n\n# Process each guess\nfor guess, feedback in guesses:\n    numbers = set(int(guess[i]) for i in range(2))\n    letters = set(guess[i] for i in range(2, 4))\n    \n    if \"both numbers are incorrect\" in feedback:\n        possible_numbers -= numbers\n    if \"both letters are incorrect\" in feedback:\n        possible_letters -= letters\n    if \"one number is correct but in the wrong position\" in feedback:\n        possible_numbers &= numbers\n    if \"one number is correct and in the correct position\" in feedback:\n        possible_numbers &= numbers\n    if \"one letter is correct but in the wrong position\" in feedback:\n        possible_letters &= letters\n\n# Deduce the correct numbers and letters\ncorrect_numbers = list(possible_numbers)\ncorrect_letters = list(possible_letters)\n\n# Output the deduced password\npassword = [str(correct_numbers[0]), str(correct_numbers[1]), correct_letters[0], correct_letters[1]]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically applies constraints from each guess to narrow down the possible numbers and letters, ensuring that all conditions are met accurately.",
