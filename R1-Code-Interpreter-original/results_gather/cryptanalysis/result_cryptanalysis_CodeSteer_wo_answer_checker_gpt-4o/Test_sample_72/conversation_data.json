    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 2, numbers 9 and 8 are too large.\n   - From guess 5, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too large. This means 7 or 8 is correct, but since 8 is too large, 7 is correct.\n   - From guess 9, one number is correct and in the correct position, confirming 7 is correct.\n   - From guess 5, the other number is incorrect and too large, so it must be less than 7.\n   - From guess 6, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and since 5 is incorrect, 0 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - Therefore, the numbers are 0 and 7.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 10, both letters V and W are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - From guess 1, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since W is correct in guess 10, K is incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, confirming W is correct.\n   - From guess 2, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so D and R are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so A and O are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so G and A are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so L and I are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so K and A are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so Q and B are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, both letters are incorrect, confirming A and Y are incorrect.\n\nBased on the above deductions, the correct password is:\n\n- Numbers: 0 and 7\n- Letters: V and W\n\nThe final password is 07VW.\n\n```python\n# Final password\npassword = [\"0\", \"7\", \"V\", \"W\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```"
