    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **From Guess 91SF:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect, so 9 and 1 are not in the password.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. Since S is in the same position as C in Guess 75CP, and C is correct but in the wrong position, S must be the correct letter in the correct position. Therefore, F is incorrect.\n\n2. **From Guess 03HF:**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is smaller than 3, and 3 is in the same position as 1 in Guess 91SF (which is incorrect), 0 must be the correct number in the correct position.\n   - Both letters are incorrect, so H and F are not in the password.\n\n3. **From Guess 75CP:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect, so 7 and 5 are not in the password.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. Since C is correct but in the wrong position, and P is incorrect, C must be the correct letter.\n\n4. **From Guess 64YB:**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and incorrect. Since 6 is in the same position as 0 in Guess 03HF (which is correct), 4 must be incorrect, and 6 is the correct number in the correct position.\n   - Both letters are incorrect, so Y and B are not in the password.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The numbers are 0 and 6, with 0 in the first position and 6 in the second position.\n- The letters are S and C, with S in the third position and C in the fourth position.\n\nThe password is 06SC.\n\n```python\n# Final password\npassword = [\"0\", \"6\", \"S\", \"C\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To implement a more complex algorithm that systematically evaluates all possible combinations, we can use a backtracking approach. This involves iterating through potential combinations of numbers and letters, applying the feedback from each guess to eliminate invalid combinations, and ultimately arriving at the correct password.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Define the possible numbers and letters**: Since the numbers and letters do not repeat, we have a limited set to choose from.\n2. **Iterate through all possible combinations**: Use nested loops to generate combinations of two numbers and two letters.\n3. **Apply feedback rules**: For each combination, check it against the feedback from each guess. If a combination violates any feedback, discard it.\n4. **Identify the correct combination**: The combination that satisfies all feedback conditions is the correct password.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters\nnumbers = '0123456789'\nletters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n# Feedback conditions\nfeedback = [\n    ('91SF', (0, 1)),  # Both numbers incorrect, one letter correct and in position\n    ('03HF', (1, 0)),  # One number correct and in position, one number too small\n    ('75CP', (0, 1)),  # Both numbers incorrect, one letter correct but wrong position\n    ('64YB', (1, 0))   # One number correct and in position, one number incorrect\n]\n\ndef is_valid_combination(num1, num2, let1, let2):\n    # Check against each feedback\n    for guess, (num_feedback, let_feedback) in feedback:\n        guess_nums = guess[:2]\n        guess_lets = guess[2:]\n        \n        # Check numbers\n        num_correct = sum((num1 == guess_nums[0], num2 == guess_nums[1]))\n        if num_correct != num_feedback:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check letters\n        let_correct = sum((let1 == guess_lets[0], let2 == guess_lets[1]))\n        if let_correct != let_feedback:\n            return False\n        \n        # Additional checks for too small or wrong position\n        if guess == '03HF' and num1 != '0':\n            return False\n        if guess == '75CP' and (let1 == 'C' or let2 == 'P'):\n            return False\n        if guess == '64YB' and num2 == '4':\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Iterate through all possible combinations\nfor num1, num2 in permutations(numbers, 2):\n    for let1, let2 in permutations(letters, 2):\n        if is_valid_combination(num1, num2, let1, let2):\n            password = [num1, num2, let1, let2]\n            print(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code systematically evaluates all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters, applying the feedback from each guess to eliminate invalid combinations. The correct password is printed once found."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code is overly simplistic and does not demonstrate symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the code, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically evaluates all possible combinations of numbers and letters based on the feedback from each guess. This approach should involve iterating through potential combinations and using logical deductions to narrow down the possibilities, ultimately arriving at the correct password."
