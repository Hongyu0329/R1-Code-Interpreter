    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (47LE), both numbers are incorrect and too large. So, the numbers must be less than 4.\n   - From Guess 2 (10FX), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. Since 0 is less than 4, it could be the correct number but in the wrong position.\n   - From Guess 3 (50ZK), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too large. Since 0 is already considered, 5 is incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 4 (48IM), both numbers are incorrect and too large. This confirms that the numbers are less than 4.\n   - From Guess 5 (86NM), both numbers are incorrect and too large. This further confirms the numbers are less than 4.\n   - From Guess 6 (39KL), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too large. Since 3 is less than 4, it could be the correct number but in the wrong position.\n\n   From the above analysis, the possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, and 3. Since 0 and 3 are mentioned as correct but in the wrong position, they are the numbers in the password.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (47LE), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 2 (10FX), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 3 (50ZK), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 4 (48IM), both letters are correct but in the wrong positions. So, I and M are the correct letters.\n   - From Guess 5 (86NM), one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. Since M is correct in Guess 4, N is incorrect.\n   - From Guess 6 (39KL), both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From the above analysis, the letters I and M are correct, but their positions need to be swapped from Guess 4.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The numbers are 0 and 3, and the letters are I and M.\n   - The correct password is 03MI.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the result:\n\n```python\n# The deduced password based on the analysis\npassword = [\"0\", \"3\", \"M\", \"I\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```"
