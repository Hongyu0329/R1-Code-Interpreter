    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and apply logical reasoning to narrow down the possibilities for each position in the password. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1 and 2, we know that 0, 2, 5, and 7 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too large. Since 7 is incorrect, 6 must be the correct number but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 4, 7 and 3 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, 6 is correct and in the correct position, and 9 is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 8, 6 is correct and in the correct position, and 8 is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 9, 9 and 8 are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 10, 6 is correct and in the correct position, and 0 is incorrect and too small.\n\n   From this, we deduce that the first number is 6, and the second number must be 1 (since 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 are all incorrect).\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, we know that P, G, R, S, U, A, Q, D, O, W, F, and I are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 4, Z and J are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, V is correct and in the correct position, and O is incorrect and too early.\n   - From guess 10, Y and G are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we deduce that the first letter is V, and the second letter must be X (since it is the only letter after V that hasn't been ruled out).\n\nThus, the password is 61VX. Let's write the Python code to output this result.\n\n```python\n# The deduced password based on the given conditions\npassword = [\"6\", \"1\", \"V\", \"X\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To implement a more systematic approach, we can create a function that evaluates each guess and its feedback to narrow down the possibilities for each character in the password. We'll use sets to keep track of possible candidates for each position and iteratively refine these sets based on the feedback from each guess.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Initialize Sets:** Create sets for possible numbers and letters for each position in the password.\n2. **Process Each Guess:** For each guess, update the sets based on the feedback:\n   - If a number or letter is incorrect, remove it from the possible candidates.\n   - If a number or letter is correct and in the correct position, fix it in that position.\n   - If a number or letter is correct but in the wrong position, adjust the sets accordingly.\n3. **Iterate Until Convergence:** Continue refining the sets until each position has exactly one candidate.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef deduce_password(guesses, feedbacks):\n    # Initialize possible candidates for each position\n    possible_numbers = [set(range(10)), set(range(10))]\n    possible_letters = [set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'), set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')]\n\n    for guess, feedback in zip(guesses, feedbacks):\n        numbers, letters = guess[:2], guess[2:]\n        num_feedback, let_feedback = feedback[:2], feedback[2:]\n\n        # Process number feedback\n        for i, (num, fb) in enumerate(zip(numbers, num_feedback)):\n            num = int(num)\n            if fb == 'correct':\n                possible_numbers[i] = {num}\n            elif fb == 'wrong position':\n                possible_numbers[1-i].discard(num)\n            elif fb == 'incorrect':\n                possible_numbers[0].discard(num)\n                possible_numbers[1].discard(num)\n\n        # Process letter feedback\n        for i, (let, fb) in enumerate(zip(letters, let_feedback)):\n            if fb == 'correct':\n                possible_letters[i] = {let}\n            elif fb == 'wrong position':\n                possible_letters[1-i].discard(let)\n            elif fb == 'incorrect':\n                possible_letters[0].discard(let)\n                possible_letters[1].discard(let)\n\n    # Extract the final password\n    password_numbers = [str(next(iter(s))) for s in possible_numbers]\n    password_letters = [next(iter(s)) for s in possible_letters]\n    password = password_numbers + password_letters\n\n    return password\n\n# Define the guesses and feedbacks\nguesses = [\"02PG\", \"50RS\", \"76SU\", \"73ZJ\", \"69WF\", \"37AQ\", \"05DO\", \"68PI\", \"98VO\", \"60YG\"]\nfeedbacks = [\n    ('incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect'),\n    ('incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect'),\n    ('wrong position', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect'),\n    ('incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect'),\n    ('correct', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect'),\n    ('incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect'),\n    ('incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect'),\n    ('correct', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect'),\n    ('incorrect', 'incorrect', 'correct', 'incorrect'),\n    ('correct', 'incorrect', 'incorrect', 'incorrect')\n]\n\n# Deduce the password\npassword = deduce_password(guesses, feedbacks)\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically evaluates each guess and feedback to deduce the password using a more algorithmic approach."

    "The current solution is correct, but the code is overly simplistic and does not demonstrate the use of symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the code, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically evaluates each guess and feedback to deduce the password. This could involve creating a function that iteratively narrows down the possibilities for each character in the password based on the feedback, rather than directly outputting the answer. This approach will better showcase the use of symbolic computing and efficient searching."
