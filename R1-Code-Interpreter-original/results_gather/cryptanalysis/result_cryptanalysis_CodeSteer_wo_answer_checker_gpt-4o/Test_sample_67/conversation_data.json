    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and narrow down the possibilities for each position in the password. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 5, 13: Numbers 7, 9, 8 are too large.\n   - From guesses 2, 9: Numbers 3, 2, 1 are too small.\n   - From guess 4: One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too large. So, 5 or 8 is correct.\n   - From guess 6: One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too large. So, 4 or 6 is correct.\n   - From guess 7: One number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too large. So, 4 is correct and in the first position.\n   - From guess 8: Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions. So, the numbers are 4 and 5.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 5, 13: Letters F, V, O, J, U, G are incorrect.\n   - From guesses 2, 3, 9, 12, 14: Letters P, Z, E, I, B, K are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6: One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too late. So, L is correct and in the third position.\n   - From guess 10: Both letters are incorrect and too late. So, V and W are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11: Both letters are incorrect and too late. So, X and N are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7: Both letters are incorrect and too early. So, H and I are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8: Both letters are incorrect. So, T and G are incorrect.\n\nFrom the above deductions, the numbers are 4 and 5, and the letters are L and Y. The correct password is 45LY.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"4\", \"5\", \"L\", \"Y\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To implement a more sophisticated algorithm, we can use a systematic approach to evaluate each condition and narrow down the possibilities. We'll create a function that iteratively tests combinations of numbers and letters, applying the feedback rules to eliminate incorrect options. This approach will involve:\n\n1. **Initialize Possible Values:**\n   - Create sets for possible numbers and letters based on the feedback from each guess.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Combinations:**\n   - Generate all possible combinations of numbers and letters.\n   - For each combination, apply the feedback rules to check if it satisfies all conditions.\n\n3. **Filter Combinations:**\n   - Eliminate combinations that do not satisfy the feedback rules.\n\n4. **Converge on Solution:**\n   - Once a combination satisfies all conditions, it is the correct password.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters, combination):\n    num1, num2, letter1, letter2 = combination\n    \n    # Feedback rules\n    feedbacks = [\n        (79, 'FV', 'both numbers are incorrect and too large;

    "The current solution seems to have deduced the correct password using logical reasoning based on the feedback from the guesses. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code is not complex enough for symbolic computing. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that systematically evaluates each condition and narrows down the possibilities using efficient searching techniques. This could involve creating a function that iteratively tests combinations of numbers and letters, applying the feedback rules to eliminate incorrect options, and converging on the correct solution."
