    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from the two guesses and use logical reasoning to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **First Guess: 87ID**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Either 8 or 7 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect number is too large, so it must be 8 or 7.\n   - Either I or D is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is too early in the alphabet, so it must be I or D.\n\n2. **Second Guess: 50FH**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Both 5 and 0 are too small, so the correct numbers must be larger than 5.\n   - Either F or H is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is too early in the alphabet, so it must be F or H.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- From the first guess, the correct number is either 8 or 7, and the incorrect number is too large, so it must be 8. Therefore, 7 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From the second guess, both numbers are too small, so the correct numbers must be larger than 5. Therefore, the correct numbers are 7 and a number larger than 7.\n- From the first guess, the correct letter is either I or D, and the incorrect letter is too early, so it must be I. Therefore, D is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From the second guess, the correct letter is either F or H, and the incorrect letter is too early, so it must be F. Therefore, H is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nCombining these deductions, the correct password is:\n- Numbers: 9 (since it must be larger than 7) and 7\n- Letters: D and H\n\nThe correct password is 97DH.\n\n```python\n# Output the deduced password\npassword = [\"9\", \"7\", \"D\", \"H\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic approach, we can implement a backtracking algorithm that explores all possible combinations of numbers and letters. The algorithm will use the feedback from each guess to prune the search space and find the correct combination efficiently.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1. **Define the Search Space:**\n   - Numbers: 0-9\n   - Letters: A-Z\n\n2. **Constraints from Feedback:**\n   - From the first guess (87ID):\n     - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - One number is incorrect and too large.\n     - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From the second guess (50FH):\n     - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n     - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm:**\n   - Generate all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters.\n   - For each combination, check if it satisfies the constraints from both guesses.\n   - If a combination satisfies all constraints, it is the correct password.\n\n4. **Output the Correct Password:**\n   - Print the correct combination in the specified format.\n\nHere's the implementation of the backtracking algorithm:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters):\n    # Check against the first guess: 87ID\n    # One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large\n    if not ((numbers[0] == '7' or numbers[1] == '7') and (numbers[0] != '8' and numbers[1] != '8')):\n        return False\n    # One letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet\n    if not ((letters[0] == 'D' or letters[1] == 'D') and (letters[0] != 'I' and letters[1] != 'I')):\n        return False\n\n    # Check against the second guess: 50FH\n    # Both numbers are incorrect and too small\n    if not (int(numbers[0]) > 5 and int(numbers[1]) > 5):\n        return False\n    # One letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet\n    if not ((letters[0] == 'H' or letters[1] == 'H') and (letters[0] != 'F' and letters[1] != 'F')):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters\nnumbers = [str(i) for i in range(10)]\nletters = [chr(i) for i in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1)]\n\nfor num_comb in permutations(numbers, 2):\n    for let_comb in permutations(letters, 2):\n        if is_valid_combination(num_comb, let_comb):\n            password = list(num_comb) + list(let_comb)\n            print(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n            break\n```"

    "The current solution uses basic logical reasoning and simple string formatting, which is not sufficient for complex symbolic computing. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that systematically explores all possible combinations of numbers and letters, taking into account the feedback from each guess. This could involve using backtracking or constraint satisfaction techniques to efficiently search for the correct combination. Aim to develop a solution that dynamically evaluates and narrows down possibilities based on the given conditions."
