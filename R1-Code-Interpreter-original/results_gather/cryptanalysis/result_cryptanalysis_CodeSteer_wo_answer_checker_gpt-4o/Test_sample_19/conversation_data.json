    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use logical reasoning to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **From Guess 18WV:**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   This suggests that either '1' or '8' is correct and in the correct position, and either 'W' or 'V' is correct and in the correct position.\n\n2. **From Guess 76GH:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   This means the numbers must be greater than 7 and 6, and the letters must be later in the alphabet than 'G' and 'H'.\n\n3. **From Guess 75LE:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   This confirms that the numbers must be greater than 7 and 5, and the letters must be later in the alphabet than 'L' and 'E'.\n\n4. **From Guess 12BZ:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   This suggests that the numbers must be greater than 2 and 1, and either 'B' or 'Z' is correct and in the correct position.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The numbers must be greater than 8 (from all feedbacks combined), so they are likely '9' and '0'.\n- The letters must be later than 'W', 'V', 'L', 'E', 'G', 'H', and 'B'. The only letters that fit this criteria and are not repeated are 'Y' and 'Z'.\n\nThus, the correct password is likely to be '98YZ'.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"9\", \"8\", \"Y\", \"Z\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To systematically deduce the password, we can implement a brute-force search algorithm that iteratively tests all possible combinations of numbers and letters. We'll use the feedback from each guess to filter out invalid combinations. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Define the possible range for numbers and letters:**\n   - Numbers: Since all numbers in the guesses are too small, the possible numbers are 9 and 0.\n   - Letters: Based on the feedback, the possible letters are those later in the alphabet than 'W', 'V', 'L', 'E', 'G', 'H', and 'B'. This leaves us with 'X', 'Y', 'Z'.\n\n2. **Iterate over all possible combinations of numbers and letters:**\n   - For each combination, check if it satisfies all the feedback conditions.\n\n3. **Output the combination that satisfies all conditions.**\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on feedback\npossible_numbers = ['9', '0']\npossible_letters = ['X', 'Y', 'Z']\n\n# All possible combinations of two numbers and two letters\ncombinations = permutations(possible_numbers, 2)\nletter_combinations = permutations(possible_letters, 2)\n\n# Function to check if a combination satisfies all conditions\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters):\n    # Check against each guess\n    # Guess 18WV\n    if not ((numbers[0] == '1' or numbers[1] == '8') and (letters[0] == 'W' or letters[1] == 'V')):\n        return False\n    # Guess 76GH\n    if not (numbers[0] > '7' and numbers[1] > '6' and letters[0] > 'G' and letters[1] > 'H'):\n        return False\n    # Guess 75LE\n    if not (numbers[0] > '7' and numbers[1] > '5' and letters[0] > 'L' and letters[1] > 'E'):\n        return False\n    # Guess 12BZ\n    if not ((numbers[0] > '2' and numbers[1] > '1') and (letters[0] == 'B' or letters[1] == 'Z')):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Iterate over all combinations\nfor num_comb in combinations:\n    for let_comb in letter_combinations:\n        if is_valid_combination(num_comb, let_comb):\n            password = list(num_comb + let_comb)\n            print(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all possible combinations of numbers and letters, checking each one against the feedback conditions.
