    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use the process of elimination to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\n1. **Guess: 25YN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - One of the numbers 2 or 5 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other number is incorrect and too small, so it must be less than 2 or 5.\n   - Both letters Y and N are incorrect and too late, so the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 42CQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - The correct numbers are greater than 4 and 2.\n   - Letters C and Q are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 76KC**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Either 7 or 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number is incorrect and too large, so it must be greater than 6 or 7.\n   - One of the letters K or C is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other letter is incorrect and too early, so it must be later in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 26SG**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Either 2 or 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number is incorrect and too small, so it must be less than 2 or 6.\n   - One of the letters S or G is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other letter is incorrect and too late, so it must be earlier in the alphabet.\n\n**Deducing the Password:**\n\n- From the feedback, the correct number in the first position is 7 (from guess 76KC).\n- The correct number in the second position is 3 (since 2 and 6 are incorrect in the second position, and 3 is greater than 2 and less than 6).\n- The correct letter in the third position is K (from guess 76KC).\n- The correct letter in the fourth position is F (since G is too late and C is too early, and F is between them).\n\nThus, the password is 73KF.\n\n```python\npassword = [\"7\", \"3\", \"K\", \"F\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",

    "Let's carefully review the feedback conditions and ensure that the logic in the `is_valid_combination` function accurately reflects the task's requirements. We'll also add detailed debug statements to trace the values of variables during execution.\n\n### Feedback Analysis\n\n1. **Guess: 25YN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 42CQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 76KC**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 26SG**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Revised Code with Debugging\n\nLet's implement the code with detailed debug statements:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters, guess, feedback):\n    num_correct_pos = 0\n    num_correct_wrong_pos = 0\n    num_incorrect_too_small = 0\n    num_incorrect_too_large = 0\n    letter_correct_pos = 0\n    letter_incorrect_too_early = 0\n    letter_incorrect_too_late = 0\n\n    # Check numbers\n    for i in range(2):\n        if numbers[i] == guess[i]:\n            num_correct_pos += 1\n        elif numbers[i] in guess[:2]:\n            num_correct_wrong_pos += 1\n        elif numbers[i] < guess[i]:\n            num_incorrect_too_small += 1\n        else:\n            num_incorrect_too_large += 1\n\n    # Check letters\n    for i in range(2):\n        if letters[i] == guess[i + 2]:\n            letter_correct_pos += 1\n        elif letters[i] < guess[i + 2]:\n            letter_incorrect_too_early += 1\n        else:\n            letter_incorrect_too_late += 1\n\n    # Validate against feedback\n    expected_feedback = (num_correct_pos, num_correct_wrong_pos, num_incorrect_too_small, num_incorrect_too_large, letter_correct_pos, letter_incorrect_too_early, letter_incorrect_too_late)\n    if feedback == expected_feedback:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef find_password():\n    feedbacks = [\n        ((2, 5, 'Y', 'N'), (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2)),\n        ((4, 2, 'C', 'Q'), (0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2)),\n        ((7, 6, 'K', 'C'), (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1)),\n        ((2, 6, 'S', 'G'), (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1))\n    ]\n\n    for num1 in range(10):\n        for num2 in range(10):\n            if num1 == num2:\n                continue\n            for letter1 in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':\n                for letter2 in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':\n                    if letter1 == letter2:\n                        continue\n                    valid = True\n                    for guess, feedback in feedbacks:\n                        if not is_valid_combination([num1, num2], [letter1, letter2], guess, feedback):\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    if valid:\n                        print(f\"Valid combination found: {num1}{num2}{letter1}{letter2}\")\n                        return [str(num1), str(num2), letter1, letter2]\n\npassword = find_password()\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```\n\n### Debugging Steps\n\n1. **Check Each Feedback Condition:**\n   - Ensure that the feedback conditions are correctly implemented in the `is_valid_combination` function.\n   - Verify that the feedback tuples match the task's conditions.\n\n2. **Add Debug Statements:**\n   - Print the current combination being tested.\n   - Print the expected feedback and the actual feedback calculated for each guess.\n\n3. **Trace Execution:**\n   - Use the debug statements to trace the values of variables and identify where the logic might be failing.\n\nBy following these steps, we can ensure that the code correctly identifies the valid password combination."

    "The current solution seems to be based on a simple deduction process without leveraging any advanced symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically evaluates all possible combinations of numbers and letters based on the given feedback. This could involve using constraint satisfaction techniques or backtracking algorithms to ensure all conditions are met. Aim to generate code that dynamically tests combinations and refines possibilities, rather than directly deducing the answer.",
    "The current code attempts to use a backtracking algorithm to find the correct password, but it seems to be returning `None`, indicating that the logic for validating combinations against feedback may not be correctly implemented. To improve the solution, ensure that the feedback validation logic accurately reflects the conditions given in the task. Double-check the feedback tuples and the conditions they represent. Additionally, consider adding debug statements to trace the values of variables during execution to identify where the logic might be failing. This will help refine the code to correctly identify the valid password combination.",
