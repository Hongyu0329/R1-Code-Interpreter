    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Guess: 93YW**\n   - Numbers: 9 and 3 are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - Letters: Y and W are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 34PL**\n   - Numbers: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect.\n   - Letters: P and L are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 14YH**\n   - Numbers: 1 and 4 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: Y and H are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 70FZ**\n   - Numbers: 7 and 0 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: F and Z are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 46GK**\n   - Numbers: 4 and 6 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: One letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 32RP**\n   - Numbers: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Letters: R and P are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 63VH**\n   - Numbers: One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect.\n   - Letters: V and H are incorrect.\n\n8. **Guess: 13NC**\n   - Numbers: One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Letters: N and C are incorrect.\n\n9. **Guess: 61BE**\n   - Numbers: 6 and 1 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: B and E are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n10. **Guess: 43KU**\n    - Numbers: One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect.\n    - Letters: One letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect.\n\nFrom the above information, we can deduce:\n\n- The correct numbers are 9 and 3, as per the first guess.\n- The letters must be earlier in the alphabet than Y and W, and later than B and E.\n- From guess 5, one of G or K is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 10, one of K or U is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nCombining these clues, the letters must be G and K, with G in the second position and K in the first position.\n\nThus, the password is 93KG.\n\n```python\n# Final answer\npassword = [\"9\", \"3\", \"K\", \"G\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To systematically deduce the password, we can use a constraint satisfaction approach. We'll maintain possible values for each position and iteratively apply the constraints from each guess to narrow down the possibilities. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Initialize Possible Values:**\n   - For numbers, initialize possible values for each position.\n   - For letters, initialize possible values for each position.\n\n2. **Apply Constraints:**\n   - For each guess, update the possible values based on the feedback.\n   - If a number or letter is confirmed in a position, fix it and remove it from other positions.\n   - If a number or letter is incorrect, remove it from all positions.\n\n3. **Iterate Until Convergence:**\n   - Continue applying constraints until the possible values for each position converge to a single value.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initialize possible values for each position\npossible_numbers = [{str(i) for i in range(10)} for _ in range(2)]\npossible_letters = [{chr(i) for i in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1)} for _ in range(2)]\n\n# Define the constraints based on the feedback\nconstraints = [\n    (\"93YW\", \"both numbers are correct and in the correct positions; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"34PL\", \"one number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"14YH\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"70FZ\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"46GK\", \"both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect.\"),\n    (\"32RP\", \"one number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"63VH\", \"one number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"13NC\", \"one number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect.\"),\n    (\"61BE\", \"both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\"),\n    (\"43KU\", \"one number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect.\")\n]\n\n# Function to apply constraints\ndef apply_constraints():\n    for guess, feedback in constraints:\n        numbers, letters = guess[:2], guess[2:]\n        \n        if \"both numbers are correct and in the correct positions\" in feedback:\n            possible_numbers[0] = {numbers[0]}\n            possible_numbers[1] = {numbers[1]}\n        \n        if \"one number is correct but in the wrong position\" in feedback:\n            if numbers[0] in possible_numbers[1]:\n                possible_numbers[1] = {numbers[0]}\n            if numbers[1] in possible_numbers[0]:\n                possible_numbers[0] = {numbers[1]}\n        \n        if \"both numbers are incorrect\" in feedback:\n            for i in range(2):\n                possible_numbers[i].discard(numbers[0])\n                possible_numbers[i].discard(numbers[1])\n        \n        if \"both letters are incorrect\" in feedback:\n            for i in range(2):\n                possible_letters[i].discard(letters[0])\n                possible_letters[i].discard(letters[1])\n        \n        if \"one letter is correct but in the wrong position\" in feedback:\n            if letters[0] in possible_letters[1]:\n                possible_letters[1] = {letters[0]}\n            if letters[1] in possible_letters[0]:\n                possible_letters[0] = {letters[1]}\n        \n        if \"both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet\" in feedback:\n            for i in range(2):\n                possible_letters[i] = {l for l in possible_letters[i] if l < letters[0] and l < letters[1]}\n        \n        if \"both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet\" in feedback:\n            for i in range(2):\n                possible_letters[i] = {l for l in possible_letters[i] if l > letters[0] and l > letters[1]}\n\n# Apply constraints iteratively\napply_constraints()\n\n# Extract the final password\npassword = [next(iter(possible_numbers[i])) for i in range(2)] + [next(iter(possible_letters[i])) for i in range(2)]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically applies the constraints from each guess to narrow down the possible values for each position in the password.

    "The current solution does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching to deduce the password. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that systematically evaluates each condition and narrows down the possibilities for each character in the password. Use data structures to track possible values for each position and apply constraints iteratively to refine the solution. This approach will ensure a more robust and accurate deduction of the password."
