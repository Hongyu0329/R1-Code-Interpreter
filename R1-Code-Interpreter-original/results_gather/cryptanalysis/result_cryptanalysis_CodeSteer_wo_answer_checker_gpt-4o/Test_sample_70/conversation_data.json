    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 1, 80 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2, 9 is correct and in the correct position, 1 is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 3, 5 is correct and in the correct position, 1 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, 9 is correct but in the wrong position, 1 is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 5, 3 and 8 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, 2 and 5 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, 2 is correct and in the correct position, 1 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, 4 and 8 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, 8 and 0 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 10, 4 and 3 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11, 9 and 2 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 12, 0 and 3 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 13, 2 and 3 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 14, 0 and 5 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 15, 6 and 0 are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, the only numbers that fit the criteria are 9 and 7. 9 is in the second position (from guess 2), and 7 is in the first position (from guess 7).\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1, Z and V are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2, P and E are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, D and H are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, H is correct and in the correct position, C is incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, C is correct but in the wrong position, A is incorrect and too early.\n   - From guess 6, F and G are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, G and K are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, F and L are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, D and L are incorrect.\n   - From guess 10, Z and O are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11, S is correct and in the correct position, C is incorrect.\n   - From guess 12, X is correct and in the correct position, O is incorrect.\n   - From guess 13, J and H are incorrect.\n   - From guess 14, T and Q are incorrect.\n   - From guess 15, Q and F are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, the letters that fit the criteria are X and S. X is in the third position (from guess 12), and S is in the fourth position (from guess 11).\n\nThus, the password is 79XS.\n\n```python\n# The deduced password based on the given conditions\npassword = [\"7\", \"9\", \"X\", \"S\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic and robust approach, we can use constraint satisfaction techniques. We'll represent each guess and its feedback as constraints and use a search algorithm to find the combination that satisfies all constraints. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Define the Problem:**\n   - We have two numbers and two letters.\n   - Each guess provides feedback that can be translated into constraints.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - For each guess, based on the feedback, we can deduce constraints about which numbers and letters are correct, incorrect, or in the wrong position.\n\n3. **Search for Solution:**\n   - Use a systematic search to evaluate all possible combinations of numbers and letters.\n   - Check each combination against all constraints.\n\n4. **Symbolic Computing:**\n   - Use symbolic variables to represent the numbers and letters.\n   - Use a constraint solver to find the solution.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach using the `itertools` library for generating combinations and a simple constraint checking function:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define possible numbers and letters\npossible_numbers = set(range(10))\npossible_letters = set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')\n\n# Define constraints based on feedback\nconstraints = [\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {8, 0} and n2 not in {8, 0} and l1 not in {'Z', 'V'} and l2 not in {'Z', 'V'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: (n1 == 9 and n2 != 1) or (n1 != 9 and n2 == 1) and l1 not in {'P', 'E'} and l2 not in {'P', 'E'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: (n1 == 5 and n2 != 1) or (n1 != 5 and n2 == 1) and l1 not in {'D', 'H'} and l2 not in {'D', 'H'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: (n1 == 9 and n2 != 1) or (n1 != 9 and n2 == 1) and (l1 == 'H' or l2 == 'H') and l1 not in {'C'} and l2 not in {'C'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {3, 8} and n2 not in {3, 8} and (l1 == 'C' or l2 == 'C') and l1 not in {'A'} and l2 not in {'A'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {2, 5} and n2 not in {2, 5} and l1 not in {'F', 'G'} and l2 not in {'F', 'G'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: (n1 == 2 and n2 != 1) or (n1 != 2 and n2 == 1) and l1 not in {'G', 'K'} and l2 not in {'G', 'K'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {4, 8} and n2 not in {4, 8} and l1 not in {'F', 'L'} and l2 not in {'F', 'L'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {8, 0} and n2 not in {8, 0} and l1 not in {'D', 'L'} and l2 not in {'D', 'L'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {4, 3} and n2 not in {4, 3} and l1 not in {'Z', 'O'} and l2 not in {'Z', 'O'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {9, 2} and n2 not in {9, 2} and (l1 == 'S' or l2 == 'S') and l1 not in {'C'} and l2 not in {'C'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {0, 3} and n2 not in {0, 3} and (l1 == 'X' or l2 == 'X') and l1 not in {'O'} and l2 not in {'O'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {2, 3} and n2 not in {2, 3} and l1 not in {'J', 'H'} and l2 not in {'J', 'H'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {0, 5} and n2 not in {0, 5} and l1 not in {'T', 'Q'} and l2 not in {'T', 'Q'},\n    lambda n1, n2, l1, l2: n1 not in {6, 0} and n2 not in {6, 0} and l1 not in {'Q', 'F'} and l2 not in {'Q', 'F'},\n]\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of numbers and letters\nfor n1, n2 in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for l1, l2 in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        if all(constraint(n1, n2, l1, l2) for constraint in constraints):\n            password = [str(n1), str(n2), l1, l2]\n            print(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code systematically checks each possible combination of numbers and letters against the constraints derived from the feedback. Once it finds a combination that satisfies all constraints, it prints the password."
