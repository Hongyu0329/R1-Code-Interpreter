    "To deduce the correct password, let's analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 98SO**\n   - Both numbers (9 and 8) are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 34ZW**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters (Z and W) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 91HL**\n   - Both numbers (9 and 1) are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 47OB**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (O and B) are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 65NA**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (N and A) are incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-step deduction:**\n\n- From guess 1, numbers 9 and 8 are too large, so the numbers must be less than 8.\n- From guess 2, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too small. This means one of 3 or 4 is correct, but not in the correct position.\n- From guess 3, numbers 9 and 1 are incorrect, so the numbers must be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- From guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too large. This means 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 5, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too large. This means 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n\nThus, the numbers are 4 and 6.\n\n- From guess 1, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect. So, either S or O is correct.\n- From guess 2, both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet, so the letters must be before Z and W.\n- From guess 3, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too early. So, either H or L is correct.\n- From guess 4, both letters are incorrect, so O and B are not in the password.\n- From guess 5, both letters are incorrect, so N and A are not in the password.\n\nFrom the above, S is correct and in the correct position, and H is correct and in the correct position.\n\nTherefore, the password is 46SH.\n\n```python\npassword = [\"4\", \"6\", \"S\", \"H\"]\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic approach, we can implement a backtracking algorithm. This algorithm will explore all possible combinations of numbers and letters, checking each combination against the given conditions. If a combination satisfies all conditions, it will be considered a valid solution.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Define the possible numbers and letters based on the feedback from the guesses.\n2. Use a backtracking approach to generate all possible combinations of two numbers and two letters.\n3. For each combination, check if it satisfies all the conditions.\n4. If a combination satisfies all conditions, print it as the solution.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters, combination):\n    # Check each condition\n    # Condition 1: 98SO\n    if not (combination[0] < 9 and combination[1] < 8 and\n            ((combination[2] == 'S' and combination[3] != 'O') or\n             (combination[2] != 'S' and combination[3] == 'O'))):\n        return False\n\n    # Condition 2: 34ZW\n    if not ((combination[0] == 3 or combination[1] == 3) and\n            (combination[0] != 4 and combination[1] != 4) and\n            combination[2] < 'Z' and combination[3] < 'W'):\n        return False\n\n    # Condition 3: 91HL\n    if not ((combination[2] == 'H' and combination[3] != 'L') or\n            (combination[2] != 'H' and combination[3] == 'L')):\n        return False\n\n    # Condition 4: 47OB\n    if not ((combination[0] == 4 and combination[1] != 7) or\n            (combination[0] != 4 and combination[1] == 7)):\n        return False\n\n    # Condition 5: 65NA\n    if not ((combination[0] == 6 and combination[1] != 5) or\n            (combination[0] != 6 and combination[1] == 5)):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef find_password():\n    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n    letters = ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'S']\n\n    for n1 in numbers:\n        for n2 in numbers:\n            if n1 == n2:\n                continue\n            for l1 in letters:\n                for l2 in letters:\n                    if l1 == l2:\n                        continue\n                    combination = [n1, n2, l1, l2]\n                    if is_valid_combination(numbers, letters, combination):\n                        return combination\n\npassword = find_password()\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```\n\nThis code systematically evaluates all possible combinations of numbers and letters, ensuring that each combination satisfies the given conditions. The `is_valid_combination` function checks each condition for a given combination, and the `find_password` function iterates through all possible combinations using nested loops.",
