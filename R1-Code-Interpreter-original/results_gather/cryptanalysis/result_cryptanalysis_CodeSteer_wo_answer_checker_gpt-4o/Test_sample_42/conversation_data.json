    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and apply logical reasoning to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, and 3, we know that numbers 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 9 is too large, the correct number must be 2 or 8.\n   - From guess 5, both numbers are incorrect and too large, so 8 is too large, leaving 2 as the correct number.\n   - From guess 6, both numbers are incorrect, confirming that 2 is not in the correct position in guess 4. Therefore, the correct numbers are 2 and another number less than 3 (since 3 is incorrect and 2 is correct).\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, and 3, letters E, K, O, and P are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so J and C are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since J is incorrect, X is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 6, both letters are correct but in the wrong positions, confirming that X and W are the correct letters.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The correct numbers are 2 and 1 (since 1 is the only number less than 3 that hasn't been ruled out).\n- The correct letters are W and X, with W in the first position and X in the second position.\n\nThus, the password is [1, 2, 'W', 'X'].\n\n```python\n# Output the deduced password\npassword = [1, 2, 'W', 'X']\nprint(f\"<<< {password} >>>\")\n```",
    "To implement a more sophisticated solution, we can use a backtracking approach to systematically evaluate all possible combinations of numbers and letters.
