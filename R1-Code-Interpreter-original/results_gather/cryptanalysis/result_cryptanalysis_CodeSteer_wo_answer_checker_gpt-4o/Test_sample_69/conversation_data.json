    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use logical reasoning to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **From Guess 48TY:**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   This means:\n   - Either 4 or 8 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect number is too large, so it must be 8.\n   - Either T or Y is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is too late, so it must be Y.\n\n2. **From Guess 61LS:**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   This means:\n   - Numbers 6 and 1 are not in the password.\n   - Letters L and S are not in the password.\n\n3. **From Guess 21KP:**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   This means:\n   - Number 2 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - Number 1 is incorrect and too small.\n   - Letter K is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - Letter P is incorrect and too early.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- From the above analysis, the correct numbers are 2 and 4 (since 4 is the only remaining number from the first guess that fits the criteria).\n- The correct letters are K and T (since T is the only remaining letter from the first guess that fits the criteria).\n\nThus, the password is 24KT.\n\n```python\npassword = [\"2\", \"4\", \"K\", \"T\"]\nprint(password)\n```"
