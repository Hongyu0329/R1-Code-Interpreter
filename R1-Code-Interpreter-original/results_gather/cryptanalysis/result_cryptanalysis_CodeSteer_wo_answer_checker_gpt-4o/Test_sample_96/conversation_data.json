    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities step by step. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 14, we know that 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 4 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, we know that 3 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 8, both numbers are too large, so 5 and 8 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11, 4 is incorrect and too large, so 4 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 12, 0 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - Therefore, the numbers are 3 and 0.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, we know that Q, S, Y, M, B, U, R, W, P, C, A, O, and G are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect. Since I and J are the only letters left, one of them must be correct.\n   - From guess 8, J is incorrect, so I is correct.\n   - From guess 12, both letters are too early in the alphabet, so C and A are incorrect.\n   - Therefore, the letters are I and H.\n\nCombining the information, the password is:\n\n```python\npassword = [\"3\", \"0\", \"I\", \"H\"]\nprint(password)\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more systematic approach, we can use constraint satisfaction techniques. We'll define constraints based on the feedback from each guess and use a search algorithm to find the solution that satisfies all constraints. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Define Variables and Domains:**\n   - Numbers: Two distinct digits from 0 to 9.\n   - Letters: Two distinct letters from A to Z.\n\n2. **Define Constraints:**\n   - Based on the feedback from each guess, define constraints for numbers and letters.\n\n3. **Search for Solution:**\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to search for a combination of numbers and letters that satisfies all constraints.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define possible numbers and letters\npossible_numbers = set(range(10))\npossible_letters = set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')\n\n# Define constraints based on feedback\nconstraints = [\n    lambda n, l: n[0] not in {1, 6} and n[1] not in {1, 6} and l[0] < 'Q' and l[1] < 'S',\n    lambda n, l: (n[0] == 2 or n[1] == 2) and (n[0] != 3 and n[1] != 3) and l[0] < 'Y' and l[1] < 'Q',\n    lambda n, l: n[0] not in {9, 2} and n[1] not in {9, 2} and l[0] != 'F' and l[1] != 'Q',\n    lambda n, l: (n[0] == 1 or n[1] == 1) and (n[0] != 3 and n[1] != 3) and l[0] != 'M' and l[1] != 'S',\n    lambda n, l: n[0] not in {5, 1} and n[1] not in {5, 1} and l[0] != 'B' and l[1] != 'U',\n    lambda n, l: n[0] not in {6, 2} and n[1] not in {6, 2} and l[0] < 'R' and l[1] < 'Q',\n    lambda n, l: (n[0] == 3 and n[1] != 7) and l[0] != 'H' and l[1] != 'S',\n    lambda n, l: n[0] < 5 and n[1] < 8 and (l[0] == 'I' or l[1] == 'I') and (l[0] != 'J' and l[1] != 'J'),\n    lambda n, l: n[0] < 4 and n[1] < 6 and l[0] != 'W' and l[1] != 'B',\n    lambda n, l: n[0] < 4 and n[1] < 6 and l[0] != 'B' and l[1] != 'P',\n    lambda n, l: (n[0] == 3 or n[1] == 3) and n[0] < 4 and n[1] < 3 and l[0] < 'P' and l[1] < 'R',\n    lambda n, l: (n[0] == 0 and n[1] != 6) and l[0] > 'C' and l[1] > 'A',\n    lambda n, l: (n[0] == 0 and n[1] != 9) and l[0] != 'Q' and l[1] != 'C',\n    lambda n, l: n[0] < 9 and n[1] < 4 and l[0] != 'O' and l[1] != 'G'\n]\n\n# Search for the correct combination\nfor numbers in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for letters in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        if all(constraint(numbers, letters) for constraint in constraints):\n            password = [str(numbers[0]), str(numbers[1]), letters[0], letters[1]]\n            print(password)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code uses permutations to generate all possible combinations of numbers and letters, then checks each combination against the constraints derived from the feedback. The first combination that satisfies all constraints is printed as the password."
