    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 91SF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 03HF**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 75CP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 64YB**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n### Analyzing the Conditions:\n\n- From Guess 1, both numbers 9 and 1 are incorrect. One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect. Since S and F are the letters, one of them is correct and in the correct position.\n\n- From Guess 2, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is too small, 3 is correct and in the correct position. Both letters H and F are incorrect.\n\n- From Guess 3, both numbers 7 and 5 are incorrect. One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. Since C and P are the letters, one of them is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n- From Guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect. Since 6 is incorrect, 4 is correct and in the correct position. Both letters Y and B are incorrect.\n\n### Deducing the Password:\n\n- From the number analysis:\n  - 3 is correct and in the correct position (from Guess 2).\n  - 4 is correct and in the correct position (from Guess 4).\n\n- From the letter analysis:\n  - From Guess 1, S or F is correct and in the correct position.\n  - From Guess 3, C is correct but in the wrong position.\n  - From Guess 2 and 4, H, F, Y, and B are incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct letters are S and C, with S in the correct position from Guess 1 and C in the wrong position from Guess 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe password is 34SC, with 3 and 4 as the numbers and S and C as the letters.\n\n<<< [\"3\", \"4\", \"S\", \"C\"] >>>"
