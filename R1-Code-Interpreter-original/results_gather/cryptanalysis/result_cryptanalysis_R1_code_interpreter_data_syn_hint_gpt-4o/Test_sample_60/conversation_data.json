    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from each guess. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 15PU**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - One of the numbers 1 or 5 is correct but misplaced.\n   - The other number is incorrect and too large, so it must be 5.\n   - Both letters P and U are incorrect and too late, so the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 43EH**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Numbers 4 and 3 are too large, so the correct numbers are less than 3.\n   - One of the letters E or H is correct but misplaced.\n   - The other letter is incorrect and too early, so it must be E.\n\n3. **Guess: 94HG**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Numbers 9 and 4 are too large, so the correct numbers are less than 4.\n   - One of the letters H or G is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other letter is incorrect and too early, so it must be G.\n\n4. **Guess: 36NW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Numbers 3 and 6 are too large, so the correct numbers are less than 3.\n   - Both letters N and W are incorrect and too late, so the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 39FU**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Numbers 3 and 9 are too large, so the correct numbers are less than 3.\n   - Both letters F and U are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 27JZ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Numbers 2 and 7 are too large, so the correct numbers are less than 2.\n   - One of the letters J or Z is correct but misplaced.\n   - The other letter is incorrect and too late, so it must be Z.\n\nFrom the above deductions, the possible numbers are 0 and 1, and the possible letters are A, B, C, D, and J. Let's use this information to find the correct combination.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on deductions\npossible_numbers = ['0', '1']\npossible_letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'J']\n\n# Generate all permutations of the numbers and letters\nnumber_permutations = list(permutations(possible_numbers, 2))\nletter_permutations = list(permutations(possible_letters, 2))\n\n# Check each combination against the conditions\nfor num_perm in number_permutations:\n    for let_perm in letter_permutations:\n        # Construct the guess\n        guess = num_perm + let_perm\n        \n        # Check against each condition\n        if (guess[0] in '15' and guess[1] not in '15' and guess[2] not in 'PU' and guess[3] not in 'PU' and\n            guess[0] not in '43' and guess[1] not in '43' and (guess[2] in 'EH' or guess[3] in 'EH') and\n            guess[0] not in '94' and guess[1] not in '94' and (guess[2] == 'H' or guess[3] == 'H') and\n            guess[0] not in '36' and guess[1] not in '36' and guess[2] not in 'NW' and guess[3] not in 'NW' and\n            guess[0] not in '39' and guess[1] not in '39' and guess[2] not in 'FU' and guess[3] not in 'FU' and\n            guess[0] not in '27' and guess[1] not in '27' and (guess[2] in 'JZ' or guess[3] in 'JZ')):\n            print(guess)\n```\n\nThe code will generate all possible combinations of the numbers and letters and check them against the conditions to find the correct password."
