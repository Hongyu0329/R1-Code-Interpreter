    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1 (97YS), both numbers are too large.\n   - From guess 2 (70GF), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3 (17YC), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (72XP), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (02SV), both numbers are too small.\n   - From guess 6 (96CL), one number is correct and one is too large.\n   - From guess 7 (54EW), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (02XS), both numbers are too small.\n   - From guess 9 (01GF), both numbers are too small.\n   - From guess 10 (40GU), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11 (09XR), both numbers are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - The numbers must be between 3 and 5, as numbers less than 3 are too small and numbers greater than 5 are too large.\n   - From guess 6, one number is correct and one is too large, so one of the numbers is 5.\n   - From guess 7, both numbers are incorrect, so 4 is not a correct number.\n   - Therefore, the numbers are 3 and 5.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1 (97YS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2 (70GF), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 3 (17YC), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (72XP), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (02SV), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6 (96CL), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7 (54EW), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (02XS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9 (01GF), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 10 (40GU), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11 (09XR), one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - The letters must be later in the alphabet than G, F, C, L, E, W, S, and earlier than R.\n   - From guess 11, one letter is correct and in the correct position, so X is a correct letter.\n   - The other letter must be earlier than R and later than the other incorrect letters, so it is likely to be Q.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 3, 5, X, Q.\n\n<<< [\"3\", \"5\", \"X\", \"Q\"] >>>"
