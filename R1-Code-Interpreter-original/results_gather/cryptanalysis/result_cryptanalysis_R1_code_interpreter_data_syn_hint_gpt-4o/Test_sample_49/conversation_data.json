    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 75KB**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - This implies that one of the numbers 7 or 5 is correct but misplaced, and the other is too large. Both K and B are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 15UA**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - This implies that one of the numbers 1 or 5 is correct but misplaced, and the other is too small. U and A are the correct letters in the correct positions.\n\n3. **Guess: 09KJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - This eliminates 0 and 9 as possible numbers and K and J as possible letters.\n\n4. **Guess: 05PB**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - This implies that one of the numbers 0 or 5 is correct but misplaced, and the other is too small. P and B are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 69DB**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - This eliminates 6 and 9 as possible numbers and D and B as possible letters.\n\n6. **Guess: 54ZF**\n   - Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - This confirms that 5 and 4 are the correct numbers in the correct positions. Z and F are incorrect.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- The correct numbers are 5 and 4, in that order.\n- The correct letters are U and A, in that order.\n\nThus, the password is 54UA.\n\n<<< [\"5\", \"4\", \"U\", \"A\"] >>>"
