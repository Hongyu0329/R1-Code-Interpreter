    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct password based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 28MV**\n   - Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions: This means the numbers are 2 and 8.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: Either M or V is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet: The incorrect letter is earlier in the alphabet than the correct letter.\n\n2. **Guess: 41FX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: This confirms that 2 and 8 are the correct numbers.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Neither F nor X is in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 58VP**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: Since 8 is in the second position, it is correct.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect: 5 is incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: Either V or P is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet: The incorrect letter is earlier in the alphabet than the correct letter.\n\n4. **Guess: 93IT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Confirms 2 and 8 are correct.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: Either I or T is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet: The incorrect letter is earlier in the alphabet than the correct letter.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n- The numbers are 2 and 8.\n- From guess 1, M or V is correct. From guess 3, V or P is correct. From guess 4, I or T is correct.\n- Since F and X are incorrect, and considering the feedback about letters being too early in the alphabet, we can deduce:\n  - M is correct and in the correct position (from guess 1).\n  - V is correct but in the wrong position (from guess 3).\n\nThus, the password is 2, 8, M, V.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the conditions:\n- Condition 1: 28MV - Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions; M is correct and in the correct position.\n- Condition 2: 41FX - Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n- Condition 3: 58VP - 8 is correct and in the correct position; V is correct but in the wrong position.\n- Condition 4: 93IT - Both numbers are incorrect; M is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nThe password is confirmed as 28MV.\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"8\", \"M\", \"V\"] >>>"
