    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the 14 guesses. Let's analyze the feedback step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 1 (79FV), both numbers are too large.\n   - From guess 2 (32PZ), both numbers are too small.\n   - From guess 3 (09EF), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (58QD), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is too large.\n   - From guess 5 (79OJ), both numbers are too large.\n   - From guess 6 (64LY), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is too large.\n   - From guess 7 (48HI), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is too large.\n   - From guess 8 (45TG), both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - From guess 9 (31IB), both numbers are too small.\n   - From guess 10 (94VW), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is too large.\n   - From guess 11 (70XN), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 12 (70BI), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 13 (89UG), both numbers are too large.\n   - From guess 14 (70KG), both numbers are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce that the correct numbers are 4 and 5, as they are the only numbers that fit all the conditions, especially from guess 8 where both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1 (79FV), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2 (32PZ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 3 (09EF), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 4 (58QD), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (79OJ), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6 (64LY), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7 (48HI), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 8 (45TG), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9 (31IB), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 10 (94VW), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 11 (70XN), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 12 (70BI), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 13 (89UG), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 14 (70KG), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce that the correct letters are M and L. From guess 6 (64LY), L is correct and in the correct position, and Y is too late in the alphabet. M fits the criteria of being between E and P (from guesses 3 and 2) and not being too early or too late.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 45ML.\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"5\", \"M\", \"L\"] >>>"
