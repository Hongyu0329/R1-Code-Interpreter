    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses.\n\nLet's analyze the feedback:\n\n1. **Guess: 64RY**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers 6 and 4, and the letters R and Y are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 51MB**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers 5 and 1, and the letters M and B are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 29PV**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers 2 and 9, and the letters P and V are not in the password.\n\n4. **Guess: 71EW**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect; both letters are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 7 or 1 is correct but in the wrong position, and the letters E and W are correct but in the wrong positions.\n\nFrom the above conclusions, we can deduce:\n- The numbers in the password are not 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, or 9. Therefore, the possible numbers are 0, 3, 7, and 8.\n- Since one of the numbers in the guess 71EW is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect, the correct number must be 7 or 1. Since 1 is already ruled out, the correct number is 7.\n- The other number must be from the remaining possibilities: 0, 3, or 8.\n- The letters in the password are not R, Y, M, B, P, or V. Therefore, the possible letters are E and W, which are confirmed to be correct but in the wrong positions.\n\nNow, let's use this information to find the correct combination. We know:\n- One number is 7, and it must be in the second position (since it was in the first position in the guess 71EW).\n- The other number must be 0, 3, or 8.\n- The letters E and W must be in the first and second positions, respectively.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the correct combination:\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the deductions\npossible_numbers = [0, 3, 8]\ncorrect_number = 7\ncorrect_letters = ['E', 'W']\n\n# Iterate over possible numbers to find the correct combination\nfor num in possible_numbers:\n    # Construct the combination\n    combination = [num, correct_number, correct_letters[1], correct_letters[0]]\n    print(combination)\n```\n\nThis script will output the possible combinations based on the deductions. Let's execute it to find the correct password.",
    "The code execution provided us with three possible combinations based on the deductions:\n\n1. [0, 7, 'W', 'E']\n2. [3, 7, 'W', 'E']\n3. [8, 7, 'W', 'E']\n\nLet's analyze these combinations further:\n\n- From the feedback of the fourth guess (71EW), we know that one number is correct but in the wrong position, and both letters are correct but in the wrong positions. This means:\n  - The number 7 is correct and should be in the second position.\n  - The letters E and W are correct but should be swapped in their positions.\n\nGiven this, the correct combination should have:\n- The number 7 in the second position.\n- The letters W and E in the first and second positions, respectively.\n\nFrom the possible combinations, [3, 7, 'W', 'E'] fits this pattern, as it places 7 in the second position and swaps the letters W and E.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [3, 7, 'W', 'E'] >>>"
