    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from each guess. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 47LE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large: This means the numbers must be less than 4 and 7.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: This means L and E are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 10FX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: This means either 1 or 0 is in the password, but not in the position guessed.\n   - One number is incorrect: This means either 1 or 0 is not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: This means F and X are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 50ZK**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: This means either 5 or 0 is in the password, but not in the position guessed.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large: This means either 5 or 0 is not in the password, and the incorrect one is too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: This means Z and K are not in the password.\n\n4. **Guess: 48IM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large: This means the numbers must be less than 4 and 8.\n   - Both letters are correct but in the wrong positions: This means I and M are in the password but swapped.\n\n5. **Guess: 86NM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large: This means the numbers must be less than 8 and 6.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: This means either N or M is in the password, but not in the position guessed.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet: This means either N or M is not in the password, and the incorrect one is too late in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 39KL**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: This means either 3 or 9 is in the password, but not in the position guessed.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large: This means either 3 or 9 is not in the password, and the incorrect one is too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: This means K and L are not in the password.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n- The numbers must be less than 4, 7, 8, and 6. So, the possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3.\n- From guesses 2 and 3, we know that 0 is incorrect (since it appears in both and is incorrect in one of them), so the possible numbers are 1, 2, 3.\n- From guess 6, 9 is incorrect and too large, so the possible numbers are 1, 2, 3.\n- From guess 2, 1 is correct but in the wrong position, so 1 is in the password.\n- From guess 3, 5 is incorrect and too large, so the possible numbers are 1, 2, 3.\n- From guess 6, 3 is correct but in the wrong position, so 3 is in the password.\n- The numbers are 1 and 3.\n\nFor the letters:\n- From guess 4, I and M are correct but swapped.\n- From guess 5, M is correct but in the wrong position, and N is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n- The letters are I and M.\n\nThus, the password is [1, 3, I, M].\n\n<<< [\"1\", \"3\", \"I\", \"M\"] >>>"
