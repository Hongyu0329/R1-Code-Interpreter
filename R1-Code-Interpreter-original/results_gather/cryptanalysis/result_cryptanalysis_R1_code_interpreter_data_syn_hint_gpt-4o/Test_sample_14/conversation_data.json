    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 25YN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 42CQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 76KC**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 26SG**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From **Guess 2 (42CQ)**, both numbers are too small, so the numbers must be greater than 4 and 2.\n- From **Guess 3 (76KC)**, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is too large. Since 7 is greater than 4 and 2, it could be the correct number in the correct position. Therefore, 6 is too large, and the other number must be less than 6.\n- From **Guess 4 (26SG)**, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is too small. Since 2 is too small, 6 cannot be the correct number. Therefore, 7 is the correct number in the first position, and the other number must be less than 6 but greater than 4, which is 5.\n- For the letters:\n  - From **Guess 1 (25YN)**, both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet, so the letters must be earlier than Y and N.\n  - From **Guess 2 (42CQ)**, both letters are incorrect, so C and Q are not in the password.\n  - From **Guess 3 (76KC)**, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is too early. Since C is incorrect, K is correct and in the correct position.\n  - From **Guess 4 (26SG)**, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is too late. Since S is too late, G is incorrect, and K is correct. Therefore, the other letter must be earlier than G and later than C, which is D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correct combination is 75KD.\n\nLet's verify this with the conditions:\n\n- **75KD**:\n  - For **Guess 1 (25YN)**: 5 is correct but in the wrong position; 2 is too small; K and D are earlier than Y and N.\n  - For **Guess 2 (42CQ)**: 7 and 5 are greater than 4 and 2; K and D are not C and Q.\n  - For **Guess 3 (76KC)**: 7 is correct and in the correct position; 5 is less than 6; K is correct and in the correct position; D is later than C.\n  - For **Guess 4 (26SG)**: 7 is correct and in the correct position; 5 is greater than 2; K is correct and in the correct position; D is earlier than G.\n\nThe password is confirmed as 75KD.\n\n<<< [\"7\", \"5\", \"K\", \"D\"] >>>"
