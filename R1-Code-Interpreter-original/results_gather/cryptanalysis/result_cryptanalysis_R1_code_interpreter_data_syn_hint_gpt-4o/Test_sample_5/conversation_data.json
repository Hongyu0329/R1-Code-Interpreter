    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 20KJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 60SC**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 39OQ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 09BV**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Analyzing the Numbers:\n- From Guess 1, both numbers (2, 0) are too small.\n- From Guess 2, one number (6) is correct but in the wrong position, and the other number (0) is too small.\n- From Guess 3, one number (3) is correct and in the correct position, and the other number (9) is too large.\n- From Guess 4, both numbers (0, 9) are incorrect.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- The correct numbers are 3 and 6.\n- 3 is in the correct position in Guess 3, so it must be the first number.\n- 6 is correct but in the wrong position in Guess 2, so it must be the second number.\n\n### Analyzing the Letters:\n- From Guess 1, both letters (K, J) are incorrect.\n- From Guess 2, one letter (S) is correct but in the wrong position, and the other letter (C) is incorrect.\n- From Guess 3, both letters (O, Q) are incorrect.\n- From Guess 4, one letter (B) is correct and in the correct position, and the other letter (V) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- The correct letters are B and S.\n- B is in the correct position in Guess 4, so it must be the first letter.\n- S is correct but in the wrong position in Guess 2, so it must be the second letter.\n\nThus, the correct combination is:\n- Numbers: 3, 6\n- Letters: B, S\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<< [\"3\", \"6\", \"B\", \"S\"] >>>"
