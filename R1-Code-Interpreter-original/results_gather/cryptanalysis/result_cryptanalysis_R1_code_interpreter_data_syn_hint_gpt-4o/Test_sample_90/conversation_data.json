    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 20VX** - Both numbers are incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect.\n2. **Guess: 73GA** - Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n3. **Guess: 13KM** - Both numbers are incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n4. **Guess: 74CD** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n5. **Guess: 57GT** - Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n6. **Guess: 32XO** - Both numbers are incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect.\n7. **Guess: 82EL** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n8. **Guess: 25DA** - Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n9. **Guess: 87WU** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n10. **Guess: 95ZM** - Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- From guesses 1, 3, and 6, we know that numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 are too small.\n- From guess 2, numbers 7 and 3 are incorrect.\n- From guess 4, one of the numbers 7 or 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 5, numbers 5 and 7 are incorrect.\n- From guess 7, number 8 is correct and in the correct position, and number 2 is too small.\n- From guess 9, number 8 is correct and in the correct position, and number 7 is incorrect.\n- From guess 10, numbers 9 and 5 are incorrect.\n\nFrom the above, we deduce that the first number is 8, and the second number must be greater than 4 and not 5, 7, or 9. Therefore, the second number is 6.\n\n- From guesses 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, letters G, A, K, M, C, D, E, L, T are too early in the alphabet.\n- From guess 9, letter W is correct and in the correct position, and letter U is incorrect.\n- From guess 10, letter Z is correct and in the correct position, and letter M is too early.\n\nThus, the letters are Z and W.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correct combination is 86ZW.\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"6\", \"Z\", \"W\"] >>>"
