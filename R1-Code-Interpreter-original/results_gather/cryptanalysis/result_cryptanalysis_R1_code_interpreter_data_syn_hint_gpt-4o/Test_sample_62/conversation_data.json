    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from each guess. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 13GO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: G or O is correct and in the correct position. The incorrect letter is too early, so it must be G or O.\n\n2. **Guess: 26LC**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Either 2 or 6 is correct but in the wrong position. L and C are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 95SX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 9 and 5 are incorrect. S and X are too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 94UG**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 9 and 4 are incorrect. U and G are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 12AT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 1 and 2 are incorrect. A and T are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 61KJ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Number 6 is correct and in the correct position. K and J are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 56GL**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Number 5 is incorrect. Number 6 is correct but in the wrong position. G and L are incorrect.\n\n8. **Guess: 37BM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 3 and 7 are incorrect. B and M are incorrect.\n\n9. **Guess: 24IW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 2 and 4 are incorrect. I is correct and in the correct position. W is too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n- The correct numbers are 0 and 6, with 6 in the second position.\n- The correct letters are O and I, with I in the third position.\n\nThus, the password is [0, 6, I, O].\n\nLet's verify this by checking the conditions:\n\n- Condition 1: 13GO - O is correct and in the correct position.\n- Condition 2: 26LC - 6 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- Condition 3: 95SX - Both letters are incorrect and too late.\n- Condition 4: 94UG - Both letters are incorrect.\n- Condition 5: 12AT - Both letters are incorrect.\n- Condition 6: 61KJ - 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n- Condition 7: 56GL - 6 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- Condition 8: 37BM - Both letters are incorrect.\n- Condition 9: 24IW - I is correct and in the correct position.\n\nThe password is consistent with all conditions.\n\n<<< [\"0\", \"6\", \"I\", \"O\"] >>>"
