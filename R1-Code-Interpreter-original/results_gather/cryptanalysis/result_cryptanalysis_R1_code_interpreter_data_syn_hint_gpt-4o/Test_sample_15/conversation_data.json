    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 80YF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   This means the numbers 8 and 0, and the letters Y and F are not part of the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 50MH**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   This implies:\n   - Either 5 or 0 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The incorrect number is too small, so it must be 0.\n   - The letters M and H are too early, so the correct letters are later in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 14TD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   This means:\n   - Numbers 1 and 4 are too small.\n   - Letters T and D are too early.\n\n4. **Guess: 76MO**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   This implies:\n   - Either 7 or 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The incorrect number is too large, so it must be 7.\n   - Letters M and O are too early.\n\n5. **Guess: 09ZV**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n   This means:\n   - Numbers 0 and 9 are not part of the password.\n   - Letters Z and V are correct and in the correct positions.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n- The correct numbers are 5 and 6, with 5 in the first position and 6 in the second position.\n- The correct letters are Z and V, with Z in the third position and V in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the password is 56ZV.\n\n<<< [\"5\", \"6\", \"Z\", \"V\"] >>>"
