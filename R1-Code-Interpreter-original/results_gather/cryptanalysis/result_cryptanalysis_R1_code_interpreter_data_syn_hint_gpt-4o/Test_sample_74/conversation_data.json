    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 80YC** - Both numbers and both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 8, 0 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: Y, C are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 58LT** - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 5 or 8 is correct but in the wrong position; 5 is incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: L, T are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 13QW** - Both numbers and both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 1, 3 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: Q, W are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 36IL** - Both numbers and both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 3, 6 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: I, L are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 57CF** - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - Numbers: 5 or 7 is correct but in the wrong position; 5 is incorrect and too large.\n   - Letters: C is correct and in the correct position; F is incorrect and too early.\n\n6. **Guess: 46KW** - Both numbers and both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 4, 6 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: K, W are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 50GD** - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 5 or 0 is correct but in the wrong position; 0 is incorrect and too small.\n   - Letters: G, D are incorrect.\n\n8. **Guess: 05LX** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 0 is incorrect and too small; 5 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - Letters: L, X are incorrect.\n\n9. **Guess: 96SG** - Both numbers are incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Numbers: 9, 6 are incorrect.\n   - Letters: S, G are incorrect.\n\n10. **Guess: 45XI** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n    - Numbers: 5 is correct and in the correct position; 4 is incorrect.\n    - Letters: X, I are incorrect.\n\n11. **Guess: 64DF** - Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n    - Numbers: 6, 4 are incorrect.\n    - Letters: D is correct and in the correct position; F is incorrect and too early.\n\n12. **Guess: 31SE** - Both numbers and both letters are incorrect.\n    - Numbers: 3, 1 are incorrect.\n    - Letters: S, E are incorrect.\n\n13. **Guess: 03LZ** - Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect.\n    - Numbers: 0, 3 are incorrect.\n    - Letters: L is incorrect; Z is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can deduce:\n- The correct numbers are 2 and 5, with 5 in the second position.\n- The correct letters are C and Z, with C in the third position.\n\nThus, the password is [2, 5, C, Z].\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"5\", \"C\", \"Z\"] >>>"
