    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 03OQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 76EC**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 83FO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 47OF**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 87LK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- From conditions 1 and 2, the possible numbers are between 4 and 6.\n- From condition 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too large. This means 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 3, the correct letter in the correct position is 'F'.\n- From condition 4, 'O' is correct but in the wrong position, and 'F' is incorrect and too late. This means 'O' should be in the first letter position.\n- From condition 5, 'L' is correct and in the correct position, and 'K' is incorrect and too late. This means 'L' is the second letter.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The first number is 4.\n- The second number is 5 (since 6 is too large).\n- The first letter is 'O'.\n- The second letter is 'L'.\n\nThus, the password is 45OL.\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"5\", \"O\", \"L\"] >>>"
