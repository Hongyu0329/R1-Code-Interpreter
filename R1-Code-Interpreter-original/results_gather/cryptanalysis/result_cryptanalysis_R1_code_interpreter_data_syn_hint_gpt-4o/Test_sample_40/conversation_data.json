    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from each guess. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 17LN**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 1 and 7, and letters L and N are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 52MG**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 5 or 2 is correct and in the correct position. Both letters M and G are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 39MH**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 3 and 9, and letters M and H are not in the password.\n\n4. **Guess: 85QP**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 8 or 5 is correct and in the correct position. One of the letters Q or P is correct and in the correct position.\n\n5. **Guess: 75OJ**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 7 and 5, and letters O and J are not in the password.\n\n6. **Guess: 40AG**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 4 and 0 are not in the password. One of the letters A or G is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n- Possible numbers: 2, 8 (since 5, 7, 1, 3, 9, 4, 0 are eliminated)\n- Possible letters: Q, P, A (since L, N, M, H, O, J, G are eliminated)\n\nNow, let's determine the correct positions:\n- From guess 2, either 5 or 2 is correct and in the correct position. Since 5 is eliminated, 2 is correct and in the first position.\n- From guess 4, either 8 or 5 is correct and in the correct position. Since 5 is eliminated, 8 is correct and in the second position.\n- From guess 4, either Q or P is correct and in the correct position. Since P is eliminated, Q is correct and in the third position.\n- From guess 6, either A or G is correct but in the wrong position. Since G is eliminated, A is correct and should be in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the password is 28QA.\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"8\", \"Q\", \"A\"] >>>"
