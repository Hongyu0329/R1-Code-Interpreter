    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the four guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 74JY**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 93ZN**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 26MU**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 57FS**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From Guess 2, we know that numbers 9 and 3, and letters Z and N are not in the password.\n- From Guess 3, numbers 2 and 6 are too small, so the numbers must be greater than 6.\n- From Guess 1, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 7 is greater than 4, 7 is likely the correct number in the correct position.\n- From Guess 4, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 5 is greater than 7, 5 is likely the correct number but in the wrong position.\n\nThus, the numbers are likely 7 and 5, with 7 in the first position and 5 in the second position.\n\n- From Guess 1, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since J is earlier than Y, J is likely the incorrect letter.\n- From Guess 4, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since F is earlier than S, F is likely the incorrect letter.\n\nThus, the letters are likely S and Y, with S in the third position and Y in the fourth position.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe password is likely 75SY. Let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<< [\"7\", \"5\", \"S\", \"Y\"] >>>"
