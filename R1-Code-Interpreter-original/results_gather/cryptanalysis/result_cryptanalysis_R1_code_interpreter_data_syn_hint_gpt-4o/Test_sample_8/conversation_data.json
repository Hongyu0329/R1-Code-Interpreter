    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses.\n\n### Analyzing the Feedback:\n\n1. **Guess: 97EJ**\n   - Both numbers (9 and 7) are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter (E or J) is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter (E or J) is incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 43OM**\n   - Both numbers (4 and 3) are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (O and M) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 20BQ**\n   - One number (2 or 0) is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number (2 or 0) is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter (B or Q) is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter (B or Q) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From the first two guesses, we know that the numbers must be less than 3, since 4, 3, 9, and 7 are all too large.\n- From the third guess, one of the numbers 2 or 0 is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect and too large. Since both 2 and 0 are less than 3, the incorrect number must be 2, and 0 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- Therefore, the numbers are 1 and 0.\n\n- From the first guess, one of the letters E or J is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect.\n- From the second guess, both letters O and M are incorrect and too late in the alphabet, so the correct letter from the first guess must be E or J.\n- From the third guess, one of the letters B or Q is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n- Since E or J is correct from the first guess, and B or Q is correct from the third guess, the correct letters must be E and B, with E in the wrong position in the first guess and B in the wrong position in the third guess.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The numbers are 1 and 0, with 0 in the first position.\n- The letters are E and B, with E in the second position.\n\nThus, the correct password is 01BE.\n\n<<< [\"0\", \"1\", \"B\", \"E\"] >>>"
