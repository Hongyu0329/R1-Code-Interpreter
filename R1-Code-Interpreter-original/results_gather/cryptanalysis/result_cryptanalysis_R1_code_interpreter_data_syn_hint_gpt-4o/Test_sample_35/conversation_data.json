    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 14LZ**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions; both letters are incorrect.\n   - This means the numbers are 1 and 4, but not in the order 1-4. The letters L and Z are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 28EP**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - This means neither 2 nor 8 is in the password. One of the letters E or P is correct and in the correct position. The incorrect letter is too early in the alphabet, meaning it should be a letter that comes after it in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 14RW**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions; both letters are incorrect.\n   - This confirms that the numbers are 1 and 4, but not in the order 1-4. The letters R and W are not in the password.\n\n4. **Guess: 70XH**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - This means neither 7 nor 0 is in the password. One of the letters X or H is correct and in the correct position. The incorrect letter is too early in the alphabet, meaning it should be a letter that comes after it in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- The numbers are 1 and 4, but the order is not 1-4. Therefore, the order must be 4-1.\n- From the second and fourth guesses, we know that one of the letters E or P and one of the letters X or H is correct and in the correct position.\n- Since E and X are in the same position in their respective guesses, and P and H are in the same position, we can deduce that E and X are the correct letters, with E being in the first letter position and X in the second letter position.\n\nThus, the password is 4, 1, E, X.\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"1\", \"E\", \"X\"] >>>"
