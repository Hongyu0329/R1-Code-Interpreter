    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 79EQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large: Possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Possible letters are A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n2. **Guess: 37TK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: Possible letters are A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J.\n\n3. **Guess: 25EO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Possible numbers are 0, 1, 4, 6.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Possible letters are A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J.\n\n4. **Guess: 86LZ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: Possible numbers are 0, 1, 4, 6.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large: The incorrect number is 8, so possible numbers are 0, 1, 4.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: Possible letters are A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J.\n\n5. **Guess: 43WQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Possible numbers are 0, 1.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: Possible letters are A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J.\n\n6. **Guess: 31AO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Possible numbers are 0, 4.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: A or O is correct.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet: O is incorrect, so A is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n7. **Guess: 89GW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large: Possible numbers are 0, 4.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: G is correct.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet: W is incorrect.\n\nFrom the above deductions:\n- The numbers are 0 and 4.\n- The letters are A and G, with G in the correct position in the second letter slot.\n\nThus, the password is 04GA.\n\n<<< [\"0\", \"4\", \"G\", \"A\"] >>>"
