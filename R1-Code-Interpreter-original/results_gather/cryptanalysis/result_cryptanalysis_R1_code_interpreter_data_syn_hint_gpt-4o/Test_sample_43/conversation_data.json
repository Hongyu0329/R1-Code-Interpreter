    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 61OJ** - Both numbers and letters are incorrect. Numbers 6 and 1, and letters O and J are not in the password.\n2. **Guess: 98QN** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large. Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means either 9 or 8 is correct, and the correct number is in the correct position. Letters Q and N are not in the password.\n3. **Guess: 58FC** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect. Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means either 5 or 8 is correct, and the correct number is in the correct position. Letters F and C are not in the password.\n4. **Guess: 72YK** - Both numbers and letters are incorrect. Numbers 7 and 2, and letters Y and K are not in the password.\n5. **Guess: 02ER** - Both numbers are incorrect and too small. Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Numbers 0 and 2 are not in the password. Letters E and R are not in the password.\n6. **Guess: 35QW** - One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect. Both letters are incorrect. This means either 3 or 5 is correct, and the correct number is in the correct position. Letters Q and W are not in the password.\n7. **Guess: 71KJ** - Both numbers are incorrect. Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Numbers 7 and 1 are not in the password. Letters K and J are not in the password.\n8. **Guess: 79PX** - Both numbers are incorrect. One letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Numbers 7 and 9 are not in the password. Letter P is correct and in the correct position, and X is incorrect.\n9. **Guess: 86TV** - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect. One letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect. This means either 8 or 6 is correct, but the correct number is in the wrong position. Letter T is correct and in the correct position, and V is incorrect.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n- The correct numbers are 5 and 8, with 5 in the first position and 8 in the second position.\n- The correct letters are P and T, with P in the third position and T in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the password is 58PT.\n\n<<< [\"5\", \"8\", \"P\", \"T\"] >>>"
