    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from each guess. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 08VY**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Either '0' or '8' is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number is too large, so it must be greater than the correct number.\n   - Both 'V' and 'Y' are incorrect and too late, so the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 07CX**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Either '0' or '7' is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number is too large, so it must be greater than the correct number.\n   - Both 'C' and 'X' are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 45NJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Both '4' and '5' are too large, so the correct numbers are less than these.\n   - Either 'N' or 'J' is correct and in the correct position.\n\n4. **Guess: 28YQ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Either '2' or '8' is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other number is too large, so it must be greater than the correct number.\n   - Either 'Y' or 'Q' is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other letter is too late, so it must be later in the alphabet.\n\nNow, let's deduce the correct combination:\n\n- From conditions 1 and 2, '0' is the only number that appears in both guesses and is correct and in the correct position. Therefore, '0' is the first number.\n- From condition 3, both '4' and '5' are too large, so the second number must be less than '4'. From condition 4, '2' is correct but in the wrong position, so '2' is the second number.\n- From condition 3, either 'N' or 'J' is correct and in the correct position. From condition 4, 'Y' is correct but in the wrong position, and 'Q' is too late. Therefore, 'N' is the correct letter in the third position.\n- From condition 1, both 'V' and 'Y' are too late, and from condition 2, both 'C' and 'X' are incorrect. From condition 4, 'Y' is correct but in the wrong position, so 'Y' is the fourth letter.\n\nThus, the correct combination is:\n\n<<< [\"0\", \"2\", \"N\", \"Y\"] >>>"
