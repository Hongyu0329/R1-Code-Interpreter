    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 10 (48QW), both numbers are correct and in the correct positions. Therefore, the numbers are 4 and 8.\n   - From guess 5 (86YC), one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 8 is in the correct position in guess 10, 6 must be incorrect, confirming 4 and 8 are correct.\n   - From guess 9 (54WB), one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 4 is in the correct position in guess 10, 5 must be incorrect, confirming 4 and 8 are correct.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 10 (48QW), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (86YC), one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since Y is correct, C is incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (87ZL), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11 (86UT), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 6 (91MS), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 1 (75QG), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 2 (30KJ), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 3 (97KP), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 4 (16KA), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7 (31WR), both letters are incorrect.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the letters must be later in the alphabet than Y, and since Y is correct in guess 5, the other letter must be Z. \n\nThus, the correct combination is 4, 8, Y, Z.\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"8\", \"Y\", \"Z\"] >>>"
