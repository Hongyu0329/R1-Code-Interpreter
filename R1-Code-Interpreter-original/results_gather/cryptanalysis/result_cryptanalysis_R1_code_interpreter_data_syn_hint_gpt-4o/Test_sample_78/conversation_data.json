    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 14HF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 38FX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 52YF**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 32QI**\n   - Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 71DX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Deduction Process:\n\n- From Guess 1, both numbers 1 and 4 are incorrect. One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect.\n- From Guess 2, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Both letters F and X are incorrect.\n- From Guess 3, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Both letters Y and F are incorrect.\n- From Guess 4, both numbers 3 and 2 are correct but in the wrong positions. Both letters Q and I are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n- From Guess 5, both numbers 7 and 1 are incorrect. One letter D is correct and in the correct position, and one letter X is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The correct numbers are 2 and 3, but they need to be swapped based on Guess 4.\n- The correct letter D is in the correct position based on Guess 5.\n- The other letter must be earlier in the alphabet than Q, I, and X, and it is not H, F, Y, Q, I, or X. The only possibility is A.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 23DA.\n\nLet's format the answer:\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"3\", \"D\", \"A\"] >>>"
