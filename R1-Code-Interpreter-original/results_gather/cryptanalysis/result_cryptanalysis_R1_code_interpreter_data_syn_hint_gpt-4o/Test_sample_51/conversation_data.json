    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 52FR**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 02IT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 37AO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 17FJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 79NP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 91CK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n7. **Guess: 56SM**\n   - Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n8. **Guess: 76BJ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n9. **Guess: 31RG**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n10. **Guess: 94AV**\n    - Both numbers are incorrect.\n    - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Deduction Process:\n\n- From guesses 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9, we know that the numbers must be greater than 3 and less than 9.\n- From guess 7, we know the numbers are 5 and 6, but in the wrong positions.\n- From guess 5, we know one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early. Since N and P are too early, the correct letter must be V from guess 10.\n- From guess 10, V is in the correct position, and A is incorrect and too early, so the other letter must be later than A.\n- From guess 1, both letters are incorrect, so F and R are not in the password.\n- From guess 8, both letters are incorrect and too early, so B and J are not in the password.\n- From guess 6, both letters are incorrect and too early, so C and K are not in the password.\n\nThe only letter that fits all these conditions is V and W (since W is later than A and not mentioned in any incorrect guesses).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The numbers are 6 and 5.\n- The letters are V and W.\n\nLet's determine the correct order:\n\n- From guess 7, 56 is the wrong order, so the correct order is 65.\n- From guess 10, V is in the correct position, so the order is 65VW.\n\nThus, the password is 65VW.\n\n<<< [\"6\", \"5\", \"V\", \"W\"] >>>"
