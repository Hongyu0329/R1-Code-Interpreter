    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from each guess. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 35WJ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 67VX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 37QK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 75GT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 34QE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 27CU**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 56FA**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n8. **Guess: 84YT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n### Deduction Process:\n\n- From guess 2, numbers 6 and 7 and letters V and X are incorrect.\n- From guess 6, numbers 2 and 7 and letters C and U are incorrect.\n- From guess 5, numbers 3 and 4 are too small.\n- From guess 1, number 5 is correct and in the correct position, and letters W and J are incorrect.\n- From guess 4, number 5 is correct and in the correct position, and letters G and T are incorrect.\n- From guess 7, number 5 is correct but in the wrong position, and letters F and A are incorrect.\n- From guess 8, number 8 is correct and in the correct position, and letter Y is correct and in the correct position.\n\nFrom the above deductions, the numbers 5 and 8 are correct, with 8 in the first position. The letters Y is correct and in the correct position.\n\nNow, let's determine the second number and the second letter:\n\n- From guess 1, number 5 is in the second position.\n- From guess 8, number 4 is too small, so the second number must be 9.\n- From guess 3, letter Q is incorrect, so the second letter must be K.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 89YK.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking all conditions:\n\n- 89YK:\n  - Condition 1: 8 is correct and in the correct position, 9 is incorrect and too small, both letters are incorrect.\n  - Condition 2: Both numbers are incorrect, both letters are incorrect.\n  - Condition 3: Both numbers are incorrect, Y is correct and in the correct position, K is incorrect and incorrect.\n  - Condition 4: 8 is correct and in the correct position, 9 is incorrect and incorrect, both letters are incorrect.\n  - Condition 5: Both numbers are incorrect and too small, both letters are incorrect.\n  - Condition 6: Both numbers are incorrect, both letters are incorrect.\n  - Condition 7: 8 is correct but in the wrong position, 9 is incorrect and incorrect, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n  - Condition 8: 8 is correct and in the correct position, 9 is incorrect and too small, Y is correct and in the correct position, K is incorrect and incorrect.\n\nThe correct combination is 89YK.\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"9\", \"Y\", \"K\"] >>>"
