    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 41CK**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 64DE**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 87JY**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 12OD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From Guess 3, numbers 8 and 7, and letters J and Y are incorrect.\n- From Guess 4, numbers 1 and 2 are too small.\n- From Guess 1, number 4 is correct and in the correct position, and number 1 is incorrect and too small, so the other number must be greater than 4.\n- From Guess 2, number 6 is correct but in the wrong position, and number 4 is incorrect in this position, confirming 4 is the first number.\n- From Guess 1, letter C is correct but in the wrong position, and letter K is incorrect and too early, so the correct letter must be later in the alphabet than K.\n- From Guess 4, letter O is correct but in the wrong position, and letter D is incorrect and too early, so the correct letter must be later in the alphabet than D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The first number is 4.\n- The second number is 6 (from Guess 2, 6 is correct but in the wrong position).\n- The correct letters are C and O, with C in the second position and O in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 46CO.\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"6\", \"C\", \"O\"] >>>"
