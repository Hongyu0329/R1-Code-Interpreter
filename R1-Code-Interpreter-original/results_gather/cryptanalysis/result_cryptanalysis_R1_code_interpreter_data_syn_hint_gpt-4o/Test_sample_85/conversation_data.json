    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the 13 guesses. Let's analyze the feedback step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, we know that the numbers 8, 6, 9, 3, 1, 5, 0, and 7 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, we know that one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is incorrect, 2 must be correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 6, we know that one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and incorrect. Since 2 is correct and in the correct position, 3 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 11, we know that one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and incorrect. Since 4 is incorrect, 7 is incorrect, and 0 is incorrect, the correct number must be 2.\n   - From guess 9, we know that one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 7 is incorrect, 8 is incorrect, and 9 is incorrect, the correct number must be 4.\n   - Therefore, the numbers are 2 and 4.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12, we know that the letters A, F, L, X, K, T, M, J, V, Q, I, C, O, and E are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, we know that one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. Since W is correct and in the correct position, K is incorrect.\n   - From guess 13, we know that one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. Since D is incorrect, W is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - Therefore, the letters are W and D.\n\nCombining the numbers and letters, the correct combination is 2, 4, W, and D. Let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"4\", \"W\", \"D\"] >>>"
