    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 14VM**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 91UE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 85FO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 05QJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 85ZQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 95WT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n7. **Guess: 57KR**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n### Deduction Process:\n\n- From guess 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, we know that the numbers 9, 1, 8, 5, 7, and 0 are incorrect. This leaves us with the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 6 as possibilities.\n- From guess 1, since one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small, the correct number must be 4 (since 1 is too small).\n- From guess 4, since both numbers are incorrect, 0 and 5 are not part of the combination.\n- From guess 1, both letters V and M are incorrect.\n- From guess 2, both letters U and E are incorrect.\n- From guess 3, both letters F and O are incorrect.\n- From guess 4, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect. Since Q is incorrect in guess 5, J must be the correct letter but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 6, both letters W and T are incorrect and too late in the alphabet, so the letters must be earlier than W and T.\n- From guess 7, both letters K and R are incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The correct numbers are 4 and 6 (since 4 is in the correct position in guess 1, and 6 is the only remaining number).\n- The correct letters are J and a letter earlier than W, T, K, and R. Since J is correct but in the wrong position in guess 4, it must be the second letter.\n- The only letter left that is earlier than W, T, K, and R and not used in any incorrect guesses is A.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 4, 6, A, J.\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"6\", \"A\", \"J\"] >>>"
