    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the two guesses.\n\n### Analyzing the Feedback:\n\n1. **First Guess: 87ID**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - One of the numbers 8 or 7 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other number (either 8 or 7) is incorrect and too large.\n   - One of the letters I or D is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other letter (either I or D) is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Second Guess: 50FH**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Both numbers 5 and 0 are incorrect and too small.\n   - One of the letters F or H is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other letter (either F or H) is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From the first guess, since one number is too large, and from the second guess, both numbers are too small, the correct numbers must be between 5 and 8.\n- From the first guess, one letter is too early in the alphabet, and from the second guess, one letter is too early in the alphabet, the correct letters must be later in the alphabet than I and F.\n\n### Possible Numbers:\n- The numbers must be 6 and 7, as 8 is too large and 5 is too small.\n\n### Possible Letters:\n- The letters must be J and H, as I and F are too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Arranging the Numbers and Letters:\n- From the feedback, we know that the correct numbers and letters are in the wrong positions in the guesses. We need to arrange them correctly.\n\nLet's try to deduce the correct order:\n\n- Since 7 is in the wrong position in the first guess, it should be in the first position.\n- Since 6 is the only other number, it should be in the second position.\n- Since H is in the wrong position in the second guess, it should be in the third position.\n- Since J is the only other letter, it should be in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 76HJ.\n\n<<< [\"7\", \"6\", \"H\", \"J\"] >>>"
