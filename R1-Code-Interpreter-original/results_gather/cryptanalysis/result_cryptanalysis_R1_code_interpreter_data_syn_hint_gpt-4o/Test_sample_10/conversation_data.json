    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. **Guess: 25KS**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 26BP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 39ON**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Analyzing the Numbers:\n- From Guess 1 and 2, numbers 2, 5, and 6 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 3, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This means:\n  - Number 3 is incorrect and too small.\n  - Number 9 is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nThus, the numbers must be 9 and a number greater than 3 that is not 2, 5, or 6. The only possibilities are 7 and 8. Since 9 is in the wrong position in Guess 3, it must be the first number.\n\n### Analyzing the Letters:\n- From Guess 1, letters K and S are incorrect.\n- From Guess 2, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. This means:\n  - Letter B is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n  - Letter P is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n- From Guess 3, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. This means:\n  - Letter O is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n  - Letter N is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nThus, the letters must be P and N, with P in the second position and N in the first position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct combination is 9, 8, N, P.\n\nLet's format the answer:\n\n<<< [\"9\", \"8\", \"N\", \"P\"] >>>"
