    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 49EK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 03KE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 05OP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 28JC**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 98XJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 37XW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are correct but in the wrong positions.\n\n### Deduction:\n\n- From guesses 1, 2, and 3, we know that the numbers 0, 3, 4, 5, 9 are incorrect. \n- From guess 4, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 8 is too large, the correct number must be 2, but it is in the wrong position.\n- From guess 5, both numbers 9 and 8 are incorrect and too large, confirming that the numbers must be smaller than 8.\n- From guess 6, both numbers 3 and 7 are incorrect, leaving us with the numbers 1 and 6 as possibilities. Since 2 is correct but in the wrong position in guess 4, the numbers must be 2 and 1.\n\n- For the letters:\n  - From guesses 1, 2, 3, and 4, the letters E, K, O, P, J, and C are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n  - From guess 5, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since J is too early, X is correct but in the wrong position.\n  - From guess 6, both letters X and W are correct but in the wrong positions.\n\nThus, the correct letters are W and X, but they need to be swapped from their positions in guess 6.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correct combination is:\n- Numbers: 2 and 1\n- Letters: W and X\n\nTherefore, the password is 21WX.\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"1\", \"W\", \"X\"] >>>"
