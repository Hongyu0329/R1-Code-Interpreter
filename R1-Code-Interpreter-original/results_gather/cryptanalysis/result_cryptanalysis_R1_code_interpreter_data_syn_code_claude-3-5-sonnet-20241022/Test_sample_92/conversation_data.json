    "Let me analyze the output and continue reasoning:\n\n1. From the Number Analysis:\n- All guesses with \"one correct position\" contain '2'\n- This strongly suggests that '2' is correct and in the second position\n- When '2' is in first position (in 25SK), it's \"incorrect position\"\n\n2.

For the letters:\nFrom the Letter Analysis:\n- 'AC', 'KL', 'FJ', 'KC', 'ML' are all too early in the alphabet\n- In '02VX': V is correct but wrong position, X is too late\n- This means V must be in the solution but not in the third position\n- The letters must be after 'M' but before 'X'\n\nLet's analyze the letter possibilities:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_letters():\n    alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    too_early = set('ABCDEFGHIJKLM')  # Letters before N are too early\n    too_late = set('XYZ')  # X is too late\n    \n    # V must be in the solution but not in third position\n    # Possible positions for V: fourth position\n    \n    possible_letters = set(alphabet) - too_early - too_late\n    print(\"Possible letters (between M and X):\", ''.join(sorted(list(possible_letters))))\n    print(\"V must be in the solution but not in third position\")\n\nanalyze_letters()\n```\n\nFrom all our analysis:\n1. First digit must be 4 (after eliminating all impossibilities)\n2. Second digit is definitely 2\n3. V must be in the solution but in fourth position (not third as in '02VX')\n4. For the other letter position (third), we need a letter between N and W\n5. N is the only letter that satisfies all conditions for the third position\n\nTherefore, the solution must be 42VN:\n- 4 and 2 satisfy all number conditions\n- V and N are between M and X in the alphabet\n- V is in a different position than in '02VX'\n- This combination satisfies all given feedback conditions\n\n<<<[4, 2, \"V\", \"N\"]>>>",
