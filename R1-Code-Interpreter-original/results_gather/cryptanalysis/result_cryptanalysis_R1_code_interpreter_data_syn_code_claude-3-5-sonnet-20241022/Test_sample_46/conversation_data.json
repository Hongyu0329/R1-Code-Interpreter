    "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's analyze what we know about the numbers:\n- From guess 3 (09OQ), we know both numbers are 0 and 9 in correct positions\n- From guess 1 (20BH), one number (either 0 or 2) is correct but wrong position\n- From guesses 2 and 4, all their numbers (8,5,2,8) are incorrect\n\n2) For the letters:\n- From guesses 1 and 2, all letters (B,H,I,M) are too early in alphabet\n- From guess 3, one letter (O or Q) is correct but wrong position\n- From guess 4, one letter is correct but wrong position, and one is too early\n\nLet's write code to systematically check all possibilities:\n\n```python\ndef check_guess(actual, guess, feedback):\n    # Unpack feedback\n    num_correct_pos = sum(1 for i in range(2) if feedback[i] == 'correct_pos')\n    num_correct_wrong_pos = sum(1 for i in range(2) if feedback[i] == 'correct_wrong_pos')\n    num_incorrect = sum(1 for i in range(2) if feedback[i] == 'incorrect')\n    \n    letter_correct_wrong_pos = sum(1 for i in range(2,4) if feedback[i] == 'correct_wrong_pos')\n    letter_too_early = sum(1 for i in range(2,4) if feedback[i] == 'too_early')\n    letter_incorrect = sum(1 for i in range(2,4) if feedback[i] == 'incorrect')\n    \n    # Check numbers\n    correct_pos = sum(1 for i in range(2) if actual[i] == guess[i])\n    correct_wrong_pos = sum(1 for i in range(2) if guess[i] in actual[:2] and actual[i] != guess[i])\n    incorrect = sum(1 for i in range(2) if guess[i] not in actual[:2])\n    \n    if (correct_pos != num_correct_pos or \n        correct_wrong_pos != num_correct_wrong_pos or \n        incorrect != num_incorrect):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check letters\n    l_correct_wrong_pos = sum(1 for i in range(2,4) if guess[i] in actual[2:] and actual[i] != guess[i])\n    l_too_early = sum(1 for i in range(2,4) if ord(guess[i]) < ord(actual[i]))\n    l_incorrect = sum(1 for i in range(2,4) if guess[i] not in actual[2:] and not ord(guess[i]) < ord(actual[i]))\n    \n    return (l_correct_wrong_pos == letter_correct_wrong_pos and \n            l_too_early == letter_too_early and \n            l_incorrect == letter_incorrect)\n\ndef is_valid_password(password):\n    # Check guesses against known conditions\n    guesses = [\n        ('20BH', [('correct_wrong_pos', 'incorrect'), ('too_early', 'too_early')]),\n        ('85IM', [('incorrect', 'incorrect'), ('too_early', 'too_early')]),\n        ('09OQ', [('correct_pos', 'correct_pos'), ('correct_wrong_pos', 'incorrect')]),\n        ('28BR', [('incorrect', 'incorrect'), ('correct_wrong_pos', 'too_early')])\n    ]\n    \n    for guess, feedback in guesses:\n        if not check_guess(password, guess, feedback):\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible combinations\nimport string\nvalid_passwords = []\nnumbers = '0123456789'\nletters = string.ascii_uppercase\n\nfor n1 in '09':  # We know these are correct from guess 3\n    for n2 in '09':\n        if n1 == n2:  # Numbers can't repeat\n            continue\n        for l1 in letters:\n            for l2 in letters:\n                if l1 == l2:  # Letters can't repeat\n                    continue\n                password = [n1, n2, l1, l2]\n                if is_valid_password(password):\n                    valid_passwords.append(password)\n\nprint(valid_passwords)\n```\n\nBased on the code execution, we can find the unique solution that satisfies all conditions.

    "I notice that my code didn't find any solutions. Let me revise my reasoning and code:\n\n1) Let's be more systematic about what we know:\n- From guess 3 (09OQ): \n  * 0 and 9 are in correct positions\n  * Either O or Q is correct but in wrong position\n  \n- From guess 4 (28BR):\n  * One letter (B or R) is correct but in wrong position\n  * One letter is too early in alphabet\n\n- From guess 1 (20BH):\n  * One number is correct but wrong position (but we already know numbers are 09)\n  * Both letters are too early in alphabet\n\n- From guess 2 (85IM):\n  * Both letters are too early in alphabet\n\nLet me write a simpler, more focused code:\n\n```python\ndef test_password(password):\n    # Convert password list to string for easier comparison\n    pwd = ''.join(password)\n    \n    # Guess 3 (09OQ): Both numbers correct, one letter correct but wrong pos\n    if pwd[0:2] != '09':\n        return False\n    if not (('O' in pwd[2:] and pwd.index('O') != pwd.index('O')) or \n            ('Q' in pwd[2:] and pwd.index('Q') != pwd.index('Q'))):\n        return False\n    \n    # Guess 4 (28BR): One letter correct but wrong pos, one too early\n    if not ('R' in pwd[2:] or 'B' in pwd[2:]):\n        return False\n    \n    # Letters must be after B,H,I,M in alphabet\n    if any(l <= 'M' for l in pwd[2:]):\n        return False\n    \n    # Letters can't repeat\n    if pwd[2] == pwd[3]:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# We know numbers are 09\nnumbers = '09'\nvalid_passwords = []\n\n# Try all possible letter combinations\nimport string\nletters = [l for l in string.ascii_uppercase if l > 'M']  # Only letters after M\n\nfor l1 in letters:\n    for l2 in letters:\n        if l1 != l2:  # Letters can't repeat\n            password = ['0', '9', l1, l2]\n            if test_password(password):\n                valid_passwords.append(password)\n\nprint(valid_passwords)\n```\n\nAfter revising my reasoning:\n1. Numbers must be 09 (from guess 3)\n2. Letters must be after M in the alphabet (from guesses 1 and 2)\n3. One letter must be O or Q (from guess 3)\n4. One letter must be R (from guess 4 - it can't be B because B is too early in alphabet)\n5. The letters can't repeat\n\n<<<[\"0\", \"9\", \"O\", \"R\"]>>>\n\nThe answer must be [\"0\", \"9\", \"O\", \"R\"] because:\n1. 09 are confirmed from guess 3\n2. O is confirmed from guess 3 (Q would conflict with other conditions)\n3. R is confirmed from guess 4\n4. Both O and R are after M in the alphabet\n5. This combination satisfies all the feedback conditions from all guesses\n6. The order must be O,R (not R,O) because of the feedback from guesses 3 and 4",
    "I apologize for my previous attempts. Let me revise my reasoning more carefully:\n\n1) From guess 3 (09OQ):\n   * 0,9 are in correct positions\n   * One of O/Q is correct but in wrong position\n   * The other letter is incorrect\n\n2) From guess 4 (28BR):\n   * One letter (B/R) is correct but wrong position\n   * One letter is too early in alphabet\n   * Since B is too early (from other guesses), R must be correct\n\n3) From guesses 1 (20BH) and 2 (85IM):\n   * All these letters (B,H,I,M) are too early in alphabet\n\nLet's write a more precise code:\n\n```python\ndef verify_guess(password):\n    # Guess 3 (09OQ)\n    if password[0] != '0' or password[1] != '9':  # Numbers must be 09\n        return False\n        \n    # From guess 3: One of O/Q must be in password but in wrong position\n    if 'O' in password[2:]:\n        if password.index('O') == 2:  # O can't be in first letter position\n            return False\n    elif 'Q' in password[2:]:\n        if password.index('Q') == 3:  # Q can't be in second letter position\n            return False\n    else:\n        return False\n        \n    # From guess 4: R must be in password but in wrong position\n    if 'R' not in password[2:]:\n        return False\n    if password.index('R') == 3:  # R can't be in second letter position\n        return False\n        \n    # Letters must be after M in alphabet\n    if any(c <= 'M' for c in password[2:]):\n        return False\n        \n    # Letters can't repeat\n    if password[2] == password[3]:\n        return False\n        \n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible combinations\nvalid_passwords = []\nnumbers = '09'\nimport string\nletters = [l for l in string.ascii_uppercase if l > 'M']\n\nfor l1 in letters:\n    for l2 in letters:\n        if l1 != l2:\n            password = ['0', '9', l1, l2]\n            if verify_guess(password):\n                valid_passwords.append(password)\n\nprint(valid_passwords)\n```\n\nAfter this more precise analysis:\n1. Numbers are 09 (from guess 3)\n2. One letter must be O or Q, but not in the position shown in guess 3\n3. R must be present but not in the position shown in guess 4\n4. Both letters must be after M\n5. The letters can't repeat\n\n<<<[\"0\", \"9\", \"Q\", \"R\"]>>>\n\nThis must be the answer because:\n1. 09 are confirmed from guess 3\n2. Q must be the first letter (from guess 3's feedback that one letter is correct but wrong position)\n3. R must be the second letter (from guess 4's feedback)\n4. Both Q and R are after M in the alphabet\n5. This combination satisfies all feedback conditions:\n   - Guess 1 (20BH): Both letters too early (true for Q,R)\n   - Guess 2 (85IM): Both letters too early (true for Q,R)\n   - Guess 3 (09OQ): Numbers correct, Q in wrong position\n   - Guess 4 (28BR): R in wrong position, B too early",
    "Ah, I see! The code has found the correct answer, and I was wrong in my final interpretation. Let me explain why [\"0\", \"9\", \"R\", \"O\"] is indeed the correct answer:\n\n1.
