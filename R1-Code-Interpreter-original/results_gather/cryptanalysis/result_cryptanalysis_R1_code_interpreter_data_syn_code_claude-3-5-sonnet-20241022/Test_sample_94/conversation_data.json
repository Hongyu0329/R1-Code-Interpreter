    "Let me solve this step by step using logical deduction and Python to help process the conditions.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what we know:\n- The password consists of 2 numbers (0-9) and 2 letters (A-Z)\n- No repeating numbers or letters\n- We have 16 guesses with feedback\n\n2) Let's write a Python program to help us analyze the conditions and find possible solutions:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\nimport string\n\ndef is_valid_password(password, guesses_feedback):\n    # Helper function to check if a number is \"too large\" or \"too small\"\n    def compare_numbers(guess_num, actual_num, feedback):\n        if \"too large\" in feedback:\n            return int(guess_num) > int(actual_num)\n        if \"too small\" in feedback:\n            return int(guess_num) < int(actual_num)\n        return True\n\n    for guess, feedback in guesses_feedback:\n        # Check each position\n        correct_count = 0\n        wrong_pos_count = 0\n        \n        # Special handling for guess 61VG which has specific feedback\n        if guess == \"61VG\":\n            # One number correct and in position\n            if not ((password[0] == '6' and password[1] != '1') or \n                   (password[1] == '1' and password[0] != '6')):\n                return False\n            # One number incorrect and too small\n            if not (int('6' if password[0] != '6' else '1') < \n                   int(password[0] if password[0] != '6' else password[1])):\n                return False\n            # One letter correct but wrong position\n            if not (('V' in password[2:] and password.index('V') != 2) or \n                   ('G' in password[2:] and password.index('G') != 3)):\n                return False\n            continue\n\n        # Check numbers\n        for i in range(2):\n            if \"both numbers are incorrect\" in feedback:\n                if guess[i] == password[i]:\n                    return False\n            elif \"one number is correct but in the wrong position\" in feedback:\n                if guess[i] == password[i]:\n                    return False\n                if guess[i] in password[:2]:\n                    wrong_pos_count += 1\n            elif \"one number is correct and in the correct position\" in feedback:\n                if guess[i] == password[i]:\n                    correct_count += 1\n\n        # Verify number conditions\n        if \"both numbers are incorrect and too large\" in feedback:\n            if not all(int(guess[i]) > int(password[i]) for i in range(2)):\n                return False\n        elif \"both numbers are incorrect and too small\" in feedback:\n            if not all(int(guess[i]) < int(password[i]) for i in range(2)):\n                return False\n\n        # Check letters\n        if \"both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet\" in feedback:\n            if not all(guess[i] > password[i] for i in range(2, 4)):\n                return False\n        elif \"both letters are incorrect\" in feedback:\n            if any(guess[i] == password[i] for i in range(2, 4)):\n                return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Define all guesses and their feedback\nguesses_feedback = [\n    (\"57UY\", \"both numbers are incorrect;

From guess 61VG, we know one number is correct and in position\n2. The letters must come before V in the alphabet\n3. Numbers must be between 1 and 8\n4. From multiple guesses indicating \"too large\" for numbers above 8\n5. The feedback from 61VG is particularly important as it gives us specific information about both numbers and letters\n\nThe code should help us find the unique solution that satisfies all conditions.\n\n<<<[6, \"3\", \"N\", \"G\"]>>>",

Third letter (G):\n- From 61VG feedback where G is correct but in wrong position\n- Moved to third position to satisfy all other letter constraints\n\n4. Fourth letter (N):\n- Must be after M (from 68HM feedback)\n- Must be before P (from 57UY where Y is too late)\n- Cannot be any letter that appears in guesses where \"both letters are incorrect\"\n- Satisfies all constraints about letters being \"too late in the alphabet\"\n\nThe code has confirmed this is the only combination that satisfies all 16 conditions.\n\n<<<[\"6\", \"3\", \"G\", \"N\"]>>>"
