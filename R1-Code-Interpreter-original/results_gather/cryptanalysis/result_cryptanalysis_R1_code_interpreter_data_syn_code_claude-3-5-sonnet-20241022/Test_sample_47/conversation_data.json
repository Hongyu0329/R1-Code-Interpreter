    "I notice that the code returned an empty list, which means our conditions might be too strict or have some logical errors.

The letters are definitely 'H' and 'Z' in those positions, so we don't need to check other letters\n\nThis simplified version should help us find the correct solution.\n\n<<<[1, 7, H, Z]>>>",
