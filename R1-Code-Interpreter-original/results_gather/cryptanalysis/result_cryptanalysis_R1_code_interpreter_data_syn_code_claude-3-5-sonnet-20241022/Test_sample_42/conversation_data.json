    "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's analyze what we know about the numbers:\n- From guesses 1,2,3: 0,3,4,5,9 are not the numbers\n- From guess 4: 8 is too large, and 2 is correct but in wrong position\n- From guess 5: 9,8 are too large\n- From guess 6: 3,7 are not the numbers\n\n2) For the letters:\n- From guesses 1,2,3: E,K,O,P are too early in alphabet\n- From guess 4: J,C are too early in alphabet\n- From guess 5: X is correct but wrong position, J is too early\n- From guess 6: X,W are both correct but wrong positions\n\n3) Let's write code to systematically find all possibilities:\n\n```python\ndef check_conditions(nums, letters):\n    # Convert to list for easier position checking\n    guess = [str(nums[0]), str(nums[1]), letters[0], letters[1]]\n    \n    # Condition 4: 28JC - one number correct but wrong position, 8 too large\n    if 8 in nums: return False\n    if 2 not in nums: return False\n    if guess.index(str(2)) == 0: return False  # 2 must be in second position\n    \n    # Condition 5: 98XJ - X in wrong position, both numbers too large\n    if 9 in nums or 8 in nums: return False\n    if 'X' not in letters: return False\n    \n    # Condition 6: 37XW - both X and W must be present but in opposite positions\n    if 'X' not in letters or 'W' not in letters: return False\n    \n    # Letters that are too early in alphabet\n    early_letters = set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP')\n    if any(l in early_letters for l in letters): return False\n    \n    # Numbers that are known to be incorrect\n    wrong_nums = {0,3,4,5,7,9}\n    if any(n in wrong_nums for n in nums): return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible combinations\nvalid_solutions = []\nfor n1 in range(10):\n    for n2 in range(10):\n        if n1 == n2: continue\n        for l1 in 'QRSTUVWXYZ':\n            for l2 in 'QRSTUVWXYZ':\n                if l1 == l2: continue\n                if check_conditions([n1,n2], [l1,l2]):\n                    valid_solutions.append([n1,n2,l1,l2])\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nFrom the code execution, we can analyze:\n1) The numbers must include 2, and it must be in the second position\n2) The other number must be less than 8 and not in the excluded set\n3) The letters must be X and W, and they must be in opposite positions from [X,W]\n4) All letters before P in the alphabet are excluded\n\nLooking at the conditions:\n- The numbers must be [1,2] or [6,2] since 2 must be second position\n- The letters must be X and W in some order\n- Given the conditions from guesses 5 and 6, W must be before X\n\nTherefore:\n\n<<<[1, 2, \"W\", \"X\"]>>>",
    "Let me analyze the code output further:\n\nWe got four possible combinations: \n[1, 2, 'W', 'X']\n[1, 2, 'X', 'W']\n[6, 2, 'W', 'X']\n[6, 2, 'X', 'W']\n\nLet's look at conditions 5 and 6 more carefully:\n- From guess 5 (98XJ): X is in wrong position\n- From guess 6 (37XW): both X and W are in wrong positions\n\nLet's write more specific code to check these position constraints:\n\n```python\ndef check_letter_positions(solution):\n    # Get positions of X and W in the solution\n    x_pos = solution.index('X')\n    w_pos = solution.index('W')\n    \n    # From guess 5 (98XJ): X cannot be in position 2\n    if x_pos == 2:\n        return False\n        \n    # From guess 6 (37XW): \n    # If X is in position 3, it's in same position as guess 6 (wrong)\n    # If W is in position 3, it's in same position as guess 6 (wrong)\n    if x_pos == 3 or w_pos == 3:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\nsolutions = [[1, 2, 'W', 'X'], [1, 2, 'X', 'W'], [6, 2, 'W', 'X'], [6, 2, 'X', 'W']]\nvalid = []\nfor sol in solutions:\n    if check_letter_positions(sol):\n        valid.append(sol)\n        \nprint(valid)\n```\n\nFrom this additional constraint checking:\n1) X cannot be in position 2 (from guess 5)\n2) Neither X nor W can be in position 3 (from guess 6)\n3) This means X must be in position 3 and W must be in position 2\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n- We know 2 is in position 1\n- Between 1 and 6, we need to consider which one fits all conditions\n- From guess 4 (28JC), we know 2 is in wrong position when in position 0\n- Therefore, the first number must be 1\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[1, 2, \"W\", \"X\"]>>>",
