The key insights from the feedback:\n\n1. From guess #4 (06GE), we know one number and one letter are correct and in position\n2. From guess #8 (15IG), we know G is in the password but in wrong position\n3.

    "I notice we still have two possible solutions: [0,3,G,C] and [0,9,G,C].

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please deduce the correct password based on the following 10 known conditions:\nA certain combination lock consists of two numbers and two letters, with neither the numbers nor the letters repeating.\n1. Guess: 15NT, Feedback: both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n2. Guess: 21OD, Feedback: both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n3. Guess: 51BI, Feedback: both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n4. Guess: 06GE, Feedback: one number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n5. Guess: 32FY, Feedback: both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n6. Guess: 13UN, Feedback: both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n7. Guess: 37DU, Feedback: both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n8. Guess: 15IG, Feedback: both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n9. Guess: 25IA, Feedback: both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n10. Guess: 93PA, Feedback: one number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\nPlease provide your answer in the format <<< [\"X\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"W\"] >>> where X and Y are the numbers and Z and W are the letters of the password.",
