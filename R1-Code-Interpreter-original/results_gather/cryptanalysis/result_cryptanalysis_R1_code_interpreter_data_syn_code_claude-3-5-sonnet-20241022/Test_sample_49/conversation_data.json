    "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's analyze what we know about the numbers:\n   - From guess 6 (54ZF), we know the numbers are exactly 54\n   - This is confirmed by other guesses:\n     - Guess 1 (75KB): one number correct but wrong position (5)\n     - Guess 2 (15UA): one number correct but wrong position (5)\n     - Guess 4 (05PB): one number correct but wrong position (5)\n     - Guess 3 (09KJ): both numbers wrong\n     - Guess 5 (69DB): both numbers too large\n\n2) For the letters:\n   - From guess 2 (15UA), we know both U and A are correct and in correct positions\n   - This is confirmed by other guesses:\n     - Guess 1 (75KB): both letters wrong\n     - Guess 3 (09KJ): both letters wrong\n     - Guess 4 (05PB): both letters wrong\n     - Guess 5 (69DB): both letters wrong\n     - Guess 6 (54ZF): both letters wrong\n\nLet me verify this with code:\n\n```python\ndef verify_guess(actual, guess, feedback):\n    # Unpack the feedback\n    num_correct = feedback['numbers_correct']\n    num_wrong_pos = feedback['numbers_wrong_pos']\n    num_too_large = feedback['numbers_too_large']\n    num_too_small = feedback['numbers_too_small']\n    letters_correct = feedback['letters_correct']\n    \n    # Check numbers\n    correct_pos = 0\n    wrong_pos = 0\n    too_large = 0\n    too_small = 0\n    \n    for i in range(2):\n        if guess[i] == actual[i]:\n            correct_pos += 1\n        elif guess[i] in actual[:2]:\n            wrong_pos += 1\n        elif int(guess[i]) > int(actual[i]):\n            too_large += 1\n        else:\n            too_small += 1\n    \n    # Check letters\n    letters_match = sum(1 for i in range(2,4) if guess[i] == actual[i])\n    \n    # Verify all conditions\n    conditions_met = (\n        (num_correct == correct_pos) and\n        (num_wrong_pos == wrong_pos) and\n        (num_too_large == too_large) and\n        (num_too_small == too_small) and\n        (letters_correct == letters_match)\n    )\n    \n    return conditions_met\n\n# The proposed solution\nsolution = ['5', '4', 'U', 'A']\n\n# All the guesses and their feedback\nguesses = [\n    {\n        'guess': ['7', '5', 'K', 'B'],\n        'feedback': {\n            'numbers_correct': 0,\n            'numbers_wrong_pos': 1,\n            'numbers_too_large': 1,\n            'numbers_too_small': 0,\n            'letters_correct': 0\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        'guess': ['1', '5', 'U', 'A'],\n        'feedback': {\n            'numbers_correct': 0,\n            'numbers_wrong_pos': 1,\n            'numbers_too_small': 1,\n            'numbers_too_large': 0,\n            'letters_correct': 2\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        'guess': ['0', '9', 'K', 'J'],\n        'feedback': {\n            'numbers_correct': 0,\n            'numbers_wrong_pos': 0,\n            'numbers_too_large': 0,\n            'numbers_too_small': 0,\n            'letters_correct': 0\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        'guess': ['0', '5', 'P', 'B'],\n        'feedback': {\n            'numbers_correct': 0,\n            'numbers_wrong_pos': 1,\n            'numbers_too_small': 1,\n            'numbers_too_large': 0,\n            'letters_correct': 0\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        'guess': ['6', '9', 'D', 'B'],\n        'feedback': {\n            'numbers_correct': 0,\n            'numbers_wrong_pos': 0,\n            'numbers_too_large': 2,\n            'numbers_too_small': 0,\n            'letters_correct': 0\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        'guess': ['5', '4', 'Z', 'F'],\n        'feedback': {\n            'numbers_correct': 2,\n            'numbers_wrong_pos': 0,\n            'numbers_too_large': 0,\n            'numbers_too_small': 0,\n            'letters_correct': 0\n        }\n    }\n]\n\n# Verify the solution against all guesses\nall_correct = all(verify_guess(solution, g['guess'], g['feedback']) for g in guesses)\nprint(f\"Solution {solution} is {'correct' if all_correct else 'incorrect'} according to all conditions\")\n```\n\nBased on the code verification and our logical deduction:\n1.

    "I apologize for the error. Let me revise my analysis:\n\n1) For numbers:\n   - From guess 6 (54ZF): both numbers correct and in position → 54 is confirmed\n   - This matches with other guesses:\n     - Guess 1 (75KB): one number correct but wrong position (5)\n     - Guess 2 (15UA): one number correct but wrong position (5)\n     - Guess 4 (05PB): one number correct but wrong position (5)\n     - Guess 3 (09KJ): both numbers wrong\n     - Guess 5 (69DB): both numbers too large\n\n2) I made a mistake about the letters.
