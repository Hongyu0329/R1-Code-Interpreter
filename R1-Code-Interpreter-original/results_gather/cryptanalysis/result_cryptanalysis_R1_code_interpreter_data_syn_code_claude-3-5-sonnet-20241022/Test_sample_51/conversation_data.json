From condition 7, we know the numbers are 5 and 6 (in some order)\n2. From condition 5, we know one of the letters (N or P) is in the password but in wrong position\n3. From condition 10, we know one of the letters (V) is in the correct position\n4. Multiple conditions indicate that certain letters are too early in the alphabet\n\nThe Python script will help us find the exact combination that satisfies all conditions.\n\nAfter running the code and analyzing the output, we can determine the password.\n\n<<<[\"6\", \"5\", \"V\", \"N\"]>>>",

The numbers are 5 and 6 (from condition 7)\n2. One of the letters must be V in its correct position (from condition 10)\n3. One of N or P must be in the password but in wrong position (from condition 5)\n4. Many letters are eliminated for being \"too early in the alphabet\"\n\nAfter running this refined code and analyzing the conditions more carefully:\n\n<<<[\"6\", \"5\", \"V\", \"N\"]>>>\n\nThe solution makes sense because:\n1. The numbers 6 and 5 satisfy all number-related conditions\n2. V is in the correct position (condition 10)\n3. N is the other letter, which appears in wrong position in condition 5\n4. This combination doesn't violate any of the \"too early in alphabet\" conditions\n5. All other conditions are satisfied with this combination",

From condition 10, we know V must be in the correct position, and since it appears as the second letter in the guess (94AV), it must be in the second letter position\n2. From condition 5 (79NP), we know N must be the other letter because:\n   - If P was in the password, it would conflict with other conditions\n   - N appears in multiple conditions and fits the pattern of being in the wrong position\n3. The numbers must be 6 and 5 in that order because:\n   - Condition 8 (76BJ) shows 6 is in wrong position when it's second\n   - Condition 1 (52FR) shows 5 must be in wrong position when it's first\n\nTherefore, the only solution that satisfies all conditions is:\n\n<<<[\"6\", \"5\", \"V\", \"N\"]>>>",
