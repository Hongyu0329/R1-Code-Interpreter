    "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's write code to help us analyze the conditions and find patterns:\n\n```python\ndef check_conditions(guess):\n    # Define all conditions\n    conditions = [\n        # 61OJ - both numbers wrong, letters too early\n        lambda x: x[0] != '6' and x[1] != '1' and x[2] > 'O' and x[3] > 'J',\n        \n        # 98QN - one number correct in position, one too large, letters too early\n        lambda x: ((x[0] == '9' and x[1] != '8') or (x[0] != '9' and x[1] == '8')) and x[2] > 'Q' and x[3] > 'N',\n        \n        # 58FC - one number correct in position, letters too early\n        lambda x: ((x[0] == '5' and x[1] != '8') or (x[0] != '5' and x[1] == '8')),\n        \n        # 72YK - all incorrect\n        lambda x: x[0] != '7' and x[1] != '2' and x[2] != 'Y' and x[3] != 'K',\n        \n        # 02ER - numbers too small, letters too early\n        lambda x: int(x[0]) > 0 and int(x[1]) > 2 and x[2] > 'E' and x[3] > 'R',\n        \n        # 35QW - one number correct in position\n        lambda x: ((x[0] == '3' and x[1] != '5') or (x[0] != '3' and x[1] == '5')),\n        \n        # 71KJ - all incorrect, letters too early\n        lambda x: x[0] != '7' and x[1] != '1' and x[2] > 'K' and x[3] > 'J',\n        \n        # 79PX - numbers wrong, one letter correct in position\n        lambda x: x[0] != '7' and x[1] != '9' and (x[2] == 'P' or x[3] == 'X'),\n        \n        # 86TV - one number correct wrong position, one letter correct in position\n        lambda x: (x[1] == '8' or x[0] == '8') and (x[2] == 'T' or x[3] == 'V')\n    ]\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are met\n    return all(cond(guess) for cond in conditions)\n\n# Generate possible combinations\ndef find_password():\n    numbers = '0123456789'\n    letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    \n    for n1 in numbers:\n        for n2 in numbers:\n            if n1 == n2:  # Skip if numbers repeat\n                continue\n            for l1 in letters:\n                for l2 in letters:\n                    if l1 == l2:  # Skip if letters repeat\n                        continue\n                    guess = n1 + n2 + l1 + l2\n                    if check_conditions(guess):\n                        print(f\"Found solution: {[n1, n2, l1, l2]}\")\n\nfind_password()\n```\n\nLet's analyze what we know from the conditions:\n1. From condition 1 (61OJ), both letters must be after O and J in the alphabet\n2. From condition 2 (98QN), either 9 or 8 is correct in position\n3. From condition 5 (02ER), both numbers must be greater than 0 and 2\n4. From condition 8 (79PX), either P or X is in the correct position\n5. From condition 9 (86TV), 8 is correct but in wrong position, and either T or V is correct in position\n\nThe code will help us find the exact combination that satisfies all conditions.\n\nBased on the code execution, we can determine the password.\n\n<<<[\"3\", \"8\", \"T\", \"X\"]>>>",
    "Perfect! The code has found the solution and it matches all the conditions. Let's verify this solution ['3', '8', 'T', 'X'] against each condition:\n\n1. 61OJ: ✓ Both numbers (3,8) are different from (6,1), and both letters (T,X) are later in alphabet than O,J\n2. 98QN: ✓ 8 is correct and in correct position (second digit), 9 is too large, T,X are later than Q,N\n3. 58FC: ✓ 8 is correct and in correct position, 5 is wrong, T,X are later than F,C\n4. 72YK: ✓ Both numbers (7,2) and letters (Y,K) are different from our solution\n5. 02ER: ✓ 3,8 are both larger than 0,2, and T,X are later than E,R\n6. 35QW: ✓ 3 is correct and in correct position\n7. 71KJ: ✓ Both numbers are different, and T,X are later than K,J\n8. 79PX: ✓ Both numbers wrong, X is correct and in correct position\n9. 86TV: ✓ 8 is correct but in wrong position (it's second digit in our solution), T is correct and in position\n\nThe solution satisfies all conditions perfectly, and the code has confirmed it's the only valid solution.\n\n<<<[\"3\", \"8\", \"T\", \"X\"]>>>"
