From guess 4 (05QJ):\n   - J must be present but in a different position\n   - This means J must be in first letter position (as we see it in second position in 05QJ)\n\n3. From guess 6 (95WT):\n   - Both letters must come before W\n   - Letters must not be T\n\n4. Looking at all guesses:\n   - Invalid letters: V,M,U,E,F,O,Z,Q,W,T,K,R\n   - Second letter must be after J in alphabet (because if it were before J, then J would need to be in second position, which contradicts guess 4)\n\nLet's write a final refined code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_14VM(guess):\n    return guess[0] == '1' and int(guess[1]) > 4\n\ndef check_91UE(guess):\n    return (guess[0] != '9' and guess[1] != '1' and \n            guess[2] not in 'UE' and guess[3] not in 'UE')\n\ndef check_85FO(guess):\n    return (guess[0] != '8' and guess[1] != '5' and \n            guess[2] not in 'FO' and guess[3] not in 'FO')\n\ndef check_05QJ(guess):\n    return (guess[0] != '0' and guess[1] != '5' and\n            guess[2] == 'J' and guess[3] not in 'QJ')  # J must be in first letter position\n\ndef check_85ZQ(guess):\n    return (guess[0] != '8' and guess[1] != '5' and \n            guess[2] not in 'ZQ' and guess[3] not in 'ZQ')\n\ndef check_95WT(guess):\n    return (guess[0] != '9' and guess[1] != '5' and \n            all(c < 'W' for c in guess[2:]))\n\ndef check_57KR(guess):\n    return (guess[0] != '5' and guess[1] != '7' and \n            guess[2] not in 'KR' and guess[3] not in 'KR')\n\ndef check_letter_order(guess):\n    # Second letter must be after J in alphabet\n    return guess[3] > 'J'\n\n# We know first number is 1 and second is 6\nnumbers = ['1', '6']\n# We know first letter is J\n# Second letter must be after J but before W, and not in invalid set\ninvalid_letters = set('VMUEFOZKRWTQ')\nvalid_second_letters = [c for c in [chr(i) for i in range(ord('J')+1, ord('W'))]\n                       if c not in invalid_letters]\n\nsolutions = []\nfor l2 in valid_second_letters:\n    guess = numbers[0] + numbers[1] + 'J' + l2\n    if all([\n        check_14VM(guess),\n        check_91UE(guess),\n        check_85FO(guess),\n        check_05QJ(guess),\n        check_85ZQ(guess),\n        check_95WT(guess),\n        check_57KR(guess),\n        check_letter_order(guess)\n    ]):\n        solutions.append([numbers[0], numbers[1], 'J', l2])\n\nprint(solutions)\n```\n\nBased on all these refined conditions:\n- First number must be 1\n- Second number must be 6\n- First letter must be J\n- Second letter must be after J in alphabet but before W\n- Second letter can't be any of the invalid letters\n\nThe most logical solution is:\n\n<<<[1, 6, \"J\", \"P\"]>>>\n\nThis solution satisfies all conditions:\n- 1,6 are the correct numbers\n- J is in first letter position (different from guess 4)\n- P comes after J but before W in alphabet\n- P isn't used in any incorrect guesses\n- All other conditions from negative guesses are satisfied",
    "I notice we still have multiple solutions: [1,6,J,L], [1,6,J,N], [1,6,J,P], and [1,6,J,S]. Let me analyze the conditions one final time to find the unique solution:\n\n1. We are certain about:\n   - First number is 1\n   - Second number is 6\n   - First letter is J\n   - Second letter must be after J and before W\n\n2. Looking at guess 4 (05QJ) more carefully:\n   - One letter is correct but in wrong position (we know it's J)\n   - One letter is incorrect\n   - This means the second letter cannot be L, N, or P because these letters weren't tested in guess 4\n   - Only S appears in a later guess (95WT) where we know both letters are incorrect and too late in alphabet\n\n3. Looking at guess 6 (95WT):\n   - Both letters are incorrect and \"too late in the alphabet\"\n   - S is too late in the alphabet (as it's closer to T,W)\n   - This eliminates S as a possibility\n\n4. Therefore, among L, N, P:\n   - P is closest to Q (from guess 4)\n   - This makes P the most logical choice as it would be the letter that was \"tested\" as incorrect in guess 4\n\nBased on this final analysis:\n\n<<<[1, 6, \"J\", \"N\"]>>>\n\nThis solution satisfies all conditions:\n- 1,6 are the correct numbers\n- J is in first letter position (different from guess 4)\n- N comes after J but before W in alphabet\n- N isn't used in any incorrect guesses\n- N is not too late in alphabet (unlike S)\n- N provides the most consistent interpretation of all the clues, especially regarding the feedback from guesses 4 and 6\n- All other conditions from negative guesses are satisfied"
