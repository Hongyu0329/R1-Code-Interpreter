From guesses 1-3, we know that one number is correct but in wrong position, and it must be either 7, 2, 6, or 9\n2. From guess 8 (96MJ), we know that one number is correct and in correct position\n3. From multiple guesses with \"both numbers too small\", we can deduce that both numbers in the password must be relatively large\n4. From the letter feedback, we know that the correct letters must be later in the alphabet than most guessed letters\n5. From guess 4 (40QT), we know that Q or T must be in the password but in a different position\n\nLet me write a more focused code to narrow down the possibilities:\n\n```python\ndef check_conditions(password):\n    n1, n2 = int(password[0]), int(password[1])\n    l1, l2 = password[2], password[3]\n    \n    # Numbers must be large (based on multiple \"too small\" feedbacks)\n    if n1 < 6 or n2 < 6:\n        return False\n    \n    # Letters must be late in alphabet (based on multiple \"too early\" feedbacks)\n    if l1 < 'Q' or l2 < 'Q':\n        return False\n    \n    # Check specific conditions from key guesses\n    # Guess 8 (96MJ): one number correct and in position\n    if n1 != 9 and n2 != 6:  # Either 9 or 6 must be in correct position\n        return False\n    \n    # Guess 4 (40QT): Q or T must be in password but wrong position\n    if 'Q' not in [l1, l2] and 'T' not in [l1, l2]:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\nvalid_passwords = []\nnumbers = range(10)\nletters = [chr(i) for i in range(ord('Q'), ord('Z')+1)]  # Q-Z only\n\nfor n1 in numbers:\n    for n2 in numbers:\n        if n1 != n2:\n            for l1 in letters:\n                for l2 in letters:\n                    if l1 != l2:\n                        password = [str(n1), str(n2), l1, l2]\n                        if check_conditions(password):\n                            valid_passwords.append(password)\n\nprint(valid_passwords)\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and analysis of all conditions:\n1. The numbers must be 9 and 6 (from multiple conditions)\n2. The letters must be Q and T (from condition 4 and other \"too early\" feedbacks)\n3. The position of 9 must be first (from condition 8)\n4. Q and T must be in specific positions to satisfy all conditions\n\n<<<[\"9\", \"6\", \"T\", \"Q\"]>>>",

From guess \"96MJ\": One number is correct and in correct position\n2. From guess \"40QT\": Q or T must be in the password but in wrong position\n3. From multiple guesses: Both numbers must be large (>6)\n4. From multiple guesses: Letters must be late in alphabet\n5. From guess \"71BQ\": One number is correct but in wrong position\n\nAfter running this more precise code and analyzing the output, we can determine that:\n1. 9 must be in the first position (from guess \"96MJ\")\n2.

First number must be 9 (from \"96MJ\" - one number correct in position)\n2. Second number must be 8 (from \"89XJ\" - one number correct but wrong position)\n3. Letters must be Q and T (from \"40QT\" - one letter correct but wrong position)\n4. The specific arrangement must satisfy all other conditions\n\nBased on all the conditions and cross-referencing:\n\n<<<[\"9\", \"8\", \"Q\", \"T\"]>>>",
    "I see the code output gives us some important insights. Let me analyze the conditions again:\n\n1. From \"71BQ\": one number correct but wrong position (7), one small, both letters early\n   - This confirms 7 is in the password\n   - Both B and Q are before the correct letters\n\n2. From \"40QT\": both numbers too small, one letter correct but wrong position, one early\n   - This confirms either Q or T is in the password but in wrong position\n   - Both 4 and 0 are too small\n\n3. From \"96MJ\": one number correct in position (9), one small, both letters early\n   - This confirms 9 is in the first position\n   - Both M and J are before the correct letters\n\n4. From \"89XJ\": one number correct but wrong position, letters incorrect\n   - Since we know 9 is in first position, this means 8 is not in the password\n\n5. Looking at the code output, we can see:\n   - First number must be 9\n   - Second number must be 7\n   - First letter must be T\n   - Second letter must be one of R, S, U, V\n\n6. Additional conditions:\n   - From \"40QT\": Since T is in first letter position, Q must be the letter that's correct but in wrong position\n   - This means Q must be the second letter\n\nTherefore, combining all these conditions:\n- First number is 9 (confirmed)\n- Second number is 7 (confirmed)\n- First letter is T (confirmed)\n- Second letter must be Q (based on \"40QT\" condition)\n\n<<<[\"9\", \"7\", \"T\", \"Q\"]>>>"
