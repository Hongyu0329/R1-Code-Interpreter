    "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's analyze what we know:\n   - Password format: 2 numbers (no repeats) + 2 letters (no repeats)\n   - Numbers are single digits (0-9)\n   - Letters are uppercase (A-Z)\n\n2) From the first guess (97EJ):\n   - Both numbers (9,7) are too large\n   - One letter (E or J) is correct but wrong position\n   - One letter is completely wrong\n\n3) From the second guess (43OM):\n   - Both numbers (4,3) are too large\n   - Both letters (O,M) are too late in alphabet\n\n4) From the third guess (20BQ):\n   - One number (2,0) is correct but wrong position\n   - One number is too large\n   - One letter (B,Q) is correct but wrong position\n   - One letter is too late in alphabet\n\nLet's write code to solve this systematically:\n\n```python\ndef check_guess(numbers, letters):\n    # Check first guess (97EJ)\n    if numbers[0] >= 9 or numbers[1] >= 7:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check second guess (43OM)\n    if numbers[0] >= 4 or numbers[1] >= 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check third guess (20BQ)\n    num_correct = 0\n    if numbers[0] == 2 or numbers[0] == 0:\n        num_correct += 1\n    if numbers[1] == 2 or numbers[1] == 0:\n        num_correct += 1\n    if num_correct != 1:\n        return False\n    if max(numbers) >= 2 and max(numbers) != 2 and max(numbers) != 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Letter checks\n    alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    \n    # From first guess (97EJ)\n    ej_correct = 0\n    if 'E' in letters or 'J' in letters:\n        ej_correct += 1\n    if ej_correct != 1:\n        return False\n    \n    # From second guess (43OM)\n    if any(l >= 'O' for l in letters):\n        return False\n    \n    # From third guess (20BQ)\n    bq_correct = 0\n    if 'B' in letters or 'Q' in letters:\n        bq_correct += 1\n    if bq_correct != 1:\n        return False\n    if 'Q' in letters:  # Q is too late in alphabet\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible combinations\nvalid_solutions = []\nnumbers = list(range(10))\nletters = [chr(i) for i in range(65, 91)]  # A-Z\n\nfor n1 in range(10):\n    for n2 in range(10):\n        if n1 != n2:\n            for l1 in letters:\n                for l2 in letters:\n                    if l1 != l2:\n                        if check_guess([n1, n2], [l1, l2]):\n                            valid_solutions.append([str(n1), str(n2), l1, l2])\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nBased on the code execution, let's analyze the solution:\n\n1) The numbers must be less than 4 and 3 (from second guess)\n2) One of 2 or 0 must be in the solution (from third guess)\n3) The letters must be before 'O' in the alphabet\n4) One letter must be either 'E' or 'J'\n5) One letter must be 'B' (since 'Q' is too late in alphabet)\n6) The letters can't be 'O', 'M', or 'Q'\n\nThe code will find all valid combinations that satisfy these conditions.\n\n<<<[2, 0, B, E]>>>",
