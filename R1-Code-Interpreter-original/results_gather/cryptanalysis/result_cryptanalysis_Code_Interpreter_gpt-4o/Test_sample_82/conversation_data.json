    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities based on the given conditions.\n\n1. **Guess: 87CF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 71SM**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 23AY**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 53PD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 01UF**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 43US**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nLet's deduce the correct numbers and letters step by step:\n\n### Numbers:\n- From Guess 1: 8 and 7 are too large.\n- From Guess 2: 7 is too large, 1 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From Guess 3: 2 and 3 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 4: 5 and 3 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 5: 0 is correct but in the wrong position, 1 is incorrect and too small.\n- From Guess 6: 4 and 3 are incorrect.\n\nFrom the above, the possible numbers are 0 and 6. Since 0 is correct but in the wrong position in Guess 5, it must be the second number. Therefore, 6 must be the first number.\n\n### Letters:\n- From Guess 1: C and F are too early.\n- From Guess 2: S is correct but in the wrong position, M is too late.\n- From Guess 3: A and Y are incorrect.\n- From Guess 4: P is correct but in the wrong position, D is too early.\n- From Guess 5: U and F are incorrect.\n- From Guess 6: U and S are too late.\n\nFrom the above, the possible letters are S and P. Since S is correct but in the wrong position in Guess 2, it must be the second letter. Therefore, P must be the first letter.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n\\[ \\text{[\"6\", \"0\", \"P\", \"S\"]} \\]"
