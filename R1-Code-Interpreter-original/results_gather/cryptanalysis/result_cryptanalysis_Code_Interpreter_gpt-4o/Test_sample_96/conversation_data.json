    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 1 (16QS), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2 (23YQ), one number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 3 (92FQ), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (13MS), one number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 5 (51BU), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6 (62RQ), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7 (37HS), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 8 (58IJ), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 9 (46WB), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 10 (46BP), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 11 (43PR), one number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 12 (60CA), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 13 (90QC), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 14 (94OG), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n\n   Based on the above, the possible numbers are 0, 3, and 7. From guess 7, 3 is in the correct position, and from guess 12, 0 is in the correct position.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1 (16QS), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 2 (23YQ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 3 (92FQ), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (13MS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (51BU), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6 (62RQ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7 (37HS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (58IJ), one letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 9 (46WB), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 10 (46BP), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11 (43PR), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 12 (60CA), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 13 (90QC), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 14 (94OG), both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From guess 8, one letter is correct but in the wrong position. The possible letters are E and D, as they are not too early or too late in the alphabet.\n\nLet's deduce the correct combination based on this information.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the analysis\npossible_numbers = [0, 3, 7]\npossible_letters = ['E', 'D']\n\n# The correct positions based on the analysis\n# From guess 7, 3 is in the correct position (first number)\n# From guess 12, 0 is in the correct position (second number)\n# From guess 8, one letter is correct but in the wrong position\n\n# Deduce the correct combination\ncorrect_combination = [3, 0, 'E', 'D']\n\ncorrect_combination\nassistant > The correct password for the combination lock is \\([3, 0, 'E', 'D']\\)."
