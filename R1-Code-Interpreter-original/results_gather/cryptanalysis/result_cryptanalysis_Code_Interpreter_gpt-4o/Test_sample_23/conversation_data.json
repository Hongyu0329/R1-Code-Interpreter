    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 98LZ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 82EM**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 36ZI**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 21HR**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nLet's deduce the correct numbers and letters step by step:\n\n### Numbers:\n- From guess 1 (98LZ), one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 8 is too large (from guess 2), 9 is the correct number in the first position.\n- From guess 2 (82EM), one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 8 is too large, 2 is the correct number but not in the second position.\n- From guess 3 (36ZI), both numbers are incorrect, confirming that 3 and 6 are not part of the password.\n- From guess 4 (21HR), one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 2 is already identified as correct but not in the second position, 1 is incorrect.\n\nThus, the numbers are 9 and 2, with 9 in the first position and 2 in the second position.\n\n### Letters:\n- From guess 1 (98LZ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet, so L and Z are not part of the password.\n- From guess 2 (82EM), one letter is correct but in the wrong position. Since M is too late, E is correct but not in the third position.\n- From guess 3 (36ZI), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet, confirming that Z and I are not part of the password.\n- From guess 4 (21HR), one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since R is too late, H is correct and in the third position.\n\nThus, the letters are H and E, with H in the third position and E in the fourth position.\n\nThe correct password is:\n\n\\[ \\text{[\"9\", \"2\", \"H\", \"E\"]} \\]"
