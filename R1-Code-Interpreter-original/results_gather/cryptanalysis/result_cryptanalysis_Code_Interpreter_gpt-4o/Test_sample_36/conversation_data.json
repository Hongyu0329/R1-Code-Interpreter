    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 09OW**\n   - Both numbers (0 and 9) are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - Both letters (O and W) are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 71BK**\n   - Both numbers (7 and 1) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (B and K) are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 40TV**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position (0 or 4).\n   - One number is incorrect (4 or 0).\n   - Both letters (T and V) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 92SU**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position (9 or 2).\n   - One number is incorrect (2 or 9).\n   - One letter (S) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter (U) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 41SD**\n   - Both numbers (4 and 1) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (S and D) are correct and in the correct positions.\n\nFrom the above feedback, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The correct numbers are 0 and 9, as confirmed by the first guess.\n- The correct letters are S and D, as confirmed by the fifth guess.\n- The order of the numbers is 09, as confirmed by the first guess.\n- The order of the letters is SD, as confirmed by the fifth guess.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<< [\"0\", \"9\", \"S\", \"D\"] >>>}\n\\]"
