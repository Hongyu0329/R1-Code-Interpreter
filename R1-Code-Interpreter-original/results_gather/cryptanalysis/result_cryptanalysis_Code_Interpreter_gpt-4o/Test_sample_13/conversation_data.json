    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 95VB**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 34OH**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 63TK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 61XN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nLet's deduce the password step by step:\n\n- From guess 1, we know that one of the numbers 9 or 5 is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect. Both letters V and B are incorrect.\n- From guess 2, both numbers 3 and 4 are incorrect. One letter O or H is correct and in the correct position, and the other is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n- From guess 3, both numbers 6 and 3 are incorrect, and both letters T and K are incorrect.\n- From guess 4, one of the numbers 6 or 1 is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect. One letter X or N is correct and in the correct position, and the other is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nLet's deduce the correct numbers and letters:\n\n- **Numbers:**\n  - From guess 1, either 9 or 5 is correct but in the wrong position.\n  - From guess 2, 3 and 4 are incorrect.\n  - From guess 3, 6 is incorrect.\n  - From guess 4, either 6 or 1 is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n  Since 6 is incorrect, 1 must be the correct number but in the wrong position. Therefore, 9 is the correct number but in the wrong position from guess 1.\n\n- **Letters:**\n  - From guess 2, one of the letters O or H is correct and in the correct position. Since O is too early in the alphabet, H is the correct letter in the correct position.\n  - From guess 4, one of the letters X or N is correct and in the correct position. Since N is too late in the alphabet, X is the correct letter in the correct position.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n- Numbers: 1 and 9 (in the wrong positions from the guesses)\n- Letters: H and X (in the correct positions)\n\nThe password is <<< [\"1\", \"9\", \"H\", \"X\"] >>>."
