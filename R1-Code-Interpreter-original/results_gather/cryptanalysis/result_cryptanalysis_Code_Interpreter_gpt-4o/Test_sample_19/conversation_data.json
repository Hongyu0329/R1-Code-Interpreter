    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 18WV**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 76GH**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 75LE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 12BZ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From guess 2 and 3, since both numbers are too small, the numbers must be greater than 7 and 5. Therefore, the possible numbers are 8 and 9.\n- From guess 1, since one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small, the correct number in the first position is 8.\n- From guess 4, since both numbers are too small, the second number must be 9.\n\nFor the letters:\n- From guess 2 and 3, since both letters are too early in the alphabet, the letters must be later than G, H, L, and E.\n- From guess 1, since one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet, the correct letter in the third position is V.\n- From guess 4, since one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet, the correct letter in the fourth position is Z.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n\\[ \\text{[\"8\", \"9\", \"V\", \"Z\"]} \\]"
