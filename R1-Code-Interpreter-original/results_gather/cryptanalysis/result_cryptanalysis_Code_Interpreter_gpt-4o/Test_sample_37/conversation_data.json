    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 03OQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 76EC**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 83FO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 47OF**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 87LK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The numbers must be between 4 and 7, as 03 is too small and 76 is too large.\n- From guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and the other is too large. This means 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 5, both numbers are too large, confirming that 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n- The second number must be smaller than 7, and since 3 and 7 are incorrect, the second number must be 5.\n\nFor the letters:\n- From guess 1, both letters are too late in the alphabet, so they must be earlier than O and Q.\n- From guess 2, both letters are too early in the alphabet, so they must be later than E and C.\n- From guess 3, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too late. Since F is too late, O must be correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, O is correct but in the wrong position, confirming that O is the second letter.\n- From guess 5, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too late. Since L is too late, K must be correct and in the correct position.\n\nThus, the password is:\n\n- Numbers: 4 and 5\n- Letters: K and O\n\nThe correct password is <<< [\"4\", \"5\", \"K\", \"O\"] >>>."
