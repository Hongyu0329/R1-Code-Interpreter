    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 47YQ**\n   - Both numbers (4, 7) are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (Y, Q) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 91LQ**\n   - Both numbers (9, 1) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (L or Q) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter (L or Q) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 23TP**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters (T, P) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 09KG**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter (K or G) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter (K or G) is incorrect and incorrect.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce:\n\n- The numbers must be less than 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be 9, 1, 2, 3, 0, or 7. This leaves us with 5 and 6 as possible numbers.\n- From guess 3 and 4, one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 0 is incorrect and 9 is incorrect, the correct number from guess 4 must be 6, and it is in the wrong position.\n- From guess 3, the correct number is 2 or 3, but since 3 is incorrect, the correct number must be 2, and it is in the wrong position.\n- The letters must be earlier than Y, Q, T, P, and one of L or Q is correct and in the correct position. Since Q is too late, L is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect. Since L is already correct, K or G must be correct. Since G is incorrect, K is correct and in the correct position.\n\nThus, the password is:\n\n- Numbers: 6 and 2 (6 in the second position, 2 in the first position)\n- Letters: L and K (L in the third position, K in the fourth position)\n\nThe correct password is: <<< [\"2\", \"6\", \"L\", \"K\"] >>>"
