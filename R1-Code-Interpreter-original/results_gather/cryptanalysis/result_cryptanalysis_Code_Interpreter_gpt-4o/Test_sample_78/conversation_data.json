    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 14HF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 38FX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 52YF**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 32QI**\n   - Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 71DX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From guess 4, the correct numbers are 3 and 2, but they are in the wrong positions. So, the correct order is 23.\n- From guess 1, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect. Since F is incorrect (as per guess 2 and 3), H is the correct letter but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 5, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. Since D is too late in the alphabet, X is the correct letter and in the correct position.\n\nThus, the correct password is 23HX.\n\nLet's format the answer as requested: <<< [\"2\", \"3\", \"H\", \"X\"] >>>."
