    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 95WC**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 12XN**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 92LS**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\nLet's deduce the password step by step:\n\n### Numbers:\n- From Guess 1 and Guess 3, the number 9 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From Guess 2, the number 1 is correct and in the correct position.\n- Therefore, the numbers are 1 and 9, with 1 in the first position and 9 in the second position.\n\n### Letters:\n- From Guess 1, W is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 2, both X and N are incorrect.\n- From Guess 3, L is correct but in the wrong position.\n- Therefore, the letters are L and W, with W in the third position and L in the fourth position.\n\nCombining these deductions, the password is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Password: } [1, 9, W, L]\n\\]\n\nLet's format it as requested: <<< [\"1\", \"9\", \"W\", \"L\"] >>>."
