    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 28MV**\n   - Both numbers (2 and 8) are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 41FX**\n   - Both numbers (4 and 1) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (F and X) are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 58VP**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 93IT**\n   - Both numbers (9 and 3) are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the feedback, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From Guess 1, the numbers 2 and 8 are correct and in the correct positions.\n- From Guess 2, the letters F and X are incorrect.\n- From Guess 3, the number 8 is correct and in the correct position, and the letter V is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From Guess 4, the letters I and T are incorrect, and one letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nBased on this information, let's deduce the correct password:\n\n- The numbers are 2 and 8.\n- The correct letter from Guess 1 is M, and it is in the correct position.\n- The correct letter from Guess 3 is V, but it is in the wrong position.\n- The incorrect letters that are too early in the alphabet are M (from Guess 1), P (from Guess 3), and T (from Guess 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct password is likely to be:\n\n- Numbers: 2, 8\n- Letters: M, V\n\nLet's verify this deduction:\n\n- The correct password should be in the format [\"2\", \"8\", \"M\", \"V\"].\n\nLet's check if this combination satisfies all the conditions.\nassistant > Upon reviewing the deductions, it seems I made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let's re-evaluate the conditions:\n\n1. **Guess: 28MV**\n   - Numbers 2 and 8 are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 41FX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 58VP**\n   - Number 8 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - Number 5 is incorrect.\n   - Letter V is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - Letter P is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 93IT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these observations:\n\n- The numbers are confirmed to be 2 and 8.\n- From Guess 1, M is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 3, V is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From Guess 4, the correct letter in the wrong position is likely V, as T is too early in the alphabet.\n\nThus, the correct password should be:\n\n- Numbers: 2, 8\n- Letters: M, V\n\nThe correct format is [\"2\", \"8\", \"M\", \"V\"]. Let's verify this combination:\n\n- Numbers 2 and 8 are in the correct positions.\n- M is in the correct position.\n- V is in the correct position.\n\nThis combination satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"8\", \"M\", \"V\"] >>>"
