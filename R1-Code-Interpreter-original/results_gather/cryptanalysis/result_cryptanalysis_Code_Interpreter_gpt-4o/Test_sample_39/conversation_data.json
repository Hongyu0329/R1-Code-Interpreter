    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from the two guesses:\n\n### Guess 1: 87ID\n- One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n- One number is incorrect and too large.\n- One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n- One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Guess 2: 50FH\n- Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n- One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n- One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From Guess 1, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. This means one of the numbers 8 or 7 is correct but misplaced, and the other is too large.\n   - From Guess 2, both numbers 5 and 0 are incorrect and too small. This means the correct numbers must be larger than 5 and 0.\n   - Combining these, the correct numbers must be 6 and 9, as they are larger than 5 and 0, and one of 8 or 7 is too large.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From Guess 1, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means one of the letters I or D is correct but misplaced, and the other is too early.\n   - From Guess 2, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means one of the letters F or H is correct but misplaced, and the other is too early.\n   - Combining these, the correct letters must be J and G, as they are later in the alphabet than I, D, F, and H.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct password is a combination of the numbers 6 and 9, and the letters J and G. Let's determine the correct order:\n\n- From Guess 1, the correct number and letter are in the wrong positions.\n- From Guess 2, the correct number and letter are also in the wrong positions.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<< [\"9\", \"6\", \"G\", \"J\"] >>>}\n\\]"
