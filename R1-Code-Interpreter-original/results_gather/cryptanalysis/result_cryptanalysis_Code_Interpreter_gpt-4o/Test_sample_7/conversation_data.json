    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 08VY**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 07CX**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 45NJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 28YQ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nLet's deduce the password step by step:\n\n### Numbers:\n- From Guess 1 and 2, since one number is correct and in the correct position, and the other is too large, the correct number in the correct position is likely '0' in the first position.\n- From Guess 3, both numbers are too large, so the numbers must be less than 4 and 5.\n- From Guess 4, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is too large. Since '2' is less than '8', '2' is likely the correct number but in the wrong position.\n\n### Letters:\n- From Guess 1, both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet, so they must be earlier than 'V' and 'Y'.\n- From Guess 2, both letters are incorrect, so they are not 'C' or 'X'.\n- From Guess 3, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect. Since 'N' is earlier in the alphabet than 'J', 'N' is likely correct.\n- From Guess 4, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is too late in the alphabet. Since 'Y' is too late, 'Q' is incorrect, and 'N' is likely the correct letter but in the wrong position.\n\nBased on this analysis, let's deduce the password.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the analysis\npossible_numbers = ['0', '2']\npossible_letters = ['N']\n\n# Deduce the correct positions based on the feedback\n# Since '0' is correct and in the correct position in the first guess, it should be the first number\n# '2' is correct but in the wrong position, so it should be the second number\n# 'N' is correct but in the wrong position in the third guess, so it should be the second letter\n\n# The first letter should be earlier than 'N' and not 'C', 'X', 'V', 'Y', or 'Q'\n# Possible letters earlier than 'N' are 'A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M'\n\n# Let's try 'M' as the first letter since it is the closest to 'N' and not used in any guess\n\npassword = [\"0\", \"2\", \"M\", \"N\"]\npassword\nassistant > The deduced password for the combination lock is: \\(\\texttt{[\"0\", \"2\", \"M\", \"N\"]}\\)."
