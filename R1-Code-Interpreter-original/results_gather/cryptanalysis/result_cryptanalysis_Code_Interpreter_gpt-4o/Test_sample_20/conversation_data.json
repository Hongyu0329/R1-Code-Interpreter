    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 35PQ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 24XE**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 96SQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 25XC**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From guess 3, since both numbers (9 and 6) are too large, the numbers must be less than 6.\n- From guess 1, since one number is correct and one is too large, and from guess 2, one number is correct and one is too small, the correct number must be 3 or 4.\n- From guess 4, both numbers are incorrect, so the numbers cannot be 2 or 5.\n- Therefore, the numbers must be 3 and 4.\n\n- From guess 1, both letters (P and Q) are too late in the alphabet.\n- From guess 2, one letter (X) is correct and in the correct position, and E is too late.\n- From guess 3, both letters (S and Q) are too late.\n- From guess 4, one letter (C) is correct but in the wrong position, and X is too late.\n- Therefore, the letters must be C and a letter earlier than C, which is A or B.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The numbers are 3 and 4.\n- The letters are C and A or B.\n\nLet's determine the correct order by checking the positions:\n\n- From guess 2, X is correct and in the correct position, so the first letter is C.\n- From guess 4, C is correct but in the wrong position, so the second letter is A.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n\\[ \\text{[\"3\", \"4\", \"C\", \"A\"]} \\]"
