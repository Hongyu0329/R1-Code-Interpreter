    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 64RY**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers 6 and 4, and the letters R and Y are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 51MB**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers 5 and 1, and the letters M and B are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 29PV**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers 2 and 9, and the letters P and V are not in the password.\n\n4. **Guess: 71EW**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect; both letters are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 7 or 1 is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect. The letters E and W are correct but in the wrong positions.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- The possible numbers are 0, 3, 7, and 8 (since 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, and 9 are incorrect).\n- The possible letters are E and W (since R, Y, M, B, P, and V are incorrect).\n\nSince one of the numbers 7 or 1 is correct and in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect, the correct number must be 7 or 1. However, since 1 is already ruled out, the correct number is 7.\n\nNow, let's deduce the correct combination:\n- The numbers are 0, 3, 7, and 8.\n- The letters are E and W, but they need to be swapped.\n\nLet's try to deduce the correct combination:\n\n- Since 7 is correct but in the wrong position, it cannot be the first number.\n- The letters E and W need to be swapped.\n\nThus, the correct combination is:\n- Numbers: 8 and 7 (since 7 cannot be the first number, it must be the second).\n- Letters: W and E (since they need to be swapped).\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<< [\"8\", \"7\", \"W\", \"E\"] >>>}\n\\]"
