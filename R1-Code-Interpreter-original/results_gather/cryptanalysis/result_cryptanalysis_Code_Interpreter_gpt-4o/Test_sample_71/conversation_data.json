    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and apply logical reasoning to eliminate possibilities. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 1 (65HO), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This means one of 6 or 5 is correct but misplaced, and the other is too small.\n   - From guess 2 (47IM), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3 (10GI), both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 4 (70XG), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (12JU), both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 6 (52SZ), both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 7 (64AV), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 8 (85BO), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 9 (98RX), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 10 (60JU), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 11 (75UC), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 12 (79NC), both numbers are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - The correct numbers are 8 and 9, as they are the only numbers not eliminated by the feedback.\n   - From guess 8, 8 is in the correct position.\n   - From guess 9, 9 is in the wrong position, so the correct order is 89.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1 (65HO), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2 (47IM), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3 (10GI), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 4 (70XG), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (12JU), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 6 (52SZ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7 (64AV), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (85BO), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9 (98RX), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 10 (60JU), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 11 (75UC), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 12 (79NC), one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - The correct letters are J and N, as they are the only letters not eliminated by the feedback.\n   - From guess 5 and 10, J is in the correct position.\n   - From guess 12, N is in the wrong position, so the correct order is JN.\n\nCombining the numbers and letters, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"9\", \"J\", \"N\"] >>>"
