    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 25YN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 42CQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 76KC**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 26SG**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nLet's deduce the password step by step:\n\n- From guess 2, both numbers (4 and 2) are too small, so the numbers must be greater than 4.\n- From guess 3, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 7 is too large, 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 2 is too small, 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 1, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 2 is too small, 5 is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nThus, the numbers are 65.\n\n- From guess 1, both letters (Y and N) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n- From guess 2, both letters (C and Q) are incorrect.\n- From guess 3, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since C is too early, K is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. Since G is too late, S is correct and in the correct position.\n\nThus, the letters are KS.\n\nThe correct password is \\([6, 5, K, S]\\).\n\nLet's verify this deduction.\nassistant > The deduced password is \\([6, 5, K, S]\\). Let's verify this deduction against each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 25YN**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position (5 is correct but in the wrong position).\n   - One number is incorrect and too small (2 is too small).\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet (Y and N are too late).\n\n2. **Guess: 42CQ**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect and too small (4 and 2 are too small).\n   - Both letters are incorrect (C and Q are incorrect).\n\n3. **Guess: 76KC**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct and in the correct position (6 is correct and in the correct position).\n   - One number is incorrect and too large (7 is too large).\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position (K is correct and in the correct position).\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet (C is too early).\n\n4. **Guess: 26SG**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct and in the correct position (6 is correct and in the correct position).\n   - One number is incorrect and too small (2 is too small).\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position (S is correct and in the correct position).\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet (G is too late).\n\nThe deduced password \\([6, 5, K, S]\\) satisfies all the conditions provided in the feedback. Therefore, the correct password is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<< [\"6\", \"5\", \"K\", \"S\"] >>>}\n\\]"
