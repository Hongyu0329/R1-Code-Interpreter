    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 91SF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 03HF**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 75CP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 64YB**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\nLet's deduce the numbers and letters step by step:\n\n### Numbers:\n- From Guess 1 (91SF), both numbers 9 and 1 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 2 (03HF), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is too small, 3 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 3 (75CP), both numbers 7 and 5 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 4 (64YB), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and incorrect. Since 3 is already correct from Guess 2, 6 is incorrect, so 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n\nThus, the numbers are 3 and 4.\n\n### Letters:\n- From Guess 1 (91SF), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. Since F is incorrect in Guess 2, S is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 2 (03HF), both letters H and F are incorrect.\n- From Guess 3 (75CP), one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. Since C is incorrect in Guess 4, P is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From Guess 4 (64YB), both letters Y and B are incorrect.\n\nThus, the letters are S and P, with S in the correct position and P in the wrong position.\n\nCombining these deductions, the correct password is:\n\n- Numbers: 3 and 4\n- Letters: S and P\n\nThe correct format is <<< [\"3\", \"4\", \"S\", \"P\"] >>>."
