    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and identify the possible numbers and letters that satisfy all the conditions.\n\n### Analyzing the Feedback:\n\n1. **Guess: 20VX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 73GA**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 13KM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 74CD**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 57GT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 32XO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 82EL**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n8. **Guess: 25DA**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n9. **Guess: 87WU**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n10. **Guess: 95ZM**\n    - Both numbers are incorrect.\n    - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From guesses 1, 3, 6, and 8, we know that numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 are too small.\n- From guesses 2, 4, 5, and 8, we know that numbers 7 and 5 are incorrect.\n- From guess 4, one of the numbers 7 or 4 is correct and in the correct position. Since 7 is incorrect, 4 is correct and in the first position.\n- From guess 7, number 8 is correct and in the first position, but since 4 is already correct in the first position, 8 must be incorrect.\n- From guess 9, number 8 is incorrect, so number 7 is correct and in the second position.\n- From guess 10, numbers 9 and 5 are incorrect.\n\nThus, the numbers are 4 and 7.\n\n- From guesses 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, letters A, C, D, E, G, K, L, M, and T are too early in the alphabet.\n- From guess 1, letters V and X are incorrect.\n- From guess 6, letters X and O are incorrect.\n- From guess 9, letter W is correct and in the correct position, and letter U is incorrect.\n- From guess 10, letter Z is correct and in the correct position, and letter M is incorrect and too early.\n\nThus, the letters are Z and W.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correct password is:\n\n\\[ \\text{[\"4\", \"7\", \"Z\", \"W\"]} \\]"
