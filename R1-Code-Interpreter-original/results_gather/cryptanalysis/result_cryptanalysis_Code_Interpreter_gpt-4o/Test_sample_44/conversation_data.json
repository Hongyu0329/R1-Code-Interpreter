    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use the process of elimination to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 6 (76KR), both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - From guess 1 (71HT), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This suggests that 7 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 10 (36ZF), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This suggests that 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - Therefore, the numbers are 7 and 6.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 6 (76KR), one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect.\n   - From guess 12 (65FG), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 11 (26SR), one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 2 (19ZS), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 5 (25IP), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (49FO), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3 (48PA), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 1 (71HT), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9 (02NE), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (31ZP), both letters are incorrect.\n\n   Based on the feedback, the correct letters are likely to be K and G, with K in the second position and G in the first position.\n\nLet's verify this deduction:\n\n- Numbers: 7 and 6\n- Letters: G and K\n\nThe password should be: 7, 6, G, K\n\nLet's format the answer as requested: \n\n<<< [\"7\", \"6\", \"G\", \"K\"] >>>"
