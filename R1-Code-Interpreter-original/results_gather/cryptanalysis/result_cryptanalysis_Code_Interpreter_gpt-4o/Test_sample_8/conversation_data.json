    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 97EJ**\n   - Both numbers (9 and 7) are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 43OM**\n   - Both numbers (4 and 3) are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (O and M) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 20BQ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The numbers must be less than 4, as all numbers in the guesses are too large.\n- From the third guess, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is too large. This means one of the numbers is 0 or 2, but not in the correct position.\n- The letters must be earlier in the alphabet than B, O, M, and Q.\n- From the first guess, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. From the third guess, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. This means one of the letters is E or J, but not in the correct position.\n\nLet's deduce the correct password.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible numbers are less than 4, so they are 0, 1, 2, 3\n# Possible letters are earlier than B, O, M, Q, so they are A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n\n# From the analysis:\n# - One of the numbers is 0 or 2, but not in the correct position in guess 3.\n# - The other number must be 1 or 3, since 4 is too large.\n# - One of the letters is E or J, but not in the correct position in guess 1.\n# - The other letter must be A, C, D, F, G, H, I, or K.\n\n# Let's try to deduce the correct combination\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters\npossible_numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3]\npossible_letters = ['A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K']\n\n# Check all permutations of two numbers and two letters\nfor num_perm in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for letter_perm in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        # Construct the guess\n        guess = [str(num_perm[0]), str(num_perm[1]), letter_perm[0], letter_perm[1]]\n        \n        # Check conditions\n        # Condition 1: 97EJ\n        if (num_perm[0] >= 9 or num_perm[1] >= 9) or \\\n           (letter_perm[0] not in ['E', 'J'] and letter_perm[1] not in ['E', 'J']):\n            continue\n        \n        # Condition 2: 43OM\n        if (num_perm[0] >= 4 or num_perm[1] >= 4) or \\\n           (letter_perm[0] in ['O', 'M'] or letter_perm[1] in ['O', 'M']):\n            continue\n        \n        # Condition 3: 20BQ\n        if (num_perm[0] == 2 and num_perm[1] == 0) or \\\n           (num_perm[0] > 2 and num_perm[1] > 2) or \\\n           (letter_perm[0] in ['B', 'Q'] or letter_perm[1] in ['B', 'Q']):\n            continue\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, this is the correct password\n        correct_password = guess\n        break\n\ncorrect_password\nassistant > The correct password is \\(\\texttt{[\"3\", \"2\", \"A\", \"E\"]}\\)."
