    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 49EK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 03KE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 05OP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 28JC**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 98XJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 37XW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are correct but in the wrong positions.\n\nFrom the feedback, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The numbers 4, 9, 0, 3, 5, 8, and 7 are incorrect.\n- From guess 4, one of the numbers 2 or 8 is correct, but 8 is too large (as per guess 5), so 2 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 5, both numbers 9 and 8 are too large, so the numbers must be smaller than 8.\n- From guess 6, both numbers 3 and 7 are incorrect, so the numbers must be 2 and another number smaller than 8 and not 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9. The only possibility is 6.\n\n- The letters E, K, O, P, J, and C are incorrect.\n- From guess 5, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early. Since J is incorrect, X is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 6, both letters X and W are correct but in the wrong positions.\n\nThus, the correct combination is:\n\n- Numbers: 6 and 2\n- Letters: W and X\n\nThe correct password is <<< [\"6\", \"2\", \"W\", \"X\"] >>>."
