    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 48TY**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 61LS**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 21KP**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From guess 2, numbers 6 and 1 are incorrect, and letters L and S are incorrect.\n- From guess 3, number 2 is correct and in the correct position, and number 1 is incorrect and too small.\n- From guess 1, number 4 is correct but in the wrong position, and number 8 is incorrect and too large.\n- From guess 1, letter T is correct but in the wrong position, and letter Y is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n- From guess 3, letter K is correct but in the wrong position, and letter P is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nBased on these deductions, let's determine the correct password:\n\n- The correct numbers are 2 and 4. Since 2 is in the correct position in guess 3, the number sequence is [2, 4].\n- The correct letters are T and K. Since T is in the wrong position in guess 1, and K is in the wrong position in guess 3, the letter sequence is [K, T].\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n\\[ \\text{[\"2\", \"4\", \"K\", \"T\"]} \\]"
