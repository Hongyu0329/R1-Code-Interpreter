    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 1: 8 and 0 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2: 5 is correct but in the wrong position; 8 is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 3: 1 and 3 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4: 3 and 6 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5: 7 is correct but in the wrong position; 5 is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 6: 4 and 6 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7: 0 is correct but in the wrong position; 5 is incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 8: 0 is correct and in the correct position; 5 is incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 9: 9 and 6 are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 10: 4 is correct and in the correct position; 5 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 11: 6 and 4 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 12: 3 and 1 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 13: 0 and 3 are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, we deduce:\n   - The correct numbers are 0 and 7.\n   - 0 is in the first position, and 7 is in the second position.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1: Y and C are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2: L and T are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3: Q and W are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4: I and L are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5: C is correct and in the correct position; F is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 6: K and W are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7: G and D are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8: L and X are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9: S and G are incorrect.\n   - From guess 10: X and I are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11: D is correct and in the correct position; F is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 12: S and E are incorrect.\n   - From guess 13: L is correct but in the wrong position; Z is incorrect.\n\n   From the above, we deduce:\n   - The correct letters are C and D.\n   - C is in the third position, and D is in the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<< [\"0\", \"7\", \"C\", \"D\"] >>>}\n\\]"
