    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and use the process of elimination to determine the correct numbers and letters.\n\nLet's break down the feedback:\n\n1. **Guess: 56QS**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 47KB**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 83CN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 35JX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 95FG**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n### Analyzing the Numbers:\n\n- From guess 2, numbers 4 and 7 are incorrect.\n- From guess 3, number 8 is correct but in the wrong position, and number 3 is incorrect and too small.\n- From guess 4, number 5 is correct but in the wrong position, and number 3 is incorrect and too small.\n- From guess 5, number 9 is correct but in the wrong position, and number 5 is incorrect and too large.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- The correct numbers are 8 and 9, with 8 in the second position and 9 in the first position.\n\n### Analyzing the Letters:\n\n- From guess 1, letters Q and S are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n- From guess 2, letters K and B are incorrect.\n- From guess 3, letter C is correct but in the wrong position, and letter N is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n- From guess 4, letters J and X are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n- From guess 5, letter F is correct but in the wrong position, and letter G is incorrect.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- The correct letters are C and F, with C in the fourth position and F in the third position.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correct password is 98FC. Let's format it as requested:\n\n<<< [\"9\", \"8\", \"F\", \"C\"] >>>"
