    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 16TE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 72QY**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 23AX**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 71KQ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 91TW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 51PL**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nLet's deduce the numbers and letters step by step:\n\n### Numbers:\n- From Guess 1, 16 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 5, 91 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 6, 51 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 2, 72: one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 1, 5, and 6 are incorrect, 7 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 3, 23: one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 1, 5, and 6 are incorrect, 3 is correct and in the correct position.\n\nThus, the numbers are 7 and 3.\n\n### Letters:\n- From Guess 1, TE are incorrect.\n- From Guess 2, QY: one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect. Since Q is incorrect in Guess 4, Y is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From Guess 3, AX are incorrect.\n- From Guess 4, KQ are incorrect.\n- From Guess 5, TW are incorrect.\n- From Guess 6, PL: one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since L is later in the alphabet than P, L is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nThus, the letters are Y and L.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct password is 73 with letters Y and L. Let's format the answer:\n\n\\[ \\text{Password:} \\, \\text{[\"7\", \"3\", \"L\", \"Y\"]} \\]"
