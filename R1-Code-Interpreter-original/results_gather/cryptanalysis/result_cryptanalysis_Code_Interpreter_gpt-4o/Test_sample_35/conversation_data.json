    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, let's analyze the feedback from each guess:\n\n1. **Guess: 14LZ**\n   - Both numbers (1 and 4) are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters (L and Z) are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 28EP**\n   - Both numbers (2 and 8) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (P) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter (E) is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 14RW**\n   - Both numbers (1 and 4) are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters (R and W) are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 70XH**\n   - Both numbers (7 and 0) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (H) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter (X) is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the feedback, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The correct numbers are 1 and 4, but they need to be swapped from their positions in the guesses.\n- The correct letters are P and H, with P in the second position and H in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct password should be:\n\n- The numbers 4 and 1 (swapped from their positions in the guesses).\n- The letters P and H (with P in the second position and H in the fourth position).\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<< [\"4\", \"1\", \"P\", \"H\"] >>>}\n\\]"
