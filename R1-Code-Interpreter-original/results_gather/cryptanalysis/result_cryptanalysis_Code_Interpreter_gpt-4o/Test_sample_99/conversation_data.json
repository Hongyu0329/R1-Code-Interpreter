    "\nassistant > To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from each guess and eliminate possibilities based on the given conditions.\n\n### Analyzing the Conditions:\n\n1. **Guess: 87VX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 26AP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 98ZT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 98HL**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 93BN**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 37CG**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n7. **Guess: 17KW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n8. **Guess: 92XC**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n9. **Guess: 30NX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n10. **Guess: 74DJ**\n    - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n    - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n### Deductions:\n\n- From guesses 1, 2, 6, and 7, we know that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 are incorrect.\n- From guess 9, we know that 0 is too small.\n- From guess 10, we know that 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 3, 4, and 5, we know that 9 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 5, we know that 3 is incorrect and too small, confirming 9 is correct.\n- From guess 8, we know that 2 is incorrect and too small, confirming 9 is correct.\n\n- From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10, we know that the letters V, X, A, P, Z, T, B, N, K, W, D, and J are incorrect.\n- From guess 4, we know that H is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 6, we know that C and G are too early, confirming H is correct.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correct password is 94HL.\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n```python\npassword = [\"9\", \"4\", \"H\", \"L\"]\npassword\n```\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# The deduced password based on the analysis\npassword = [\"9\", \"4\", \"H\", \"L\"]\npassword\nassistant > The correct password is <<< [\"9\", \"4\", \"H\", \"L\"] >>>."
