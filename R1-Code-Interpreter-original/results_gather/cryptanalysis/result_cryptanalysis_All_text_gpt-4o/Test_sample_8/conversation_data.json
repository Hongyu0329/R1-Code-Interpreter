    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 97EJ**\n   - Both numbers (9 and 7) are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 43OM**\n   - Both numbers (4 and 3) are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (O and M) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 20BQ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Numbers:**\n  - From guess 97EJ, numbers 9 and 7 are too large.\n  - From guess 43OM, numbers 4 and 3 are too large.\n  - From guess 20BQ, number 2 is correct but in the wrong position, and number 0 is incorrect and too large.\n  - Therefore, the possible numbers are 1 and 2, since they are the only numbers less than 3.\n\n- **Letters:**\n  - From guess 97EJ, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect.\n  - From guess 43OM, both letters O and M are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n  - From guess 20BQ, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n  - Since O, M, and Q are too late, the possible letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, P.\n  - From guess 97EJ, E or J is correct but in the wrong position. Since J is too late (after I), E is the correct letter.\n  - From guess 20BQ, B is correct but in the wrong position, and Q is too late.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The numbers are 1 and 2, with 2 in the second position (from guess 20BQ).\n- The letters are B and E, with B in the third position (from guess 20BQ).\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"1\", \"2\", \"B\", \"E\"] >>>"
