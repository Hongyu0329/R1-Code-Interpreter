    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1: Guess 80YF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Condition 2: Guess 50MH**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Guess 14TD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Condition 4: Guess 76MO**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Condition 5: Guess 09ZV**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Condition 1, we know that 8, 0, Y, and F are not part of the password.\n- From Condition 2, since one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small, the correct number must be 5. The incorrect number is 0, which is too small, so the other number must be larger than 5. Both letters M and H are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n- From Condition 3, both numbers 1 and 4 are too small, so the numbers must be greater than 4. Both letters T and D are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n- From Condition 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 5 is already identified as a correct number from Condition 2, the correct number in this condition must be 6. The incorrect number 7 is too large, so the other number must be less than 7. Both letters M and O are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n- From Condition 5, both numbers 0 and 9 are incorrect, and both letters Z and V are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The numbers must be 5 and 6, with 5 in the first position and 6 in the second position.\n- The letters must be Z and V, with Z in the third position and V in the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"5\", \"6\", \"Z\", \"V\"] >>>"
