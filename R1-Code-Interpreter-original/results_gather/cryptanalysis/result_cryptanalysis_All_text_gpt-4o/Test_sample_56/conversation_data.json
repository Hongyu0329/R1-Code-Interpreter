    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 93YW**\n   - Both numbers (9, 3) are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - Both letters (Y, W) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 34PL**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters (P, L) are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 14YH**\n   - Both numbers (1, 4) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (Y, H) are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 70FZ**\n   - Both numbers (7, 0) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (F, Z) are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 46GK**\n   - Both numbers (4, 6) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (G, K) is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n6. **Guess: 32RP**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters (R, P) are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 63VH**\n   - One number (3) is correct and in the correct position; one number (6) is incorrect.\n   - Both letters (V, H) are incorrect.\n\n8. **Guess: 13NC**\n   - One number (3) is correct and in the correct position; one number (1) is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters (N, C) are incorrect.\n\n9. **Guess: 61BE**\n   - Both numbers (6, 1) are incorrect.\n   - Both letters (B, E) are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n10. **Guess: 43KU**\n    - One number (3) is correct and in the correct position; one number (4) is incorrect.\n    - One letter (K, U) is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From guesses 1 and 7, we know that 9 and 3 are the correct numbers and in the correct positions.\n- From guess 1, letters Y and W are too late in the alphabet, so the correct letters must be earlier.\n- From guess 5, one of the letters G or K is correct but in the wrong position. Since K is mentioned again in guess 10 and is correct but in the wrong position, K must be one of the letters.\n- From guess 10, K is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be the first letter.\n- From guess 9, letters B and E are too early in the alphabet, so the correct letter must be later than E.\n- From guess 10, U is incorrect, so the other letter must be later than E but not U.\n- From guess 5, G is incorrect, so the other letter must be later than G.\n\nConsidering all these points, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"9\", \"3\", \"K\", \"J\"] >>>"
