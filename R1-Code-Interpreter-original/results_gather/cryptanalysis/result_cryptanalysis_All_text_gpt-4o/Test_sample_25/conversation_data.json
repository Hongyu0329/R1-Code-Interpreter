    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Condition 1: Guess 91SF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 9 and 1 are not in the password.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: Either S or F is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect: Either S or F is incorrect.\n\n2. **Condition 2: Guess 03HF**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: Either 0 or 3 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small: The incorrect number is smaller than the correct number.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: H and F are not in the password.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Guess 75CP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 7 and 5 are not in the password.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: Either C or P is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect: Either C or P is incorrect.\n\n4. **Condition 4: Guess 64YB**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: Either 6 or 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect: Either 6 or 4 is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Y and B are not in the password.\n\n**Step-by-step deduction:**\n\n- From Condition 1, since both numbers 9 and 1 are incorrect, the numbers must be from 0, 3, 6, or 4.\n- From Condition 2, since one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too small, the correct number must be 3 (since 0 is too small).\n- From Condition 4, since one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect, the correct number must be 6 (since 4 is incorrect).\n- Therefore, the numbers are 6 and 3, with 6 in the first position and 3 in the second position.\n\n- From Condition 1, since one letter is correct and in the correct position, and F is incorrect (from Condition 2), S must be correct and in the correct position.\n- From Condition 3, since one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and P is incorrect (from Condition 1), C must be correct but in the wrong position.\n- Therefore, the letters are S and C, with S in the third position and C in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the password is:\n\n<<< [\"6\", \"3\", \"S\", \"C\"] >>>"
