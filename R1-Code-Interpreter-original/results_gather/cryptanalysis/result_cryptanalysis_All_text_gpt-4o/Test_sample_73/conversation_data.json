    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, we know that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 2 is incorrect (from other guesses), 8 must be correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 13, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect. Since 8 is correct from guess 4, 6 must be incorrect, confirming 8 is in the first position.\n   - From guess 9, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect. Since 8 is correct in the first position, 7 is incorrect, confirming 5 is the correct number in the second position.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since S is correct in the first position, E is incorrect.\n   - From guess 2, both letters are incorrect, confirming O and X are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming L and J are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming H and I are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming L and J are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, both letters are incorrect, confirming W and F are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since S is correct from guess 1, I is incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, both letters are incorrect, confirming Y and B are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, both letters are incorrect, confirming W and E are incorrect.\n   - From guess 10, both letters are incorrect, confirming Y and P are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11, both letters are incorrect, confirming U and L are incorrect.\n   - From guess 12, both letters are incorrect, confirming V and F are incorrect.\n   - From guess 13, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since Q is incorrect, G is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n3. **Final Deduction:**\n   - The correct numbers are 8 and 5, with 8 in the first position and 5 in the second position.\n   - The correct letters are S and G, with S in the third position and G in the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"5\", \"S\", \"G\"] >>>"
