    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 56QS**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 5 or 6 is correct and in the correct position. Both Q and S are incorrect and too late, so the letters must be earlier in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 47KB**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 4 and 7 are not in the password. Letters K and B are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 83CN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Number 8 or 3 is correct but in the wrong position. Number 3 is too small. Letter C is correct but in the wrong position. Letter N is incorrect and too late.\n\n4. **Guess: 35JX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Number 3 is incorrect and too small. Number 5 is correct but in the wrong position. Letters J and X are incorrect and too late.\n\n5. **Guess: 95FG**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Number 9 is incorrect and too large. Number 5 is correct but in the wrong position. Letter F is correct but in the wrong position. Letter G is incorrect.\n\n**Deductions:**\n- From guesses 1 and 5, number 5 is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be the second number.\n- From guess 3, number 8 is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be the first number.\n- From guess 3, letter C is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be the second letter.\n- From guess 5, letter F is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be the first letter.\n\n**Final Password:**\n- Numbers: 8 and 5\n- Letters: F and C\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"5\", \"F\", \"C\"] >>>"
