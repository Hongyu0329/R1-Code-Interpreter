    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (65HO): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This means one of 6 or 5 is correct but misplaced, and the other is incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 2 (47IM): Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 3 (10GI): Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 4 (70XG): Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 5 (12JU): Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 6 (52SZ): Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 7 (64AV): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 8 (85BO): One number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 9 (98RX): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 10 (60JU): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 11 (75UC): Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 12 (79NC): Both numbers are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are too small.\n   - Numbers 9 is too large.\n   - Numbers 4, 5, 7 are incorrect.\n   - Number 8 is correct and in the correct position (from Guess 8).\n   - Number 9 is incorrect in Guess 12, so the correct number from Guess 9 is 8, but in the wrong position.\n\n   Therefore, the numbers are 8 and 0.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (65HO): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 2 (47IM): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 3 (10GI): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 4 (70XG): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 5 (12JU): One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 6 (52SZ): Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 7 (64AV): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 8 (85BO): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 9 (98RX): Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 10 (60JU): One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 11 (75UC): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 12 (79NC): One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - Letters H, O, I, M, G, X, S, Z, V, B, R are incorrect.\n   - Letter J is correct and in the correct position (from Guess 5 and 10).\n   - Letter U is incorrect (from Guess 11).\n   - Letter N is correct but in the wrong position (from Guess 12).\n\n   Therefore, the letters are J and N.\n\nCombining the numbers and letters, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"0\", \"J\", \"N\"] >>>"
