    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **From Guess 1 (37ZI):**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Possible correct numbers: 3 or 7.\n\n2. **From Guess 2 (74VH):**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Possible correct numbers: 4 or 7.\n\n3. **From Guess 3 (39SX):**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Possible correct letter: S.\n\n4. **From Guess 4 (67GU):**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Possible correct numbers: 6 or 7.\n\n5. **From Guess 5 (86AP):**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Possible correct letter: A.\n\n6. **From Guess 6 (80LC):**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Eliminate numbers 8 and 0, and letters L and C.\n\n7. **From Guess 7 (38XZ):**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Possible correct letter: X (but not in the correct position).\n\n8. **From Guess 8 (96WO):**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Eliminate numbers 9 and 6, and letters W and O.\n\n9. **From Guess 9 (87BK):**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Possible correct number: 7.\n\n10. **From Guess 10 (84WL):**\n    - Both numbers are incorrect.\n    - Both letters are incorrect.\n    - Eliminate numbers 8 and 4, and letters W and L.\n\n11. **From Guess 11 (72NV):**\n    - Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions.\n    - Both letters are incorrect.\n    - Possible correct numbers: 2 and 7.\n\n**Deducing the numbers:**\n- From the analysis, the numbers 2 and 7 are correct.\n- From Guess 11, 2 and 7 are in the wrong positions, so the correct order is 7 and 2.\n\n**Deducing the letters:**\n- From Guess 3, S is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 5, A is correct and in the correct position.\n\nThus, the password is 72SA.\n\nThe final answer is: <<< [\"7\", \"2\", \"S\", \"A\"] >>>"
