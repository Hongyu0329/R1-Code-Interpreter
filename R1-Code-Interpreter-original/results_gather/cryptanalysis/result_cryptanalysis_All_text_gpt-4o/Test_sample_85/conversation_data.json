    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, we know that 8, 6, 9, 3, 1, 5, 0, and 7 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is incorrect, 2 must be correct and in the first position.\n   - From guess 6, one number is correct and in the correct position, confirming 2 is correct in the first position.\n   - From guess 11, one number is correct and in the correct position, confirming 4 is correct in the second position.\n   - Therefore, the numbers are 2 and 4.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12, we know that A, F, L, X, K, T, M, J, V, Q, I, C, O, E, Z, and Q are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect. Since K is incorrect, W must be correct and in the fourth position.\n   - From guess 13, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect. Since W is correct in the fourth position, D must be correct and in the third position.\n\nCombining the analysis, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"4\", \"D\", \"W\"] >>>"
