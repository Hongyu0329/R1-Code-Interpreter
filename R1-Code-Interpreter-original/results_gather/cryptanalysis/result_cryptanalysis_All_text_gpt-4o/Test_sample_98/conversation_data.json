    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guess 10 (48QW), both numbers are correct and in the correct positions. Therefore, the numbers are 4 and 8.\n   - From guess 5 (86YC), one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 8 is in the second position in guess 10, it must be 4 that is correct but in the wrong position in guess 5.\n   - From guess 9 (54WB), one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 4 is in the first position in guess 10, it must be 8 that is correct but in the wrong position in guess 9.\n   - Therefore, the correct numbers are 4 and 8, with 4 in the first position and 8 in the second position.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guess 10 (48QW), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (86YC), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since C is too early, Y is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 8 (87ZL), both letters are incorrect, confirming that Z and L are not part of the password.\n   - From guess 11 (86UT), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that U and T are not part of the password.\n   - From guess 5 (86YC), Y is correct and in the correct position, so Y is the third letter.\n   - From guess 5 (86YC), C is incorrect and too early, so the fourth letter must be later in the alphabet than C.\n   - From guess 1 (75QG), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that Q and G are not part of the password.\n   - From guess 2 (30KJ), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that K and J are not part of the password.\n   - From guess 3 (97KP), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that K and P are not part of the password.\n   - From guess 6 (91MS), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that M and S are not part of the password.\n   - From guess 7 (31WR), both letters are incorrect, confirming that W and R are not part of the password.\n   - The only letter left that is later in the alphabet than C and not already eliminated is D.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"8\", \"Y\", \"D\"] >>>"
