    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1: Guess 03OQ**\n   - Both numbers (0, 3) are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters (O, Q) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Condition 2: Guess 76EC**\n   - Both numbers (7, 6) are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (E, C) are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Guess 83FO**\n   - Both numbers (8, 3) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (F or O) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter (F or O) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Condition 4: Guess 47OF**\n   - One number (4 or 7) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number (4 or 7) is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter (O or F) is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter (O or F) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Condition 5: Guess 87LK**\n   - Both numbers (8, 7) are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter (L or K) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter (L or K) is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From conditions 1 and 2, the numbers must be between 4 and 5 (since 0, 3 are too small and 6, 7, 8 are too large).\n- From condition 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too large. Since 7 is too large, 4 must be correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 4, the other number must be smaller than 7, so it must be 5.\n- From conditions 1 and 2, the letters must be between F and L (since O, Q are too late and E, C are too early).\n- From condition 3, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since O is too late, F must be correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 4, one letter is correct but in the wrong position. Since F is in the correct position in condition 3, O must be the incorrect letter, and the correct letter must be in the wrong position.\n- From condition 5, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since L is too late, K must be correct and in the correct position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The numbers are 4 and 5.\n- The letters are F and K, with F in the third position and K in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"5\", \"F\", \"K\"] >>>"
