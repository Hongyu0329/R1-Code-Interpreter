    "To deduce the correct password, let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 20KJ**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect and too small; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers must be greater than 2 and 0. The letters cannot be K or J.\n\n2. **Guess: 60SC**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: \n     - One of the numbers 6 or 0 is correct. Since 0 is too small (from the first guess), 6 is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - The other number must be greater than 6.\n     - One of the letters S or C is correct but in the wrong position. Since C is incorrect (from the feedback), S is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n3. **Guess: 39OQ**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion:\n     - One of the numbers 3 or 9 is correct and in the correct position. Since 9 is too large (from the feedback), 3 is correct and in the correct position.\n     - The other number must be less than 9.\n     - The letters O and Q are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 09BV**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion:\n     - Since 0 is too small and 9 is too large, the numbers must be between 1 and 8.\n     - One of the letters B or V is correct and in the correct position. Since V is too late in the alphabet, B is correct and in the correct position.\n\n**Combining the conclusions:**\n- From the numbers, 3 is correct and in the first position. The second number must be greater than 6 and less than 9, which leaves 7 or 8. Since 6 is correct but in the wrong position, the second number must be 7.\n- From the letters, S is correct but in the wrong position, and B is correct and in the correct position. Therefore, the letters are B and S, with B in the third position and S in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"3\", \"7\", \"B\", \"S\"] >>>"
