    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we know that the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, one number is correct and in the correct position. The numbers are 5 and 4, but since 5 is incorrect (from previous analysis), 4 must be correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 9, one number is correct and in the correct position. The numbers are 7 and 4, but since 7 is incorrect (from previous analysis), 4 is confirmed correct and in the correct position.\n   - Therefore, the correct numbers are 4 and another number not yet identified.\n   - The remaining possible numbers are 9 (since 0-8 are eliminated).\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1, both letters T and V are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 2, both letters L and C are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, both letters Z and T are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 4, both letters M and J are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, both letters R and E are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, both letters N and C are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, both letters G and B are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect. The letters are D and I. Since D is incorrect (from previous analysis), I must be correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 9, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. The letters are V and O. Since V is incorrect (from previous analysis), O must be correct but in the wrong position.\n   - Therefore, the correct letters are I and O, but their positions need to be swapped.\n\n3. **Final Deduction:**\n   - The correct numbers are 4 and 9, with 4 in the first position.\n   - The correct letters are I and O, with I in the second position and O in the third position.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"9\", \"I\", \"O\"] >>>"
