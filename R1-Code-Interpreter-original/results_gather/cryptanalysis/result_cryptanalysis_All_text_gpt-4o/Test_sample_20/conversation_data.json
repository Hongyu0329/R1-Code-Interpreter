    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1: Guess 35PQ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   \n   From this, we know:\n   - Either 3 or 5 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The incorrect number is too large, so it must be 5 (since 3 is smaller).\n   - Both P and Q are incorrect and too late, so the correct letters are before P and Q in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Condition 2: Guess 24XE**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   \n   From this, we know:\n   - Either 2 or 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The incorrect number is too small, so it must be 2 (since 4 is larger).\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position, which must be X.\n   - E is incorrect and too late, so the correct letter is before E in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Guess 96SQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   \n   From this, we know:\n   - Neither 9 nor 6 is correct, and both are too large.\n   - Both S and Q are incorrect and too late, confirming that the correct letters are before S and Q.\n\n4. **Condition 4: Guess 25XC**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   \n   From this, we know:\n   - Neither 2 nor 5 is correct.\n   - X is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - C is incorrect and too late, so the correct letter is before C in the alphabet.\n\n**Deducing the Password:**\n\n- From the number analysis:\n  - The correct numbers are 3 and 4, with 3 in the first position (from Condition 1) and 4 in the second position (from Condition 2).\n\n- From the letter analysis:\n  - X is correct and must be in the second letter position (from Condition 4).\n  - The first letter must be before C in the alphabet and before E (from Condition 2), so it must be A or B.\n  - Since A is the only letter before C and E, the first letter is A.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"3\", \"4\", \"A\", \"X\"] >>>"
