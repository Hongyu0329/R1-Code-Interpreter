    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (79FV): Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 2 (32PZ): Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 3 (09EF): Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 4 (58QD): One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 5 (79OJ): Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 6 (64LY): One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 7 (48HI): One number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 8 (45TG): Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - From Guess 9 (31IB): Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 10 (94VW): One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 11 (70XN): Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 12 (70BI): Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 13 (89UG): Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 14 (70KG): Both numbers are incorrect.\n\n   From the above analysis, the only numbers that fit all conditions are 4 and 5, as confirmed by Guess 8.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (79FV): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 2 (32PZ): Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 3 (09EF): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 4 (58QD): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 5 (79OJ): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 6 (64LY): One letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 7 (48HI): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 8 (45TG): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 9 (31IB): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 10 (94VW): Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 11 (70XN): Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 12 (70BI): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 13 (89UG): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 14 (70KG): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From the above analysis, the only letters that fit all conditions are L and Y, as confirmed by Guess 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"5\", \"L\", \"Y\"] >>>"
