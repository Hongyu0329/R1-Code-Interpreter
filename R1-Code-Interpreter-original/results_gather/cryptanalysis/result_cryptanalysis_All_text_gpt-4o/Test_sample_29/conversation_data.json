    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 74JY**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 93ZN**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 26MU**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 57FS**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Guess 2, numbers 9 and 3 are incorrect. Therefore, the correct numbers must be from 0-8, excluding 2, 6, 7, and 4 (from other feedbacks).\n- From Guess 3, numbers 2 and 6 are incorrect and too small, so the correct numbers must be greater than 6.\n- From Guess 4, number 5 is correct but in the wrong position, and number 7 is incorrect and too small. Therefore, the correct numbers are 5 and a number greater than 7, which is 8.\n- From Guess 1, number 4 is incorrect and too small, confirming that the correct numbers are 5 and 8.\n\n- From Guess 2, letters Z and N are incorrect.\n- From Guess 3, letters M and U are incorrect.\n- From Guess 4, letter F is correct and in the correct position, and letter S is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n- From Guess 1, letter J is correct but in the wrong position, and letter Y is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The correct numbers are 5 and 8.\n- The correct letters are F and J.\n- From Guess 4, F is in the correct position, so it must be the third position.\n- From Guess 1, J is in the wrong position, so it must be the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"5\", \"F\", \"J\"] >>>"
