    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 25KS**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers 2 and 5, and the letters K and S are not part of the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 26BP**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: \n     - The numbers 2 and 6 are not part of the password.\n     - One of the letters B or P is correct but in the wrong position. \n     - Since P is too late in the alphabet, B must be the correct letter in the wrong position.\n\n3. **Guess: 39ON**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too small; one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion:\n     - One of the numbers 3 or 9 is correct but in the wrong position. Since 3 is too small, 9 must be the correct number in the wrong position.\n     - One of the letters O or N is correct but in the wrong position. Since N is too late in the alphabet, O must be the correct letter in the wrong position.\n\n**Combining the Information:**\n- From the numbers, we know:\n  - 2, 3, 5, and 6 are incorrect.\n  - 9 is correct but in the wrong position.\n  - The other number must be greater than 3 and not 6, so it could be 4, 7, or 8.\n\n- From the letters, we know:\n  - K, S, and N are incorrect.\n  - B is correct but in the wrong position.\n  - O is correct but in the wrong position.\n  - P is incorrect and too late in the alphabet, so the other letter must be earlier than P.\n\n**Determining the Correct Numbers:**\n- Since 9 is correct but in the wrong position, it must be the second number.\n- The first number must be 4, 7, or 8. Since 3 is too small, the first number is likely 8.\n\n**Determining the Correct Letters:**\n- B and O are correct but in the wrong positions.\n- Since B is in the wrong position in the second guess, it must be the second letter.\n- O is in the wrong position in the third guess, so it must be the first letter.\n\n**Final Password:**\n- The correct combination is 8, 9, O, B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<< [\"8\", \"9\", \"O\", \"B\"] >>>"
