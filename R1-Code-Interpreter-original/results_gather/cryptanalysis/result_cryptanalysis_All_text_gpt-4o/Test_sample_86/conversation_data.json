    "To deduce the correct password, let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 14VM**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Either 1 or 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number is greater than the incorrect number.\n   - V and M are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 91UE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - 9 and 1 are not in the password.\n   - U and E are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 85FO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - 8 and 5 are not in the password.\n   - F and O are not in the password.\n\n4. **Guess: 05QJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - 0 and 5 are not in the password.\n   - Either Q or J is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n5. **Guess: 85ZQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Z and Q are not in the password.\n\n6. **Guess: 95WT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - W and T are not in the password.\n   - The correct letters are earlier in the alphabet than W and T.\n\n7. **Guess: 57KR**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - K and R are not in the password.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n- From the numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, we know 1, 5, 8, 9 are incorrect. 0 and 5 are incorrect from guess 4. Therefore, the possible numbers are 2, 3, 6, 7.\n- From guess 1, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 1 is incorrect, 4 must be correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, 0 and 5 are incorrect, so the numbers must be 4 and 6.\n- From the letters, V, M, U, E, F, O, Z, Q, W, T, K, R are incorrect. The only remaining letters are A, B, C, D, G, H, I, L, N, P, S.\n- From guess 4, one letter is correct but in the wrong position. Since Q is incorrect, J must be correct but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 6, the letters are earlier in the alphabet than W and T. Therefore, J is correct, and the other letter must be earlier than J.\n- The only letter earlier than J that hasn't been ruled out is A, B, C, D, G, H, I.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe password is <<< [\"4\", \"6\", \"J\", \"A\"] >>>."
