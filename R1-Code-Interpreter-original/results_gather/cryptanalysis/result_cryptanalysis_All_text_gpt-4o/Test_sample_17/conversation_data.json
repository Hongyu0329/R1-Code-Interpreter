    "To deduce the correct password, let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 10PL**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Either '1' or '0' is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other number is incorrect and too small, so it must be greater than '1' or '0'.\n   - 'P' and 'L' are incorrect and too early, so the correct letters are after 'P' and 'L' in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 98QX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - The numbers must be less than '9' and '8'.\n   - Either 'Q' or 'X' is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other letter is incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 10KL**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Reinforces that either '1' or '0' is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other number is incorrect and too small, so it must be greater than '1' or '0'.\n   - 'K' and 'L' are incorrect and too early, so the correct letters are after 'K' and 'L' in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 16NY**\n   - Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - '1' and '6' are the correct numbers but need to be swapped.\n   - 'N' and 'Y' are incorrect.\n\n**Deducing the correct password:**\n\n- From the number analysis:\n  - '1' and '6' are the correct numbers, with '1' in the second position and '6' in the first position.\n\n- From the letter analysis:\n  - 'Q' is correct and in the correct position from the second guess, so it must be the third position.\n  - The other letter must be after 'X' in the alphabet and not 'N' or 'Y'. The next possible letter is 'Z'.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"6\", \"1\", \"Q\", \"Z\"] >>>"
