    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 71HT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 19ZS**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 48PA**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 49FO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 25IP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 76KR**\n   - Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 17BY**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n8. **Guess: 31ZP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n9. **Guess: 02NE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n10. **Guess: 36ZF**\n    - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One number is incorrect and too small.\n    - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n11. **Guess: 26SR**\n    - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One number is incorrect and too small.\n    - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n    - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n12. **Guess: 65FG**\n    - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n    - One number is incorrect and too small.\n    - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From guess 6, we know the numbers are 7 and 6, and they are in the correct positions.\n- From guess 1, since one number is correct and in the correct position, and 7 is in the first position, 7 is correct.\n- From guess 6, both numbers are correct and in the correct positions, confirming 7 and 6.\n- From guess 2, both letters are incorrect and too late, so Z and S are not in the password.\n- From guess 6, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. Since R is incorrect in guess 11, K must be correct.\n- From guess 12, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too early. Since F is incorrect in guess 4, G must be correct.\n- From guess 6, K is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be the second letter.\n- From guess 12, G is correct and in the correct position, so it must be the fourth letter.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe password is 76KG.\n\nFinal answer: <<< [\"7\", \"6\", \"K\", \"G\"] >>>"
