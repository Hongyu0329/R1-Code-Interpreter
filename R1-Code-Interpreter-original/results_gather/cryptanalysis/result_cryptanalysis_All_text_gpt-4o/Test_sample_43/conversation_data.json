    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 61OJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 98QN**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 58FC**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 72YK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 02ER**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 35QW**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 71KJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n8. **Guess: 79PX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n9. **Guess: 86TV**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-step deduction:**\n\n- From guesses 1, 4, and 7, we know that 1, 2, 6, and 7 are incorrect numbers.\n- From guess 5, 0 is too small, so the numbers must be 3, 4, 5, 8, or 9.\n- From guess 2, 9 is too large, so the numbers must be 3, 4, 5, or 8.\n- From guess 3, 5 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 6, 3 is correct and in the correct position.\n- Therefore, the numbers are 3 and 5.\n\n- From guesses 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, the letters O, J, Q, N, F, C, E, R, K, and J are incorrect.\n- From guess 8, P is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 9, T is correct and in the correct position.\n- Therefore, the letters are P and T.\n\n**Final password:**\n- Numbers: 3 and 5\n- Letters: P and T\n\nThe correct password is <<< [\"3\", \"5\", \"P\", \"T\"] >>>."
