    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the feedback from the two guesses step by step.\n\n### Analyzing the First Guess: 87ID\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - \"One number is correct but in the wrong position\": This means either 8 or 7 is in the password but not in the correct position.\n   - \"One number is incorrect and too large\": This means either 8 or 7 is not in the password and is too large. Since 8 is larger than 7, 8 is likely the incorrect number.\n   - Conclusion: 7 is in the password but not in the first position.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - \"One letter is correct but in the wrong position\": This means either I or D is in the password but not in the correct position.\n   - \"One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet\": This means either I or D is not in the password and is too early. Since I comes before D, I is likely the incorrect letter.\n   - Conclusion: D is in the password but not in the third position.\n\n### Analyzing the Second Guess: 50FH\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - \"Both numbers are incorrect and too small\": This means neither 5 nor 0 is in the password, and both are smaller than the correct numbers.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers in the password are greater than 5 and 0.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - \"One letter is correct but in the wrong position\": This means either F or H is in the password but not in the correct position.\n   - \"One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet\": This means either F or H is not in the password and is too early. Since F comes before H, F is likely the incorrect letter.\n   - Conclusion: H is in the password but not in the fourth position.\n\n### Deducing the Password:\n- From the first guess, we know 7 is in the password but not in the first position. From the second guess, the numbers must be greater than 5 and 0. Therefore, the possible numbers are 6, 7, 8, and 9. Since 8 is too large, the numbers are likely 6 and 7.\n- From the first guess, D is in the password but not in the third position. From the second guess, H is in the password but not in the fourth position.\n- Combining these, the possible positions for the numbers and letters are:\n  - Numbers: 6 and 7\n  - Letters: D and H\n\n### Final Arrangement:\n- Since 7 cannot be in the first position, it must be in the second position.\n- Since D cannot be in the third position, it must be in the fourth position.\n- Therefore, the arrangement is:\n  - First position: 6\n  - Second position: 7\n  - Third position: H\n  - Fourth position: D\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"6\", \"7\", \"H\", \"D\"] >>>"
