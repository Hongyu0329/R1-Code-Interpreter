    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze the given conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1: Guess 64RY**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - This means the numbers 6 and 4, and the letters R and Y are not part of the password.\n\n2. **Condition 2: Guess 51MB**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - This means the numbers 5 and 1, and the letters M and B are not part of the password.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Guess 29PV**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - This means the numbers 2 and 9, and the letters P and V are not part of the password.\n\n4. **Condition 4: Guess 71EW**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect; both letters are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - From the previous conditions, we know that the numbers 7 and 1 are not part of the password. Therefore, the correct number must be 0, 3, or 8 (since these are the only numbers left from 0-9 that haven't been ruled out).\n   - Both letters E and W are correct but in the wrong positions.\n\n**Deducing the Numbers:**\n- From the feedback of Condition 4, since one number is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect, we can deduce:\n  - The correct number is either 0, 3, or 8.\n  - Since 7 and 1 are incorrect, the correct number must be 0, 3, or 8.\n\n**Deducing the Letters:**\n- From Condition 4, both letters E and W are correct but in the wrong positions.\n- Therefore, the letters in the password are E and W.\n\n**Final Deduction:**\n- The numbers must be 0 and 3 (since 8 is not mentioned in any condition, it is less likely to be correct).\n- The letters are E and W, but they need to be swapped from their positions in Condition 4.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The correct password is a combination of the numbers 0 and 3, and the letters E and W, with E and W swapped from their positions in Condition 4.\n\nThe final answer is: <<< [\"0\", \"3\", \"W\", \"E\"] >>>"
