    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 13, we know that 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, 7, and 10, we know that 7 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, 11, and 12, we know that 0 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 14, 3 is incorrect, confirming 0 is correct.\n   - From guess 16, 2 is incorrect, confirming 0 is correct.\n   - From guess 5, 6 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, 9 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 10, 6 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 11, 9 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 12, 1 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 14, 3 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 15, 8 is incorrect.\n   - From guess 16, 2 is incorrect.\n   - Therefore, the numbers are 0 and 5.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15, we know that D, U, X, E, R, O, B, S, M, A, J, F, Y, H, and K are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2, I is correct but in the wrong position, and T is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7, Q is correct but in the wrong position, and T is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 8, P is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 16, V is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - Therefore, the letters are I and Q.\n\n3. **Position Analysis:**\n   - From guess 8, 0 is in the correct position.\n   - From guess 16, I is in the correct position.\n   - From guess 7, Q is in the wrong position, so it must be the second letter.\n\nCombining all the information, the password is:\n\n<<< [\"0\", \"5\", \"I\", \"Q\"] >>>"
