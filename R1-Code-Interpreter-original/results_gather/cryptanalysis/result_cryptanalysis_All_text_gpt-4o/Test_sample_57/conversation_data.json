    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 43HI**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 45QH**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 01ZA**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 64RO**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 92SB**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 46DY**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 81CM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From guesses 1 and 2, we know that one of the numbers 4 or 5 is correct but in the wrong position. Since 4 is in the correct position in guess 4, 4 is the correct number in the first position.\n- From guess 4, 6 is incorrect, so the second number is not 6.\n- From guess 5, 9 is correct and in the correct position, so the second number is 9.\n- From guess 3, both numbers 0 and 1 are too small, confirming that 4 and 9 are correct.\n- From guess 7, both numbers 8 and 1 are incorrect, confirming 4 and 9 are correct.\n\n- For the letters:\n  - From guess 3, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late. Since Z is too late, A is correct but in the wrong position.\n  - From guess 7, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect. Since C is incorrect, M is correct and in the correct position.\n  - From guess 3, A is correct but in the wrong position, so A must be the first letter.\n  - From guess 7, M is correct and in the correct position, so M is the second letter.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"9\", \"A\", \"M\"] >>>"
