    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 20VX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 73GA**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 13KM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 74CD**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 57GT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 32XO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 82EL**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n8. **Guess: 25DA**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n9. **Guess: 87WU**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n10. **Guess: 95ZM**\n    - Both numbers are incorrect.\n    - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From guesses 1, 3, and 6, numbers 1, 2, 3, and 0 are too small.\n- From guess 2, numbers 7 and 3 are incorrect.\n- From guess 5, numbers 5 and 7 are incorrect.\n- From guess 8, numbers 2 and 5 are incorrect.\n- From guess 10, numbers 9 and 5 are incorrect.\n\nThus, the possible numbers are 4, 6, and 8. \n\n- From guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 7 is incorrect, 4 is correct.\n- From guess 7, one number is correct and in the correct position. Since 2 is incorrect, 8 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the numbers are 84.\n\n- From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, letters V, X, G, A, K, M, C, D, E, L, and T are incorrect.\n- From guess 9, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since U is incorrect, W is correct.\n- From guess 10, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since M is incorrect, Z is correct.\n\nTherefore, the letters are W and Z.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<< [\"8\", \"4\", \"W\", \"Z\"] >>>"
