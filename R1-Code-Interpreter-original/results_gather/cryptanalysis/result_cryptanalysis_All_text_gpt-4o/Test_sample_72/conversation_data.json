    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (25WK), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 2 (98DR), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 3 (68AO), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 4 (25GA), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 5 (78LI), one number is correct and in the correct position; one number is incorrect and too large. This implies that the correct number is 7.\n   - From Guess 6 (05KA), one number is correct but in the wrong position. This implies that 0 is correct but not in the first position.\n   - From Guess 7 (29WH), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 8 (38QB), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 9 (72AY), one number is correct and in the correct position. This confirms that 7 is in the first position.\n   - From Guess 10 (45VW), both numbers are incorrect.\n\n   Conclusion for numbers: The numbers are 7 and 0, with 7 in the first position and 0 in the second position.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (25WK), one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This implies that either W or K is correct.\n   - From Guess 2 (98DR), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 3 (68AO), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 4 (25GA), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 5 (78LI), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 6 (05KA), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 7 (29WH), one letter is correct but in the wrong position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This implies that W is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From Guess 8 (38QB), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 9 (72AY), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 10 (45VW), both letters are correct and in the correct positions. This confirms that V and W are the correct letters.\n\n   Conclusion for letters: The letters are V and W, with V in the first position and W in the second position.\n\nCombining the conclusions for numbers and letters, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"7\", \"0\", \"V\", \"W\"] >>>"
