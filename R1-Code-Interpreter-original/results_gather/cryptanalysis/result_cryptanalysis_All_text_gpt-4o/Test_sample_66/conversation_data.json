    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, and 3, we know that 7, 2, 5, 4, 9 are incorrect numbers.\n   - From guess 11, both numbers 1 and 8 are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - From guesses 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, we know that 8 is a correct number but in the wrong position, confirming that 1 is the first number and 8 is the second number.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10, we know that F, Y, K, S, Q, B, U, E, I, R, L, and W are incorrect letters.\n   - From guess 6, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. Since U and E are incorrect, D is the correct letter in the first position.\n   - From guess 8, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. Since N is correct but in the wrong position, it must be the second letter.\n\n3. **Final Deduction:**\n   - The numbers are 1 and 8, as confirmed by guess 11.\n   - The letters are D and N, with D in the first position and N in the second position.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"1\", \"8\", \"D\", \"N\"] >>>"
