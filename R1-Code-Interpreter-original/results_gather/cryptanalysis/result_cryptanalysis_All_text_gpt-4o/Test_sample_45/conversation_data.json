    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 52OL**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 20FP**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 08EX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 58RN**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 64UM**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 02PV**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 62CO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n8. **Guess: 91CD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n9. **Guess: 96SR**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From guesses 1, 4, 7, and 8, we know that the numbers 5, 2, 0, 8, 6, 1, 9 are incorrect.\n- From guess 3, the number 0 is incorrect and too large, so the correct numbers must be smaller than 0.\n- From guess 5, the number 6 is incorrect and too large, so the correct numbers must be smaller than 6.\n- From guess 9, the number 9 is incorrect and too large, so the correct numbers must be smaller than 9.\n- The only possible numbers left are 3 and 4.\n\n- From guess 1, letters O and L are incorrect and too early.\n- From guess 2, letters F and P are incorrect and too early.\n- From guess 4, letters R and N are incorrect and too early.\n- From guess 5, letter U is correct and in the correct position, and M is incorrect and too early.\n- From guess 6, letters P and V are incorrect.\n- From guess 7, letters C and O are incorrect and too early.\n- From guess 8, letters C and D are incorrect and too early.\n- From guess 9, letter S is correct but in the wrong position, and R is incorrect and too early.\n\n- The only possible letters left are S and U.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The numbers are 3 and 4.\n- The letters are S and U.\n- From guess 5, U is in the correct position, so it must be the third character.\n- From guess 9, S is in the wrong position, so it must be the fourth character.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"3\", \"4\", \"U\", \"S\"] >>>"
