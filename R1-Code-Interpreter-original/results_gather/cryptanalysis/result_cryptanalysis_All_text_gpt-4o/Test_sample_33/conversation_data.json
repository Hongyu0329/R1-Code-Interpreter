    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 35WJ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Either 3 or 5 is correct and in the correct position. W and J are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 67VX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 6 and 7 are not in the password. V and X are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 37QK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 3 and 7 are not in the password. Either Q or K is correct and in the correct position.\n\n4. **Guess: 75GT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 5 is correct and in the correct position (since 7 is not in the password). G and T are not in the password.\n\n5. **Guess: 34QE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 3 and 4 are not in the password. Q and E are not in the password.\n\n6. **Guess: 27CU**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 2 and 7 are not in the password. C and U are not in the password.\n\n7. **Guess: 56FA**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: 5 is correct but in the wrong position (since 6 is not in the password). F and A are not in the password.\n\n8. **Guess: 84YT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 8 is correct and in the correct position. 4 is incorrect and too small. Y is correct and in the correct position. T is not in the password.\n\n**Final Analysis:**\n- From the above, the numbers 5 and 8 are correct. 5 is in the second position, and 8 is in the first position.\n- The letters Q, E, W, J, V, X, G, T, C, U, F, A are incorrect. The only remaining letters are K and Y.\n- From guess 3, K is in the correct position, which is the third position.\n- From guess 8, Y is in the correct position, which is the fourth position.\n\nThus, the password is:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"5\", \"K\", \"Y\"] >>>"
