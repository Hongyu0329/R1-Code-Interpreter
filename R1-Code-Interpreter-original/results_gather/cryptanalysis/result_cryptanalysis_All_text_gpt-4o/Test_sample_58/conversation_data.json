    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully:\n\n1. **Guess: 10PR**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 79EN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 70GE**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 94QE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 05LE**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n6. **Guess: 83CS**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 03ZF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Guess 1, numbers must be greater than 1 and 0.\n- From Guess 2, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is too large. So, 7 or 9 is correct, but not in the first position.\n- From Guess 3, one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is too small. So, 0 is too small, and 7 is correct but not in the first position.\n- From Guess 4, 9 and 4 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 5, 0 is too small, and 5 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From Guess 6, 8 and 3 are incorrect.\n- From Guess 7, 0 and 3 are too small, so the numbers must be greater than 3.\n\nFrom the above, the possible numbers are 5 and 7, with 5 in the first position and 7 in the second position.\n\n- From Guess 1, P and R are incorrect.\n- From Guess 2, E and N are incorrect.\n- From Guess 3, G and E are incorrect and too early.\n- From Guess 4, Q and E are incorrect.\n- From Guess 5, L and E are incorrect and too early.\n- From Guess 6, C and S are incorrect.\n- From Guess 7, Z is correct and in the correct position, F is incorrect and too early.\n\nFrom the above, the possible letters are Z and a letter after F. Since Z is in the correct position, the other letter must be after F and not in the list of incorrect letters. The only letter that fits is Y.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"5\", \"7\", \"Y\", \"Z\"] >>>"
