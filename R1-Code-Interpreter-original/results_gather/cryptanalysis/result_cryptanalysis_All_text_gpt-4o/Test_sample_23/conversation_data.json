    "To deduce the correct password, let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 98LZ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 9 or 8 is correct and in the correct position. The other number is too large, so it must be 9 since 8 is smaller. Both letters L and Z are incorrect and too late, so the correct letters must be earlier in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 82EM**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Since 8 was in the correct position in the first guess, it must be the correct number but in the wrong position here, meaning 2 is the correct number but in the wrong position. E is correct but in the wrong position, and M is incorrect and too late.\n\n3. **Guess: 36ZI**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 3 and 6 are not part of the password. Letters Z and I are incorrect and too late, confirming that the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 21HR**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Number 2 is correct but in the wrong position, confirming it should be in the second position. Number 1 is incorrect. Letter H is correct and in the correct position, and R is incorrect and too late.\n\n**Final Analysis:**\n- From the above deductions, the numbers are 8 and 2, with 8 in the first position and 2 in the second position.\n- The letters are E and H, with H in the third position and E in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"2\", \"H\", \"E\"] >>>"
