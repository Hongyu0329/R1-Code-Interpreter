    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 08VY**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Either '0' or '8' is correct and in the correct position. 'V' and 'Y' are incorrect and should be earlier in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 07CX**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Either '0' or '7' is correct and in the correct position. 'C' and 'X' are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 45NJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: '4' and '5' are too large, so the numbers must be less than 4. Either 'N' or 'J' is correct and in the correct position.\n\n4. **Guess: 28YQ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Either '2' or '8' is correct but in the wrong position. 'Y' and 'Q' are incorrect, and 'Q' is too late in the alphabet.\n\n**Combining the information:**\n\n- From conditions 1 and 2, '0' is the only number that appears in both guesses and is correct and in the correct position. Therefore, '0' is the first number.\n- From condition 3, numbers must be less than 4. Therefore, the possible numbers are '0', '1', '2', and '3'.\n- From condition 4, '2' is correct but in the wrong position, so '2' must be the second number.\n- From condition 3, either 'N' or 'J' is correct and in the correct position. Since 'N' is not in the correct position in condition 4, 'J' must be correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 4, one letter is correct but in the wrong position. Since 'J' is correct and in the correct position, 'N' must be the correct letter but in the wrong position.\n\n**Final deduction:**\n\n- Numbers: '0' and '2'\n- Letters: 'J' and 'N'\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"0\", \"2\", \"J\", \"N\"] >>>"
