    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (52FR): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. This means one of 5 or 2 is correct but misplaced, and the other is incorrect and too small.\n   - From Guess 2 (02IT): Both numbers are incorrect and too small. This means 0 and 2 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 3 (37AO): Both numbers are incorrect. This means 3 and 7 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 4 (17FJ): Both numbers are incorrect. This means 1 and 7 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 5 (79NP): Both numbers are incorrect and too large. This means 7 and 9 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 6 (91CK): Both numbers are incorrect. This means 9 and 1 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 7 (56SM): Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions. This means 5 and 6 are the correct numbers but need to be swapped.\n   - From Guess 8 (76BJ): One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. This confirms 6 is correct but misplaced, and 7 is incorrect.\n   - From Guess 9 (31RG): Both numbers are incorrect and too small. This confirms 3 and 1 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 10 (94AV): Both numbers are incorrect. This confirms 9 and 4 are not in the password.\n\n   From the above analysis, the correct numbers are 5 and 6, with 6 in the first position and 5 in the second position.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (52FR): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 2 (02IT): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 3 (37AO): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means the correct letters are after O.\n   - From Guess 4 (17FJ): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means the correct letters are after J.\n   - From Guess 5 (79NP): One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means P is correct but misplaced, and N is incorrect.\n   - From Guess 6 (91CK): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means the correct letters are after K.\n   - From Guess 7 (56SM): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 8 (76BJ): Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means the correct letters are after J.\n   - From Guess 9 (31RG): Both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 10 (94AV): One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This means V is correct and in the correct position, and A is incorrect.\n\n   From the above analysis, the correct letters are P and V, with V in the fourth position and P in the third position.\n\nCombining the correct numbers and letters, the password is:\n\n<<< [\"6\", \"5\", \"P\", \"V\"] >>>"
