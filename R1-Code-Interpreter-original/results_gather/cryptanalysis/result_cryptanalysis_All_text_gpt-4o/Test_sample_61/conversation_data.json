    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 07UC**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Either 0 or 7 is correct but in the wrong position. U and C are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 60FG**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 6 is correct and in the correct position (first position). 0 is incorrect and too large, so the other number must be less than 0. F and G are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 59VF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Both 5 and 9 are too large, so the numbers must be less than 5. V is correct and in the correct position (third position). F is incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 85EK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Both 8 and 5 are too large, so the numbers must be less than 5. E is correct but in the wrong position. K is incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 18MA**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 1 is correct and in the correct position (first position). 8 is incorrect and too large, so the other number must be less than 8. M and A are not in the password.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n- The first number is 1 (from guess 5).\n- The second number must be less than 5 and 0 (from guesses 2 and 3), so it must be 3 or 4.\n- The third position letter is V (from guess 3).\n- The fourth position letter is E (from guess 4, since E is correct but in the wrong position in guess 4).\n\nNow, let's determine the second number:\n- From guess 1, 0 or 7 is correct but in the wrong position. Since 0 is too large (from guess 2), it must be 3 or 4.\n- From guess 5, 8 is too large, so the second number must be 3 or 4.\n- Since 6 is correct in the first position (from guess 2), the second number must be 3 (as 4 is not possible due to the feedback from guess 1).\n\nThus, the password is:\n<<< [\"1\", \"3\", \"V\", \"E\"] >>>"
