    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 98SO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers must be less than 9 and 8. One of S or O is correct and in the correct position.\n\n2. **Guess: 34ZW**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: One of 3 or 4 is correct but in the wrong position. Numbers must be greater than 3. Letters must be earlier in the alphabet than Z and W.\n\n3. **Guess: 91HL**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers 9 and 1 are incorrect. One of H or L is correct and in the correct position. The incorrect letter is too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 47OB**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Either 4 or 7 is correct and in the correct position. The incorrect number is too large, so it must be 7. Letters O and B are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 65NA**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Either 6 or 5 is correct and in the correct position. The incorrect number is too large, so it must be 6. Letters N and A are incorrect.\n\n**Deducing the numbers:**\n- From conditions 4 and 5, we know that one of 4 or 5 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 2, one of 3 or 4 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From condition 4, 7 is incorrect and too large, so 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 5, 6 is incorrect and too large, so 5 is correct and in the correct position.\n- Therefore, the numbers are 4 and 5.\n\n**Deducing the letters:**\n- From condition 1, one of S or O is correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 3, one of H or L is correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 2, letters must be earlier in the alphabet than Z and W.\n- From condition 4, O and B are incorrect.\n- From condition 5, N and A are incorrect.\n- From condition 3, L is too early in the alphabet, so H is correct and in the correct position.\n- From condition 1, S is correct and in the correct position.\n\n**Final password:**\n- Numbers: 4 and 5\n- Letters: S and H\n\nThe correct password is <<< [\"4\", \"5\", \"S\", \"H\"] >>>."
