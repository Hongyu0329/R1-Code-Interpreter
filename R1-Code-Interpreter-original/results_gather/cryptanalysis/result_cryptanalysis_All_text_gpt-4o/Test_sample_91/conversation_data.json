    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 47LE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers are less than 4 and 7. Letters are not L or E.\n\n2. **Guess: 10FX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 1 or 0 is correct but misplaced. Letters are not F or X.\n\n3. **Guess: 50ZK**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Number 5 is incorrect and too large. Number 0 is correct but misplaced. Letters are not Z or K.\n\n4. **Guess: 48IM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers are less than 4 and 8. Letters are I and M but need to be swapped.\n\n5. **Guess: 86NM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: Numbers are less than 8 and 6. Letter M is correct but needs to be swapped. Letter N is incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 39KL**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Number 3 is correct but misplaced. Number 9 is incorrect and too large. Letters are not K or L.\n\n**Deducing the numbers:**\n- From conditions 1, 4, and 5, numbers must be less than 4, 8, 7, and 6. Possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3.\n- From condition 2, one of 1 or 0 is correct but misplaced.\n- From condition 3, 0 is correct but misplaced.\n- From condition 6, 3 is correct but misplaced.\n\n**Deducing the letters:**\n- From condition 4, letters I and M are correct but need to be swapped.\n- From condition 5, M is correct but needs to be swapped.\n\n**Final deduction:**\n- Numbers: 0 and 3 are correct. Since 0 is misplaced in conditions 2 and 3, it should be in the second position. 3 is misplaced in condition 6, so it should be in the first position.\n- Letters: I and M are correct. From condition 4, they need to be swapped, so I should be in the second position and M in the first.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"3\", \"0\", \"M\", \"I\"] >>>"
