    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and its feedback carefully:\n\n1. **Guess: 48TY**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can infer:\n   - Either 4 or 8 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect number is too large, so it must be 8 (since 4 is smaller than 8).\n   - Either T or Y is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is too late in the alphabet, so it must be Y (since T comes before Y).\n\n2. **Guess: 61LS**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we can infer:\n   - Numbers 6 and 1 are not part of the password.\n   - Letters L and S are not part of the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 21KP**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can infer:\n   - Number 2 is correct and in the correct position (since 1 is incorrect and too small).\n   - Letter K is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - Letter P is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Combining the information:**\n\n- From the first guess, we know that 4 is correct but in the wrong position, and T is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From the second guess, we know that 6, 1, L, and S are not part of the password.\n- From the third guess, we know that 2 is correct and in the correct position, and K is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The numbers are 2 and 4. Since 2 is in the correct position in the third guess, the first number is 2, and the second number is 4.\n- The letters are T and K. Since T is in the wrong position in the first guess, and K is in the wrong position in the third guess, T must be the second letter, and K must be the first letter.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"4\", \"K\", \"T\"] >>>"
