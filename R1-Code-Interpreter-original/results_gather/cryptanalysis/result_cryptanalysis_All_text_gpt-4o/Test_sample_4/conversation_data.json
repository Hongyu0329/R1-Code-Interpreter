    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 41CK**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can infer:\n   - Either 4 or 1 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The incorrect number is too small, so it must be 1.\n   - One of the letters C or K is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is too early in the alphabet, so it must be C.\n\n2. **Guess: 64DE**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can infer:\n   - Either 6 or 4 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect number is 4.\n   - Both letters D and E are incorrect and too early, so the correct letters are later in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 87JY**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we can infer:\n   - Numbers 8 and 7 are not part of the password.\n   - Letters J and Y are not part of the password.\n\n4. **Guess: 12OD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can infer:\n   - Numbers 1 and 2 are not part of the password.\n   - One of the letters O or D is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is too early, so it must be D.\n\n**Deductions:**\n- From the numbers, we know:\n  - 4 is correct and in the correct position from Guess 1.\n  - 6 is correct but in the wrong position from Guess 2.\n  - Numbers 1, 2, 8, and 7 are not part of the password.\n\n- From the letters, we know:\n  - K is correct but in the wrong position from Guess 1.\n  - O is correct but in the wrong position from Guess 4.\n  - Letters C, D, E, J, and Y are not part of the password.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The correct numbers are 4 and 6. Since 4 is in the correct position in Guess 1, it must be the first number. Therefore, 6 is the second number.\n- The correct letters are K and O. Since K is in the wrong position in Guess 1, it must be the second letter. Therefore, O is the first letter.\n\nThus, the password is: <<< [\"4\", \"6\", \"O\", \"K\"] >>>"
