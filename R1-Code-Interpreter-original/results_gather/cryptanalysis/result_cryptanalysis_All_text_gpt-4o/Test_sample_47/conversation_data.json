    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 87VG**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: Either 8 or 7 is correct but in the wrong position. V and G are not in the password.\n\n2. **Guess: 53KJ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 5 and 3 are not in the password. K and J are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 68JZ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 6 and 8 are not in the password. J is incorrect. Z is correct and in the correct position.\n\n4. **Guess: 46JT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 4 and 6 are not in the password. J and T are not in the password.\n\n5. **Guess: 39HZ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - Conclusion: 3 and 9 are not in the password. H and Z are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n6. **Guess: 83UC**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: 8 and 3 are not in the password. U and C are not in the password.\n\n7. **Guess: 42CB**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: 2 is correct and in the correct position. 4 is incorrect. C and B are incorrect.\n\n**Summary of deductions:**\n- Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 7 are possible candidates.\n- Letters: H and Z are correct and in the correct positions.\n\n**Final deduction:**\n- From Guess 7, 2 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 1, 7 is correct but in the wrong position, so it must be the first number.\n- From Guess 5, H and Z are correct and in the correct positions.\n\nTherefore, the password is:\n\n<<< [\"7\", \"2\", \"H\", \"Z\"] >>>"
