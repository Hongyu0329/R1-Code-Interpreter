    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Condition 1 (80YC):** Both numbers and both letters are incorrect. This eliminates 8, 0, Y, and C.\n\n2. **Condition 2 (58LT):** \n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 8 is eliminated, 5 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - Both letters are incorrect, eliminating L and T.\n\n3. **Condition 3 (13QW):** Both numbers and both letters are incorrect. This eliminates 1, 3, Q, and W.\n\n4. **Condition 4 (36IL):** Both numbers and both letters are incorrect. This eliminates 6, I, and L (L was already eliminated).\n\n5. **Condition 5 (57CF):** \n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 5 is already known to be correct but in the wrong position, 7 is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since C is eliminated, F is correct and in the correct position.\n\n6. **Condition 6 (46KW):** Both numbers and both letters are incorrect. This confirms 4 and 6 are incorrect, and K and W are already eliminated.\n\n7. **Condition 7 (50GD):** \n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 5 is correct but in the wrong position, 0 is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect, eliminating G and D.\n\n8. **Condition 8 (05LX):** \n   - One number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is incorrect, 5 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - Both letters are incorrect, eliminating L and X.\n\n9. **Condition 9 (96SG):** Both numbers are incorrect and too large, and both letters are incorrect. This confirms 9 and 6 are incorrect, and S and G are already eliminated.\n\n10. **Condition 10 (45XI):** \n    - One number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect. Since 4 is incorrect, 5 is correct and in the correct position.\n    - Both letters are incorrect, confirming X and I are incorrect.\n\n11. **Condition 11 (64DF):** \n    - Both numbers are incorrect, confirming 6 and 4 are incorrect.\n    - One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since D is eliminated, F is correct and in the correct position.\n\n12. **Condition 12 (31SE):** Both numbers and both letters are incorrect. This confirms 3, 1, S, and E are incorrect.\n\n13. **Condition 13 (03LZ):** \n    - Both numbers are incorrect, confirming 0 and 3 are incorrect.\n    - One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect. Since L is eliminated, Z is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- The correct numbers are 5 and another number that is not 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. The only remaining number is 2.\n- The correct letters are F (in the correct position) and Z (in the wrong position).\n\nThus, the password is:\n<<< [\"5\", \"2\", \"Z\", \"F\"] >>>"
