    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, and 3, we know that one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. The numbers 7, 2, and 6 are too small, so the correct number must be 9.\n   - From guess 8, 9 is in the correct position, so the first number is 9.\n   - From guess 8, the second number is incorrect and too small, so it must be greater than 6. The only remaining number greater than 6 is 8.\n   - From guess 11, 8 is correct but in the wrong position, confirming that the second number is 8.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1, 2, and 3, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. This eliminates B, Q, and E.\n   - From guess 4, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early. This means T is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 5, both letters are incorrect and too early, eliminating N and P.\n   - From guess 6, both letters are incorrect and too early, eliminating F and Q.\n   - From guess 7, both letters are incorrect and too early, eliminating P and F again.\n   - From guess 8, both letters are incorrect and too early, eliminating M and J.\n   - From guess 9, both letters are incorrect, eliminating Y and J.\n   - From guess 10, both letters are incorrect, eliminating S and U.\n   - From guess 11, both letters are incorrect, eliminating X and J.\n   - From guess 12, both letters are incorrect, eliminating X and J again.\n   - From guess 13, both letters are incorrect, eliminating Z and U.\n   - From guess 14, both letters are incorrect, eliminating F and V.\n\n   The only letters left are T and W. Since T is correct but in the wrong position in guess 4, it must be the second letter. Therefore, the first letter is W.\n\nCombining the analysis, the password is:\n\n<<< [\"9\", \"8\", \"W\", \"T\"] >>>"
