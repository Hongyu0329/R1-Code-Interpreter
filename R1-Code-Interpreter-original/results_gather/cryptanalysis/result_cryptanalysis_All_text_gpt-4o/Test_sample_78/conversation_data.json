    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1: Guess 14HF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: This means neither 1 nor 4 is in the password.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: Either H or F is correct but not in the right position.\n   - One letter is incorrect: Either H or F is not in the password.\n\n2. **Condition 2: Guess 38FX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: Either 3 or 8 is correct but not in the right position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large: Either 3 or 8 is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Neither F nor X is in the password.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Guess 52YF**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: Either 5 or 2 is correct but not in the right position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large: Either 5 or 2 is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Neither Y nor F is in the password.\n\n4. **Condition 4: Guess 32QI**\n   - Both numbers are correct but in the wrong positions: 3 and 2 are the correct numbers but need to be swapped.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: Neither Q nor I is in the password, and the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Condition 5: Guess 71DX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Neither 7 nor 1 is in the password.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: Either D or X is correct and in the right position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet: Either D or X is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Condition 4, we know the numbers are 3 and 2, but they need to be swapped. So, the correct order is 23.\n- From Condition 5, since both numbers 7 and 1 are incorrect, it confirms that 3 and 2 are indeed the correct numbers.\n- From Condition 1, since F is incorrect, H must be the correct letter but in the wrong position.\n- From Condition 5, since X is incorrect and too late in the alphabet, D must be the correct letter and in the correct position.\n- From Condition 4, since Q and I are too late in the alphabet, and from Condition 5, X is too late, the correct letters must be earlier than these.\n- Therefore, the letters are H and D, with D in the correct position from Condition 5.\n\n**Final Deduction:**\n\n- The numbers are 2 and 3.\n- The letters are H and D, with D in the correct position.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"3\", \"H\", \"D\"] >>>"
