    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (16QS), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 2 (23YQ), one number is correct but in the wrong position. This means either 2 or 3 is correct.\n   - From Guess 3 (92FQ), both numbers are incorrect. This eliminates 2 and 9.\n   - From Guess 4 (13MS), one number is correct but in the wrong position. This means 3 is correct but not in the first position.\n   - From Guess 5 (51BU), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 6 (62RQ), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 7 (37HS), one number is correct and in the correct position. This confirms 3 is correct and in the first position.\n   - From Guess 8 (58IJ), both numbers are incorrect and too large. This eliminates 5 and 8.\n   - From Guess 9 (46WB), both numbers are incorrect and too large. This eliminates 4 and 6.\n   - From Guess 10 (46BP), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From Guess 11 (43PR), one number is correct but in the wrong position. This confirms 3 is correct and in the first position, and 4 is incorrect.\n   - From Guess 12 (60CA), one number is correct and in the correct position. This confirms 0 is correct and in the second position.\n   - From Guess 13 (90QC), one number is correct and in the correct position. This confirms 0 is correct and in the second position.\n   - From Guess 14 (94OG), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n\n   **Conclusion for Numbers:** The numbers are 3 and 0, with 3 in the first position and 0 in the second position.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (16QS), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 2 (23YQ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 3 (92FQ), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 4 (13MS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 5 (51BU), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 6 (62RQ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 7 (37HS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 8 (58IJ), one letter is correct but in the wrong position. This means either I or J is correct.\n   - From Guess 9 (46WB), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 10 (46BP), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 11 (43PR), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 12 (60CA), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From Guess 13 (90QC), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From Guess 14 (94OG), both letters are incorrect.\n\n   **Conclusion for Letters:** From Guess 8, I is correct but in the wrong position, and J is incorrect. Since all other letters are either too late or too early, the letters must be I and H, with I in the second position and H in the first position.\n\n**Final Answer:** The correct password is <<< [\"3\", \"0\", \"H\", \"I\"] >>>."
