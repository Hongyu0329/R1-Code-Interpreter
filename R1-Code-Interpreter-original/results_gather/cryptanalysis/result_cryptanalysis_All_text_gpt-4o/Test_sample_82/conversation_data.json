    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **From Guess 87CF:**\n   - Both numbers (8, 7) are incorrect and too large. Therefore, the numbers must be less than 7.\n   - Both letters (C, F) are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Therefore, the letters must be later than F.\n\n2. **From Guess 71SM:**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. Since 7 is too large (from condition 1), 1 must be the correct number but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late. Since M is later than F, M is incorrect, and S must be the correct letter but in the wrong position.\n\n3. **From Guess 23AY:**\n   - Both numbers (2, 3) are incorrect. Therefore, the numbers must be 0, 1, 4, 5, or 6.\n   - Both letters (A, Y) are incorrect. Therefore, the letters must be G, H, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, or X.\n\n4. **From Guess 53PD:**\n   - Both numbers (5, 3) are incorrect. Therefore, the numbers must be 0, 1, 4, or 6.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early. Since D is too early, P must be the correct letter but in the wrong position.\n\n5. **From Guess 01UF:**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is too small, 1 must be the correct number but in the wrong position.\n   - Both letters (U, F) are incorrect. Therefore, the letters must be G, H, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, or X.\n\n6. **From Guess 43US:**\n   - Both numbers (4, 3) are incorrect. Therefore, the numbers must be 0 or 6.\n   - Both letters (U, S) are incorrect and too late. Therefore, the letters must be G, H, I, J, K, L, N, O, P, Q, R, or T.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The numbers must be 0 and 6, with 1 being the correct number but in the wrong position in previous guesses.\n- The letters must be P and another letter earlier than S but later than F, which is T.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe correct password is <<< [\"6\", \"0\", \"P\", \"T\"] >>>."
