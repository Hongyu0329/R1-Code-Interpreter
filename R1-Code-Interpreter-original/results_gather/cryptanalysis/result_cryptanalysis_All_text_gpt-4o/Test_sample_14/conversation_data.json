    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 25YN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - One of the numbers 2 or 5 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other number (either 2 or 5) is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters Y and N are incorrect and come after the correct letters in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 42CQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Numbers 4 and 2 are both too small.\n   - Letters C and Q are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 76KC**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Either 7 or 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number (either 7 or 6) is incorrect and too large.\n   - One of the letters K or C is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other letter (either K or C) is incorrect and comes before the correct letter in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 26SG**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we know:\n   - Either 2 or 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number (either 2 or 6) is incorrect and too small.\n   - One of the letters S or G is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other letter (either S or G) is incorrect and comes after the correct letter in the alphabet.\n\n**Step-by-step deduction:**\n\n- From guess 2, numbers 4 and 2 are too small, so the correct numbers must be greater than 4.\n- From guess 3, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is too large. Since 7 is the only number greater than 4, it must be correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one is too small. Since 6 is the only number greater than 4 and less than 7, it must be correct and in the correct position.\n- Therefore, the numbers are 7 and 6.\n\n- From guess 1, both letters Y and N are too late in the alphabet, so the correct letters must be earlier.\n- From guess 3, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is too early. Since K is the only letter that fits this description, it must be correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is too late. Since G is the only letter that fits this description, it must be correct and in the correct position.\n- Therefore, the letters are K and G.\n\nCombining these deductions, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"7\", \"6\", \"K\", \"G\"] >>>"
