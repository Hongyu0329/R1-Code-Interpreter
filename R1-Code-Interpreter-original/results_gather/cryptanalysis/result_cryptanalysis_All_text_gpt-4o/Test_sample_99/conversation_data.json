    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 87VX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 8 and 7 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: V and X are not in the password and the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 26AP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 2 and 6 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: A and P are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 98ZT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: Either 9 or 8 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect: The incorrect number is not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: Z and T are not in the password and the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 98HL**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: From previous, 9 is correct and in the first position.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: H is correct and in the third position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet: L is not in the password.\n\n5. **Guess: 93BN**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: 9 is correct and in the first position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small: 3 is incorrect and too small, so the second number is greater than 3.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: B and N are not in the password.\n\n6. **Guess: 37CG**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 3 and 7 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet: C and G are not in the password and the correct letters are later in the alphabet.\n\n7. **Guess: 17KW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 1 and 7 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: K and W are not in the password and the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n8. **Guess: 92XC**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: 9 is correct and in the first position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small: 2 is incorrect and too small, so the second number is greater than 2.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: X and C are not in the password.\n\n9. **Guess: 30NX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small: 3 and 0 are not in the password and the correct numbers are greater.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: N and X are not in the password and the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n10. **Guess: 74DJ**\n    - One number is correct and in the correct position: From previous, 9 is correct and in the first position.\n    - Both letters are incorrect: D and J are not in the password.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- The first number is 9.\n- The second number must be greater than 3, 2, and 0, and not 7, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, or 0. The only possibility is 5.\n- The correct letter in the third position is H.\n- The second letter must be between C and G, and earlier than D, J, K, L, N, P, T, V, W, X, Z. The only possibility is F.\n\nThus, the password is:\n\n<<< [\"9\", \"5\", \"H\", \"F\"] >>>"
