    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Condition 1: 13GO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 1 and 3 are not in the password.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: Either G or O is correct.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet: The incorrect letter is before the correct letter alphabetically.\n\n2. **Condition 2: 26LC**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: Either 2 or 6 is correct.\n   - One number is incorrect: The incorrect number is either 2 or 6.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: L and C are not in the password.\n\n3. **Condition 3: 95SX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 9 and 5 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: S and X are not in the password, and the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Condition 4: 94UG**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 9 and 4 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: U and G are not in the password.\n\n5. **Condition 5: 12AT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 1 and 2 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: A and T are not in the password.\n\n6. **Condition 6: 61KJ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: 6 is correct and in the first position.\n   - One number is incorrect: 1 is not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: K and J are not in the password.\n\n7. **Condition 7: 56GL**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: 5 is correct and should be in the first position.\n   - One number is incorrect: 6 is not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: G and L are not in the password.\n\n8. **Condition 8: 37BM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 3 and 7 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: B and M are not in the password.\n\n9. **Condition 9: 24IW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 2 and 4 are not in the password.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: Either I or W is correct.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet: The incorrect letter is after the correct letter alphabetically.\n\n**Deductions:**\n- From conditions 6 and 7, we know 6 is correct and in the first position, and 5 is correct but should be in the second position.\n- From conditions 1, 4, and 7, G is incorrect.\n- From conditions 1 and 9, O is correct and in the correct position.\n- From conditions 3 and 9, I is correct and in the correct position.\n\n**Final Password:**\n- Numbers: 6 and 5\n- Letters: I and O\n\nTherefore, the correct password is <<< [\"6\", \"5\", \"I\", \"O\"] >>>."
