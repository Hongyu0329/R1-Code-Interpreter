    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 47YQ**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect and too large; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers must be less than 4 and 7. The letters must be earlier in the alphabet than Y and Q.\n\n2. **Guess: 91LQ**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: The numbers 9 and 1 are incorrect. One of the letters L or Q is correct and in the correct position. Since Q is too late in the alphabet (from the first guess), L must be the correct letter in the correct position.\n\n3. **Guess: 23TP**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and incorrect; both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 2 or 3 is correct but in the wrong position. The letters T and P are too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 09KG**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect and too large; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Conclusion: One of the numbers 0 or 9 is correct but in the wrong position. Since 9 is too large (from the second guess), 0 must be the correct number but in the wrong position. One of the letters K or G is correct and in the correct position. Since L is already correct from the second guess, K must be incorrect, making G the correct letter in the correct position.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- The correct numbers are 0 and one of 2 or 3. Since 0 is in the wrong position in the fourth guess, it must be the second number.\n- The correct letters are L and G, with L in the second position and G in the fourth position.\n\nNow, we need to determine the correct number between 2 and 3:\n- From the third guess, one of 2 or 3 is correct but in the wrong position. Since 0 is the second number, the correct number must be 3, and it should be in the first position.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n<<< [\"3\", \"0\", \"L\", \"G\"] >>>"
