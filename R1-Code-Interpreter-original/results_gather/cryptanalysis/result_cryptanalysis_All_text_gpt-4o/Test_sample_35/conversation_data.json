    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition carefully and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Condition 1: Guess 14LZ**\n   - Both numbers (1 and 4) are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters (L and Z) are incorrect.\n\n2. **Condition 2: Guess 28EP**\n   - Both numbers (2 and 8) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (E or P) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Guess 14RW**\n   - Both numbers (1 and 4) are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters (R and W) are incorrect.\n\n4. **Condition 4: Guess 70XH**\n   - Both numbers (7 and 0) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (X or H) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Conditions 1 and 3, we know the numbers are 1 and 4, but they need to be swapped. So, the correct order for the numbers is 4 and 1.\n\n- From Condition 2, since both numbers are incorrect, we confirm that 2 and 8 are not part of the password. Also, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since E and P are the letters, and one is correct, we need to determine which one.\n\n- From Condition 4, since both numbers are incorrect, we confirm that 7 and 0 are not part of the password. Also, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since X and H are the letters, and one is correct, we need to determine which one.\n\n- From Conditions 2 and 4, we know:\n  - One letter from E and P is correct and in the correct position.\n  - One letter from X and H is correct and in the correct position.\n  - The incorrect letters are too early in the alphabet, meaning they are before the correct letters alphabetically.\n\n- Since L, Z, R, and W are incorrect (from Conditions 1 and 3), and considering the feedback about letters being too early, we deduce:\n  - E is incorrect because it is too early compared to P.\n  - X is correct because it is later in the alphabet than H.\n\n- Therefore, the correct letters are P and X, with P in the second position (from Condition 2) and X in the third position (from Condition 4).\n\n**Final Password:**\n- Numbers: 4 and 1 (in this order).\n- Letters: P and X (in this order).\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"1\", \"P\", \"X\"] >>>"
