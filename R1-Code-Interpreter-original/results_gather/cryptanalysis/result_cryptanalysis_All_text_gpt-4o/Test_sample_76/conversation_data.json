    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 05XU** - Both numbers and both letters are incorrect. This eliminates 0, 5, X, and U.\n\n2. **Guess: 80UC** - One number is correct but in the wrong position, one number is incorrect and too small, both letters are incorrect. This means 8 or 0 is correct but in the wrong position, and 0 is too small. Since 0 is already eliminated, 8 is correct but in the wrong position. U and C are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 61HP** - One number is correct but in the wrong position, one number is incorrect, both letters are incorrect. This means 6 or 1 is correct but in the wrong position. Since 1 is incorrect, 6 is correct but in the wrong position. H and P are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 38JO** - One number is correct and in the correct position, one number is incorrect, both letters are incorrect. Since 8 is correct but in the wrong position from guess 2, 3 is correct and in the correct position. J and O are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 41TO** - One number is correct but in the wrong position, one number is incorrect, both letters are incorrect. Since 1 is incorrect, 4 is correct but in the wrong position. T and O are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 39PF** - Both numbers are incorrect, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, one letter is incorrect. Since 3 is correct from guess 4, 9 is incorrect. P is incorrect, F is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n7. **Guess: 51KR** - One number is correct but in the wrong position, one number is incorrect, both letters are incorrect. Since 1 is incorrect, 5 is correct but in the wrong position. K and R are incorrect.\n\n8. **Guess: 13BE** - One number is correct and in the correct position, one number is incorrect, both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since 3 is correct from guess 4, 1 is incorrect. B and E are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n9. **Guess: 83AZ** - One number is correct but in the wrong position, one number is incorrect, both letters are incorrect. Since 3 is correct from guess 4, 8 is correct but in the wrong position. A and Z are incorrect.\n\n10. **Guess: 54LV** - Both numbers are incorrect, one letter is correct and in the correct position, one letter is incorrect. Since 5 and 4 are incorrect, L is correct and in the correct position, V is incorrect.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- Numbers: 3 is in the first position, 8 is in the second position.\n- Letters: L is in the third position, F is in the fourth position.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"3\", \"8\", \"L\", \"F\"] >>>"
