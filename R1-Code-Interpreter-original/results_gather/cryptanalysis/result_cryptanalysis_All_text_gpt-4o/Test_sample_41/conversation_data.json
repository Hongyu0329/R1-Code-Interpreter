    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1: Guess 25SN**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - This means the numbers 2 and 5 are not in the password, and the letters S and N are not in the password. Also, the letters in the password are earlier in the alphabet than S and N.\n\n2. **Condition 2: Guess 28CK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - This means the numbers 2 and 8 are not in the password, and the letters C and K are not in the password.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Guess 93CH**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - This means either 9 or 3 is correct and in the correct position. Since 3 is too large, 9 must be correct and in the first position. The letters C and H are not in the password.\n\n4. **Condition 4: Guess 24RD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - This means the numbers 2 and 4 are not in the password. One of the letters R or D is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is too late in the alphabet. Since D is too late, R must be correct but in the wrong position.\n\n5. **Condition 5: Guess 07DM**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - This means 0 is correct but in the wrong position, and 7 is incorrect. The letters D and M are correct and in the correct positions.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- The correct numbers are 9 and 0. Since 9 is in the first position (from Condition 3) and 0 is in the second position (from Condition 5), the numbers are 9 and 0.\n- The correct letters are D and M, with D in the third position and M in the fourth position (from Condition 5).\n\nThus, the password is 90DM.\n\nThe final answer is: <<< [\"9\", \"0\", \"D\", \"M\"] >>>"
