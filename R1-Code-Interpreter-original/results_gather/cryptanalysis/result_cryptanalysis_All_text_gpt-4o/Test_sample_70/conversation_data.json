    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition and eliminate possibilities step by step.\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (80ZV), both numbers are incorrect. So, 8 and 0 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 2 (91PE), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too large. So, either 9 or 1 is correct, and the incorrect number is larger than the correct one.\n   - From Guess 3 (51DH), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and incorrect. So, either 5 or 1 is correct.\n   - From Guess 4 (19HC), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large. So, 1 is correct but in the wrong position, and 9 is incorrect.\n   - From Guess 7 (21GK), one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and incorrect. So, either 2 or 1 is correct.\n   - From Guess 11 (92SC), both numbers are incorrect. So, 9 and 2 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 12 (03XO), both numbers are incorrect. So, 0 and 3 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 13 (23JH), both numbers are incorrect. So, 2 and 3 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 14 (05TQ), both numbers are incorrect. So, 0 and 5 are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 15 (60QF), both numbers are incorrect. So, 6 and 0 are not in the password.\n\n   From the above analysis, the only possible numbers are 1 and 4. Since 1 is correct but in the wrong position in Guess 4, it must be the second number. Therefore, the numbers are 4 and 1.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From Guess 1 (80ZV), both letters are incorrect. So, Z and V are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 2 (91PE), both letters are incorrect. So, P and E are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 3 (51DH), both letters are incorrect. So, D and H are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 4 (19HC), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. So, C is correct and in the correct position, and H is incorrect.\n   - From Guess 5 (38CA), one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since C is correct in the previous guess, A is incorrect and too early.\n   - From Guess 6 (25FG), both letters are incorrect. So, F and G are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 7 (21GK), both letters are incorrect. So, G and K are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 8 (48FL), both letters are incorrect. So, F and L are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 9 (80DL), both letters are incorrect. So, D and L are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 10 (43ZO), both letters are incorrect. So, Z and O are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 11 (92SC), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. Since C is correct in the previous guess, S is incorrect.\n   - From Guess 12 (03XO), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and incorrect. Since O is incorrect, X is correct.\n   - From Guess 13 (23JH), both letters are incorrect. So, J and H are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 14 (05TQ), both letters are incorrect. So, T and Q are not in the password.\n   - From Guess 15 (60QF), both letters are incorrect. So, Q and F are not in the password.\n\n   From the above analysis, the letters are C and X. Since C is in the correct position in Guess 4, it must be the third letter. Therefore, the letters are X and C.\n\nCombining the numbers and letters, the password is:\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"1\", \"X\", \"C\"] >>>"
