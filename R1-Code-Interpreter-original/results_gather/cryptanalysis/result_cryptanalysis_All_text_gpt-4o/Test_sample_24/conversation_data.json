    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 95WC**\n   - Feedback: \n     - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - One number is incorrect.\n     - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n     - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - Analysis:\n     - Since one number is correct but in the wrong position, either 9 or 5 is correct but misplaced.\n     - One number is incorrect, so either 9 or 5 is not in the password.\n     - One letter is correct and in the correct position, so either W or C is correct and in the right spot.\n     - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so either W or C is incorrect and comes before the correct letter alphabetically.\n\n2. **Guess: 12XN**\n   - Feedback:\n     - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n     - One number is incorrect.\n     - Both letters are incorrect.\n   - Analysis:\n     - Since one number is correct and in the correct position, either 1 or 2 is correct and in the right spot.\n     - One number is incorrect, so either 1 or 2 is not in the password.\n     - Both letters are incorrect, so neither X nor N is in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 92LS**\n   - Feedback:\n     - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - One number is incorrect.\n     - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - One letter is incorrect.\n   - Analysis:\n     - Since one number is correct but in the wrong position, either 9 or 2 is correct but misplaced.\n     - One number is incorrect, so either 9 or 2 is not in the password.\n     - One letter is correct but in the wrong position, so either L or S is correct but misplaced.\n     - One letter is incorrect, so either L or S is not in the password.\n\n**Combining the Analysis:**\n\n- From Guess 1 and 3, 9 is a candidate for the correct number but in the wrong position.\n- From Guess 2, 1 is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 1, W is correct and in the correct position.\n- From Guess 3, L is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The correct numbers are 1 and 9. Since 1 is in the correct position in Guess 2, it must be the first number.\n- The correct letters are W and L. Since W is in the correct position in Guess 1, it must be the third character.\n- L is correct but in the wrong position in Guess 3, so it must be the fourth character.\n\nThus, the password is: <<< [\"1\", \"9\", \"W\", \"L\"] >>>"
