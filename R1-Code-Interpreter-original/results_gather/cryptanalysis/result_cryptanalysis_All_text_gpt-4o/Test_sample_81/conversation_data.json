    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1 (97YS), both numbers are too large.\n   - From guess 5 (02SV), both numbers are too small.\n   - From guess 6 (96CL), one number is correct and one is too large.\n   - From guess 9 (01GF), both numbers are too small.\n   - From guess 11 (09XR), both numbers are incorrect.\n\n   From these, we can deduce that the numbers must be between 3 and 8. Since guess 6 (96CL) has one correct number, and 9 is too large, the correct number must be 6. The other number must be between 3 and 8, excluding 6, so it could be 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1 (97YS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2 (70GF), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 3 (17YC), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (72XP), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (02SV), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6 (96CL), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7 (54EW), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (02XS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9 (01GF), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 10 (40GU), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11 (09XR), one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From guess 11, R is too late in the alphabet, so X is correct. The other letter must be later than F, G, C, L, E, W, S, V, and earlier than R. The only letter that fits is Q.\n\n3. **Final Deduction:**\n   - Numbers: We know 6 is one of the numbers. The other number must be 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8. Since 6 is in the correct position in guess 6 (96CL), the first number must be 6. The second number must be 8, as it is the only number left that fits the criteria.\n   - Letters: From the analysis, the letters are X and Q.\n\nThus, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"6\", \"8\", \"X\", \"Q\"] >>>"
