    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 86WU**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 94MF**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 80UV**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 47TH**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 03SU**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Numbers:**\n  - From Guess 1 (86WU) and Guess 3 (80UV), we know 8 and 6 are incorrect.\n  - From Guess 2 (94MF), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. Since 8, 6, and 0 are incorrect, 9 must be correct but in the wrong position.\n  - From Guess 4 (47TH), both numbers are incorrect, so 4 and 7 are not part of the password.\n  - From Guess 5 (03SU), one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is incorrect, 3 must be correct but in the wrong position.\n  - Therefore, the numbers are 9 and 3, with 9 in the second position and 3 in the first position.\n\n- **Letters:**\n  - From Guess 1 (86WU), one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect. Since U is incorrect (from Guess 3), W must be correct but in the wrong position.\n  - From Guess 2 (94MF), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, so M and F are not part of the password.\n  - From Guess 3 (80UV), both letters are incorrect, so U and V are not part of the password.\n  - From Guess 4 (47TH), one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too early in the alphabet. Since T is too early, H must be correct and in the correct position.\n  - From Guess 5 (03SU), both letters are incorrect, so S and U are not part of the password.\n  - Therefore, the letters are W and H, with W in the first position and H in the second position.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe correct password is <<< [\"3\", \"9\", \"W\", \"H\"] >>>."
