    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guesses 1 and 3, we know that the numbers 9 and 5 are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - From guess 2, numbers 7 and 0 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4, numbers 0 and 8 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5, numbers 1 and 6 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6, numbers 1 and 8 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7, number 9 is correct and in the correct position, number 1 is incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 8, numbers 6 and 3 are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9, numbers 4 and 3 are incorrect and too small.\n   - From guess 10, numbers 4 and 1 are incorrect and too small.\n\n   Conclusion: The numbers must be 9 and 5, with 9 in the first position and 5 in the second position.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1, letters O and K are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 2, letters E and Z are incorrect.\n   - From guess 3, letters R and N are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 4, letters E and F are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 5, letter O is incorrect and too early, Y is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 6, letters G and K are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7, letters S and Z are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8, letters E and K are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 9, letters C and R are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 10, letter F is incorrect and too early, V is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n   Conclusion: The letters must be V and Y, with V in the third position and Y in the fourth position.\n\nCombining the conclusions from the numbers and letters analysis, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"9\", \"5\", \"V\", \"Y\"] >>>"
