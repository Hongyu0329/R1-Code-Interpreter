    "To deduce the correct password, we need to analyze each guess and its feedback step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 95VB**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Analysis: \n     - One of the numbers 9 or 5 is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - The other number is incorrect.\n     - Both letters V and B are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 34OH**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - Analysis:\n     - Numbers 3 and 4 are incorrect.\n     - One letter (O or H) is correct and in the correct position.\n     - The other letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 63TK**\n   - Feedback: Both numbers are incorrect; both letters are incorrect.\n   - Analysis:\n     - Numbers 6 and 3 are incorrect.\n     - Letters T and K are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 61XN**\n   - Feedback: One number is correct but in the wrong position; one number is incorrect; one letter is correct and in the correct position; one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - Analysis:\n     - One of the numbers 6 or 1 is correct but in the wrong position.\n     - The other number is incorrect.\n     - One letter (X or N) is correct and in the correct position.\n     - The other letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n- From guesses 2 and 3, numbers 3, 4, and 6 are incorrect. Therefore, the correct numbers must be 9 and 1 (from guesses 1 and 4).\n- From guess 1, since one number is correct but in the wrong position, and from guess 4, one number is correct but in the wrong position, the numbers must be 1 and 9, but not in the positions they were guessed in.\n- From guess 2, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since O is not too early in the alphabet, O is correct and in the correct position.\n- From guess 4, one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since N is too late in the alphabet, X is correct and in the correct position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The correct numbers are 1 and 9, but they need to be swapped from their guessed positions.\n- The correct letters are O and X, with O in the second position and X in the third position.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [\"9\", \"1\", \"O\", \"X\"] >>>"
