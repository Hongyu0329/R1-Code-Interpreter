    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. **Guess: 25KS**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 26BP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 39ON**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Analyzing the Information:\n\n- From Guess 1, we know that numbers 2 and 5, and letters K and S are not in the combination.\n- From Guess 2, numbers 2 and 6 are not in the combination. One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. This means one of B or P is correct, but P is too late in the alphabet.\n- From Guess 3, one of the numbers 3 or 9 is correct but in the wrong position, and the other number is incorrect and too small. This means the correct number is 9, but it should be in the first position. One of the letters O or N is correct but in the wrong position, and the other letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. This means the correct letter is O, but it should be in the first position.\n\n### Deducing the Correct Combination:\n\n- The correct number in the first position is 9 (from Guess 3).\n- The correct letter in the first position is O (from Guess 3).\n- The second number must be greater than 3 (since 3 is too small) and not 2, 5, 6, or 9. The possible numbers are 4, 7, or 8.\n- The second letter must be earlier in the alphabet than P and not K, S, or N. The possible letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L, M.\n\nLet's use Python to find the correct combination.\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the deductions\npossible_numbers = [4, 7, 8]\npossible_letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'L', 'M']\n\n# Iterate over possible combinations\nfor num2 in possible_numbers:\n    for letter2 in possible_letters:\n        # Check if the combination satisfies all conditions\n        if letter2 != 'O' and letter2 < 'P':\n            print([9, num2, 'O', letter2])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code output provides multiple possible combinations, but we need to narrow it down to the correct one based on the feedback from the guesses.\n\n### Further Analysis:\n\n- From Guess 2, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet. Since 'O' is already determined to be correct from Guess 3, the correct letter from Guess 2 must be 'B', but it should be in the second position.\n- From Guess 3, the second number must be greater than 3 and not 2, 5, 6, or 9. The possible numbers are 4, 7, or 8. Since '9' is in the first position, the second number must be 8 (as 4 and 7 do not satisfy the condition of being greater than 3 and not being too small).\n\nThus, the correct combination is [9, 8, 'O', 'B'].\n\n<<< [9, 8, 'O', 'B'] >>>"
