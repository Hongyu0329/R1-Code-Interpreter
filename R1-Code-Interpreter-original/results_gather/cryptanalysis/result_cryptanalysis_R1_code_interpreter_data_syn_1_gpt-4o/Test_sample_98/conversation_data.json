    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guess 10 (48QW), both numbers are correct and in the correct positions. Therefore, the numbers are 4 and 8.\n   - From guess 5 (86YC), one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 8 is in the second position in guess 10, it must be in the first position in the correct combination.\n   - From guess 9 (54WB), one number is correct but in the wrong position. Since 4 is in the first position in guess 10, it must be in the second position in the correct combination.\n\n   Therefore, the correct numbers are 8 and 4, in that order.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 5 (86YC), one letter is correct and in the correct position. Since Y is in the second position, it must be the correct letter in the second position.\n   - From guess 8 (87ZL), both letters are incorrect, confirming that Z and L are not part of the combination.\n   - From guess 11 (86UT), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that U and T are not part of the combination.\n   - From guess 1 (75QG), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that Q and G are not part of the combination.\n   - From guess 2 (30KJ), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that K and J are not part of the combination.\n   - From guess 3 (97KP), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that K and P are not part of the combination.\n   - From guess 6 (91MS), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet, confirming that M and S are not part of the combination.\n   - From guess 7 (31WR), both letters are incorrect, confirming that W and R are not part of the combination.\n   - From guess 9 (54WB), both letters are incorrect, confirming that W and B are not part of the combination.\n   - From guess 10 (48QW), both letters are incorrect, confirming that Q and W are not part of the combination.\n\n   The only letter that fits the criteria and hasn't been ruled out is X. Therefore, the correct letters are X and Y, in that order.\n\nNow, let's compile the final answer:\n\n<<< [\"8\", \"4\", \"X\", \"Y\"] >>>"
