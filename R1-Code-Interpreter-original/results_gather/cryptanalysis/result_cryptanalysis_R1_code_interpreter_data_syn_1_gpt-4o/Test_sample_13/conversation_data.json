    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 95VB**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   \n   From this, we know that one of the numbers 9 or 5 is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect. Both letters V and B are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 34OH**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   \n   Since both numbers 3 and 4 are incorrect, the correct numbers must be from the set {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8}. One of the letters O or H is correct and in the correct position, and the other is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 63TK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n   \n   Numbers 6 and 3 are incorrect, so the correct numbers must be from the set {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}. Letters T and K are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 61XN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   \n   From this, we know that one of the numbers 6 or 1 is correct but in the wrong position, and the other is incorrect. One of the letters X or N is correct and in the correct position, and the other is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nNow, let's deduce the correct numbers and letters:\n\n- From conditions 2 and 3, the correct numbers must be from {0, 7, 8}.\n- From conditions 1 and 4, the correct numbers must be from {1, 9}.\n\nThe intersection of these sets gives us the possible numbers: {1, 8}.\n\n- From conditions 2 and 4, the correct letters must be from {O, X}.\n- From conditions 1 and 3, the correct letters must be from {O, H}.\n\nThe intersection of these sets gives us the possible letters: {O, X}.\n\nNow, let's determine the correct positions:\n\n- From condition 2, O is in the correct position.\n- From condition 4, X is in the correct position.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 8, 1, O, X.\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on deductions\npossible_numbers = [1, 8]\npossible_letters = ['O', 'X']\n\n# Verify the combination\ncombination = [8, 1, 'O', 'X']\n\n# Check against each condition\ndef check_combination(combination):\n    # Condition 1: 95VB\n    if (combination[0] in [9, 5] and combination[0] != 9) or (combination[1] in [9, 5] and combination[1] != 5):\n        if combination[2] not in ['V', 'B'] and combination[3] not in ['V', 'B']:\n            # Condition 2: 34OH\n            if combination[0] not in [3, 4] and combination[1] not in [3, 4]:\n                if combination[2] == 'O' and combination[3] not in ['H']:\n                    # Condition 3: 63TK\n                    if combination[0] not in [6, 3] and combination[1] not in [6, 3]:\n                        if combination[2] not in ['T', 'K'] and combination[3] not in ['T', 'K']:\n                            # Condition 4: 61XN\n                            if (combination[0] in [6, 1] and combination[0] != 6) or (combination[1] in [6, 1] and combination[1] != 1):\n                                if combination[2] == 'X' and combination[3] not in ['N']:\n                                    return True\n    return False\n\n# Check if the combination is correct\nis_correct = check_combination(combination)\nprint(is_correct)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the solution.",
