    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the 12 guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 71HT**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 19ZS**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 48PA**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 49FO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n5. **Guess: 25IP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n6. **Guess: 76KR**\n   - Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n7. **Guess: 17BY**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n8. **Guess: 31ZP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n9. **Guess: 02NE**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n10. **Guess: 36ZF**\n    - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One number is incorrect and too small.\n    - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n11. **Guess: 26SR**\n    - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One number is incorrect and too small.\n    - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n    - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n12. **Guess: 65FG**\n    - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n    - One number is incorrect and too small.\n    - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n    - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The correct numbers are 7 and 6, as indicated by guess 6.\n- The correct letters are deduced from the feedback of guesses 6, 11, and 12.\n\nLet's write a Python script to help us deduce the correct letters based on the feedback.\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the feedback\npossible_numbers = [7, 6]\npossible_letters = ['K', 'R', 'G']\n\n# We know from guess 6 that one letter is correct but in the wrong position\n# From guess 12, we know one letter is correct and in the correct position\n\n# Let's deduce the correct letters\nfor letter1 in possible_letters:\n    for letter2 in possible_letters:\n        if letter1 != letter2:\n            # Check against the feedback\n            if (letter1 == 'K' and letter2 == 'R') or (letter1 == 'R' and letter2 == 'K'):\n                # This combination satisfies the feedback from guess 6\n                print([7, 6, letter1, letter2])\n```\n\nThis script will help us find the correct combination of letters. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "Based on the code output, we have two potential combinations for the letters: 'K' and 'R'. The feedback from the guesses suggests that one of these combinations is correct. Let's analyze the feedback again to determine the correct order:\n\n- From guess 6 (76KR), we know that both numbers are correct and in the correct positions, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect.\n- From guess 12 (65FG), we know that one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nGiven these conditions, the correct combination of letters is 'R' and 'K', with 'R' being in the correct position in guess 6. Therefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [7, 6, 'R', 'K'] >>>"
