    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the 14 guesses. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From guesses 1, 5, 13: Numbers 7, 9, 8 are too large.\n   - From guesses 2, 9: Numbers 3, 2, 1 are too small.\n   - From guess 4: One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 6: One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 7: One number is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 8: Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions.\n   - From guess 10: One number is correct but in the wrong position, and one is incorrect and too large.\n   - From guesses 11, 12, 14: Numbers 7, 0 are incorrect.\n\n   From guess 8, we know the numbers are 4 and 5, and they are in the correct positions.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 1: Letters F, V are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2: Letters P, Z are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 3: Letters E, F are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 4: Letters Q, D are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5: Letters O, J are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6: Letter L is correct and in the correct position, Y is incorrect and too late.\n   - From guess 7: Letters H, I are incorrect and too early.\n   - From guess 8: Letters T, G are incorrect.\n   - From guess 9: Letters I, B are incorrect and too early.\n   - From guess 10: Letters V, W are incorrect and too late.\n   - From guess 11: Letters X, N are incorrect and too late.\n   - From guess 12: Letters B, I are incorrect and too early.\n   - From guess 13: Letters U, G are incorrect.\n   - From guess 14: Letters K, G are incorrect and too early.\n\n   From guess 6, we know L is correct and in the correct position. The other letter must be between L and T in the alphabet, and it cannot be Q, D, O, J, T, G, U, K, or G. The only letter that fits is M.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 4, 5, L, M.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure all conditions are met.\n\n```python\n# Define the possible numbers and letters based on the conditions\nnumbers = [4, 5]\nletters = ['L', 'M']\n\n# Check each condition\nconditions_met = [\n    # Guess 1: 79FV\n    (79, 'FV', False),\n    # Guess 2: 32PZ\n    (32, 'PZ', False),\n    # Guess 3: 09EF\n    (9, 'EF', False),\n    # Guess 4: 58QD\n    (58, 'QD', False),\n    # Guess 5: 79OJ\n    (79, 'OJ', False),\n    # Guess 6: 64LY\n    (64, 'LY', False),\n    # Guess 7: 48HI\n    (48, 'HI', False),\n    # Guess 8: 45TG\n    (45, 'TG', True),\n    # Guess 9: 31IB\n    (31, 'IB', False),\n    # Guess 10: 94VW\n    (94, 'VW', False),\n    # Guess 11: 70XN\n    (70, 'XN', False),\n    # Guess 12: 70BI\n    (70, 'BI', False),\n    # Guess 13: 89UG\n    (89, 'UG', False),\n    # Guess 14: 70KG\n    (70, 'KG', False)\n]\n\n# Check if the combination 45LM meets all conditions\ncombination = (45, 'LM')\nis_correct = all(\n    (combination[0] != guess[0] or combination[1] != guess[1]) == guess[2]\n    for guess in conditions_met\n)\n\nprint(is_correct)\n```\n\nThe code will check if the combination 45LM meets all the conditions. If it returns `True`, then 45LM is the correct combination.\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm.",

We need to ensure that the combination 45LM satisfies all the feedback conditions given.\n\nLet's re-implement the logic to check each condition properly:\n\n1. For each guess, we need to check if the numbers and letters match the feedback.\n2. If a guess is supposed to be incorrect, the combination should not match it.\n3.
