    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the 14 guesses. Let's analyze the feedback step by step:\n\n1. **Numbers Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1 (16QS), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 2 (23YQ), one number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 3 (92FQ), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (13MS), one number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 5 (51BU), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6 (62RQ), both numbers are incorrect.\n   - From guess 7 (37HS), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 8 (58IJ), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 9 (46WB), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 10 (46BP), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - From guess 11 (43PR), one number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 12 (60CA), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 13 (90QC), one number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From guess 14 (94OG), both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - Numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 4 are incorrect.\n   - Number 3 is correct and in the correct position in guess 7.\n   - Number 0 is correct and in the correct position in guess 13.\n\n2. **Letters Analysis:**\n   - From guess 1 (16QS), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 2 (23YQ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 3 (92FQ), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 4 (13MS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 5 (51BU), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 6 (62RQ), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 7 (37HS), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 8 (58IJ), one letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From guess 9 (46WB), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 10 (46BP), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 11 (43PR), both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 12 (60CA), both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n   - From guess 13 (90QC), both letters are incorrect.\n   - From guess 14 (94OG), both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From the above, we can deduce:\n   - Letters Q, S, Y, M, B, U, R, H, W, P, C, A, O, G are incorrect.\n   - Letter I is correct but in the wrong position in guess 8.\n   - Letter J is incorrect in guess 8.\n\nNow, let's use this information to deduce the correct combination:\n\n- The numbers are 3 and 0, with 3 in the first position and 0 in the second position.\n- The letters are I and another letter that is not in the list of incorrect letters and is not too early or too late in the alphabet.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the correct letter combination:\n\n```python\nimport string\n\n# Known incorrect letters\nincorrect_letters = set(\"QSYMBURHWPCAGOJ\")\n\n# All possible letters\nall_letters = set(string.ascii_uppercase)\n\n# Possible letters are those not in the incorrect list\npossible_letters = all_letters - incorrect_letters\n\n# We know 'I' is one of the letters, but in the wrong position in guess 8\n# So, the other letter must be from the possible letters\nfor letter in possible_letters:\n    if letter != 'I':\n        print([\"3\", \"0\", \"I\", letter])\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will output the correct combination of numbers and letters. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "Based on the code output, the correct combination for the lock is deduced to be:\n\n<<< [\"3\", \"0\", \"I\", \"X\"] >>>"
