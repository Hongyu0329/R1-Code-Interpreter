    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 56QS**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 47KB**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 83CN**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 35JX**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 95FG**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n- From guess 2, we know that numbers 4 and 7, and letters K and B are not in the password.\n- From guess 1, since one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect, we can deduce that either 5 or 6 is correct. Since 5 is in the same position in guess 5 and is incorrect, 6 must be correct and in the first position.\n- From guess 3, since one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small, 8 is incorrect and too small, so 3 is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 4, since one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too small, 3 is correct but in the wrong position, confirming 3 is the second number.\n- From guess 5, since one number is correct but in the wrong position, and one number is incorrect and too large, 9 is incorrect, confirming 3 is the second number.\n- From guess 1, both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet, so Q and S are not in the password.\n- From guess 3, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect and too late, C is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 4, both letters are incorrect and too late, J and X are not in the password.\n- From guess 5, one letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect, F is incorrect, confirming C is correct but in the wrong position.\n- From guess 5, G is incorrect, confirming C is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nNow, let's use Python to find the correct combination:\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the analysis\npossible_numbers = [6, 3]\npossible_letters = ['C']\n\n# Remaining letters that are not too late in the alphabet and not used\nremaining_letters = [chr(i) for i in range(ord('A'), ord('C'))]  # A, B\n\n# Since B is incorrect from guess 2, the remaining letter is A\npossible_letters.append('A')\n\n# The correct combination based on the analysis\ncorrect_combination = [possible_numbers[0], possible_numbers[1], possible_letters[1], possible_letters[0]]\n\nprint(correct_combination)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the correct combination.",
    "Based on the analysis and the code execution, the correct password combination is:\n\n<<< [6, 3, 'A', 'C'] >>>"
