    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Guess: 97EJ**\n   - Both numbers (9 and 7) are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 43OM**\n   - Both numbers (4 and 3) are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters (O and M) are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 20BQ**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the feedback, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The numbers must be less than 4 (since 4 is too large).\n- The correct number from the third guess is either 2 or 0, but in the wrong position.\n- The letters must be earlier in the alphabet than O, M, B, and Q.\n- The correct letter from the first guess is either E or J, but in the wrong position.\n- The correct letter from the third guess is either B or Q, but in the wrong position.\n\nLet's use this information to find the correct combination. We will write a Python script to iterate through possible combinations and check them against the conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the feedback\npossible_numbers = [0, 1, 2]\npossible_letters = ['A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'N']\n\n# Function to check if a combination is valid\ndef is_valid_combination(numbers, letters):\n    # Check against the first guess\n    if numbers[0] >= 9 or numbers[1] >= 9:\n        return False\n    if letters[0] not in ['E', 'J'] and letters[1] not in ['E', 'J']:\n        return False\n    if letters[0] in ['E', 'J'] and letters[1] in ['E', 'J']:\n        return False\n\n    # Check against the second guess\n    if numbers[0] >= 4 or numbers[1] >= 4:\n        return False\n    if letters[0] in ['O', 'M'] or letters[1] in ['O', 'M']:\n        return False\n\n    # Check against the third guess\n    if numbers[0] not in [2, 0] and numbers[1] not in [2, 0]:\n        return False\n    if numbers[0] in [2, 0] and numbers[1] in [2, 0]:\n        return False\n    if letters[0] not in ['B', 'Q'] and letters[1] not in ['B', 'Q']:\n        return False\n    if letters[0] in ['B', 'Q'] and letters[1] in ['B', 'Q']:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Iterate through all permutations of numbers and letters\nfor num_perm in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for let_perm in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        if is_valid_combination(num_perm, let_perm):\n            print(list(num_perm) + list(let_perm))\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will check all possible combinations of numbers and letters and print the valid one based on the given conditions. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
