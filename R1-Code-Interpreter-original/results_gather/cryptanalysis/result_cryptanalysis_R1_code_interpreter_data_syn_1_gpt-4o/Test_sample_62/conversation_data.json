    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 13GO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 1, 3 are not in the password.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: G or O is correct.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet: G or O is incorrect and too early.\n\n2. **Guess: 26LC**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: 2 or 6 is correct.\n   - One number is incorrect: 2 or 6 is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: L, C are not in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 95SX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 9, 5 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet: S, X are not in the password.\n\n4. **Guess: 94UG**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 9, 4 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: U, G are not in the password.\n\n5. **Guess: 12AT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 1, 2 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: A, T are not in the password.\n\n6. **Guess: 61KJ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect: 1 is not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: K, J are not in the password.\n\n7. **Guess: 56GL**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position: 5 or 6 is correct.\n   - One number is incorrect: 5 or 6 is incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: G, L are not in the password.\n\n8. **Guess: 37BM**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 3, 7 are not in the password.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: B, M are not in the password.\n\n9. **Guess: 24IW**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: 2, 4 are not in the password.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: I or W is correct.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet: I or W is incorrect and too late.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n- The correct numbers are 6 and another number that is not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.\n- The correct letters are not G, O, L, C, S, X, U, A, T, K, J, B, M.\n- The correct letters are I or W, with one being correct and in the correct position.\n\nLet's use Python to find the correct combination.\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters\npossible_numbers = [0, 6, 8]\npossible_letters = ['E', 'F', 'H', 'I', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'W']\n\n# We know 6 is in the correct position from guess 6\n# We need to find the other number and the two letters\n\n# Iterate over possible numbers and letters to find the correct combination\nfor num1 in possible_numbers:\n    for num2 in possible_numbers:\n        if num1 != num2:  # Numbers must not repeat\n            for letter1 in possible_letters:\n                for letter2 in possible_letters:\n                    if letter1 != letter2:  # Letters must not repeat\n                        # Check conditions\n                        if (num1 == 6 or num2 == 6) and (num1 != 6 or num2 != 6):\n                            if (letter1 == 'I' or letter2 == 'I') and (letter1 != 'W' and letter2 != 'W'):\n                                print([num1, num2, letter1, letter2])\n```\n\nThe code will output the correct combination based on the conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output provides multiple possible combinations, but we need to narrow it down to a single correct answer based on the conditions. Let's analyze the results:\n\n1. **Numbers:**\n   - From the conditions, we know that 6 is in the correct position (from guess 6).\n   - The other number must be 0 or 8, as these are the only numbers not eliminated by the conditions.\n\n2. **Letters:**\n   - From guess 9, we know one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n   - The letter 'I' is correct and in the correct position (from guess 9).\n   - The other letter must be earlier in the alphabet than 'W', which eliminates 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', and 'W'.\n\nGiven these deductions, the correct combination is likely to be [6, 8, 'I', 'E'] or [6, 8, 'I', 'F'], as these satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<< [6, 8, 'I', 'E'] >>>"
