    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 91SF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 03HF**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n3. **Guess: 75CP**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 64YB**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From Guess 1, since both numbers are incorrect, the numbers cannot be 9 or 1. One letter is correct and in the correct position, and one letter is incorrect. So, either S or F is correct and in the correct position.\n\n- From Guess 2, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect and too small. Since 0 is too small, it cannot be part of the combination. Therefore, 3 is correct and in the correct position. Both letters H and F are incorrect.\n\n- From Guess 3, both numbers are incorrect, so the numbers cannot be 7 or 5. One letter is correct but in the wrong position, and one letter is incorrect. So, either C or P is correct but in the wrong position.\n\n- From Guess 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and one number is incorrect. Since 6 is incorrect, 4 is correct and in the correct position. Both letters Y and B are incorrect.\n\nFrom the above deductions, we know:\n- The numbers are 3 and 4, with 3 in the first position and 4 in the second position.\n- The correct letter from Guess 1 is either S or F, and it is in the correct position.\n- The correct letter from Guess 3 is either C or P, but it is in the wrong position.\n\nNow, let's use Python to find the correct combination:\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on deductions\nnumbers = [3, 4]\nletters = ['S', 'F', 'C', 'P']\n\n# Check each combination of numbers and letters\nfor num1 in numbers:\n    for num2 in numbers:\n        if num1 != num2:  # Numbers must not repeat\n            for letter1 in letters:\n                for letter2 in letters:\n                    if letter1 != letter2:  # Letters must not repeat\n                        # Check conditions\n                        if (num1 == 3 and num2 == 4) and (letter1 == 'S' or letter2 == 'S') and (letter1 == 'C' or letter2 == 'C'):\n                            print([num1, num2, letter1, letter2])\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code output indicates two possible combinations: [3, 4, 'S', 'C'] and [3, 4, 'C', 'S']. We need to determine which one satisfies all the conditions given.\n\nLet's analyze these two combinations:\n\n1. **Combination [3, 4, 'S', 'C']**\n   - From Guess 1 (91SF): 'S' is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From Guess 2 (03HF): 3 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From Guess 3 (75CP): 'C' is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From Guess 4 (64YB): 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n\n2. **Combination [3, 4, 'C', 'S']**\n   - From Guess 1 (91SF): 'S' is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - From Guess 2 (03HF): 3 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From Guess 3 (75CP): 'C' is correct and in the correct position.\n   - From Guess 4 (64YB): 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n\nThe first combination [3, 4, 'S', 'C'] satisfies all the conditions:\n- 'S' is in the correct position as per Guess 1.\n- 3 is in the correct position as per Guess 2.\n- 'C' is in the wrong position as per Guess 3.\n- 4 is in the correct position as per Guess 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is:\n\n<<< [3, 4, 'S', 'C'] >>>"
