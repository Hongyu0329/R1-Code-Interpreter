    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the four guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 35PQ**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - One of the numbers 3 or 5 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number is too large, so it must be 5 (since 3 is smaller).\n   - Both letters P and Q are incorrect and too late, so the correct letters are earlier in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 24XE**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - One of the numbers 2 or 4 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other number is too small, so it must be 2 (since 4 is larger).\n   - One letter X or E is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The other letter is too late, so it must be E (since X is earlier).\n\n3. **Guess: 96SQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Numbers 9 and 6 are too large, so the correct numbers are smaller.\n   - Letters S and Q are too late, so the correct letters are earlier.\n\n4. **Guess: 25XC**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Numbers 2 and 5 are incorrect.\n   - One letter X or C is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The other letter is too late, so it must be C (since X is earlier).\n\nFrom the above deductions, we can conclude:\n- The correct numbers are smaller than 5 and 6, and one of them is 3 (from the first guess).\n- The correct letters are earlier than P, Q, S, and C, and one of them is X (from the second guess).\n\nLet's use Python to find the correct combination.\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on deductions\npossible_numbers = [0, 1, 3, 4]\npossible_letters = ['A', 'B', 'D', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'X']\n\n# Check each combination of numbers and letters\nfor num1 in possible_numbers:\n    for num2 in possible_numbers:\n        if num1 != num2:  # Numbers must not repeat\n            for letter1 in possible_letters:\n                for letter2 in possible_letters:\n                    if letter1 != letter2:  # Letters must not repeat\n                        # Check against all conditions\n                        if (num1 == 3 or num2 == 3) and (num1 < 5 and num2 < 5) and \\\n                           (letter1 == 'X' or letter2 == 'X') and \\\n                           (letter1 < 'P' and letter2 < 'P'):\n                            print([num1, num2, letter1, letter2])\n```\n\nThis code will check all possible combinations of numbers and letters that satisfy the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the correct combination."
