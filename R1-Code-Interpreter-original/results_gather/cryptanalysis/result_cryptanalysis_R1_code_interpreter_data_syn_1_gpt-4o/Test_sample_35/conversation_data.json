    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 14LZ**\n   - Both numbers (1 and 4) are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters (L and Z) are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 28EP**\n   - Both numbers (2 and 8) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (E or P) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 14RW**\n   - Both numbers (1 and 4) are correct but in the wrong positions.\n   - Both letters (R and W) are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 70XH**\n   - Both numbers (7 and 0) are incorrect.\n   - One letter (X or H) is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The correct numbers are 1 and 4, but they need to be swapped in position.\n- The correct letters are not L, Z, R, W, or P.\n- One of the letters is E or X, and it is in the correct position in the second guess (E) or the fourth guess (X).\n- The incorrect letter in the second guess (P) and the fourth guess (H) is too early in the alphabet, meaning the correct letter is later than P and H.\n\nLet's deduce the correct combination:\n\n- The numbers are 4 and 1 (since they need to be swapped from the first and third guesses).\n- The correct letter from the second guess is E, as it is in the correct position.\n- The correct letter from the fourth guess is X, as it is in the correct position.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 41EX.\n\nLet's verify this by checking the conditions:\n\n- For the first guess (14LZ), 4 and 1 are correct but swapped, and L and Z are incorrect.\n- For the second guess (28EP), 2 and 8 are incorrect, E is correct and in the correct position, and P is incorrect and too early.\n- For the third guess (14RW), 4 and 1 are correct but swapped, and R and W are incorrect.\n- For the fourth guess (70XH), 7 and 0 are incorrect, X is correct and in the correct position, and H is incorrect and too early.\n\nThe combination 41EX satisfies all the conditions.\n\n<<< [\"4\", \"1\", \"E\", \"X\"] >>>"
