# Possible numbers and letters based on deductions
possible_numbers = [9, 3]
possible_letters = ['H']

# Since we know the numbers and letters, we can deduce the positions
# 9 and 3 are correct but misplaced, so we need to swap their positions
# H is correct and in the correct position

# The correct combination is:
# Number 1: 3 (since 9 is misplaced in Guess 2)
# Number 2: 9 (since 3 is misplaced in Guess 5)
# Letter 1: H (correct and in the correct position)
# Letter 2: We need to find a letter later in the alphabet than T

# Let's find the letter later than T
import string

# Find the letter later than T
alphabet = string.ascii_uppercase
for letter in alphabet:
    if letter > 'T' and letter not in ['W', 'U', 'M', 'F', 'S', 'U', 'H']:
        possible_letters.append(letter)
        break

# The final combination
combination = [3, 9, possible_letters[0], possible_letters[1]]
print(combination)
