# Possible numbers and letters based on deductions
possible_numbers = [7, 2]
possible_letters = ['H', 'Z']

# We know the positions from the deductions
# Number 2 is in the first position, and letter Z is in the second position
# So the combination is [2, 7, 'H', 'Z']

# Print the final answer
print([2, 7, 'H', 'Z'])
