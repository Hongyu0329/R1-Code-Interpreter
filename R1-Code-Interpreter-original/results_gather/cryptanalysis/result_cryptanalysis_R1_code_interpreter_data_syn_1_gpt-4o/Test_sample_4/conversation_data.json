    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 41CK**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 64DE**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 87JY**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n4. **Guess: 12OD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From Guess 3, numbers 8 and 7, and letters J and Y are not in the password.\n- From Guess 4, numbers 1 and 2 are too small, so the numbers must be greater than 2.\n- From Guess 2, letters D and E are too early in the alphabet, so the letters must be later than E.\n- From Guess 1, letter C is correct but in the wrong position, and letter K is incorrect and too early, so the letters must be later than K.\n\nNow, let's use this information to find the correct combination. We will write a Python script to iterate through possible combinations and check them against the conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the conditions\npossible_numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6, 9]  # Numbers greater than 2 and not 8, 7, 1, 2\npossible_letters = ['F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Z']  # Letters later than K\n\n# Function to check if a combination satisfies all conditions\ndef check_combination(numbers, letters):\n    # Check against Guess 1: 41CK\n    if not ((numbers[0] == 4 and numbers[1] != 1) or (numbers[1] == 4 and numbers[0] != 1)):\n        return False\n    if not (letters[0] == 'C' or letters[1] == 'C'):\n        return False\n    if letters[0] == 'K' or letters[1] == 'K':\n        return False\n\n    # Check against Guess 2: 64DE\n    if not ((numbers[0] == 6 and numbers[1] != 4) or (numbers[1] == 6 and numbers[0] != 4)):\n        return False\n    if letters[0] in ['D', 'E'] or letters[1] in ['D', 'E']:\n        return False\n\n    # Check against Guess 3: 87JY\n    if numbers[0] in [8, 7] or numbers[1] in [8, 7]:\n        return False\n    if letters[0] in ['J', 'Y'] or letters[1] in ['J', 'Y']:\n        return False\n\n    # Check against Guess 4: 12OD\n    if numbers[0] in [1, 2] or numbers[1] in [1, 2]:\n        return False\n    if not (letters[0] == 'O' or letters[1] == 'O'):\n        return False\n    if letters[0] == 'D' or letters[1] == 'D':\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Iterate through all permutations of the possible numbers and letters\nfor num_perm in permutations(possible_numbers, 2):\n    for let_perm in permutations(possible_letters, 2):\n        if check_combination(num_perm, let_perm):\n            print(list(num_perm) + list(let_perm))\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will find the correct combination of numbers and letters that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer."
