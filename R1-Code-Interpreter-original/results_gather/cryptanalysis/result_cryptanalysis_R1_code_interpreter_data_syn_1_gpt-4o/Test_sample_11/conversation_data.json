    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the given feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 28MV**\n   - Both numbers are correct and in the correct positions: This means the numbers are 2 and 8.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position: Either M or V is correct.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet: The incorrect letter is earlier in the alphabet than the correct one.\n\n2. **Guess: 41FX**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Confirms that 2 and 8 are the correct numbers.\n   - Both letters are incorrect: Neither F nor X is in the password.\n\n3. **Guess: 58VP**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position: Since 8 is in the second position, it must be correct.\n   - One number is incorrect and incorrect: 5 is incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: Either V or P is correct but misplaced.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet: The incorrect letter is earlier in the alphabet than the correct one.\n\n4. **Guess: 93IT**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect: Confirms that 2 and 8 are the correct numbers.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position: Either I or T is correct but misplaced.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet: The incorrect letter is earlier in the alphabet than the correct one.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we know:\n- The numbers are 2 and 8.\n- The correct letter from the first guess is either M or V.\n- The correct letter from the third guess is either V or P.\n- The correct letter from the fourth guess is either I or T.\n\nLet's deduce the correct letters:\n- From the first guess, if M is correct, V is incorrect and too early, so the correct letter from the third guess must be P.\n- From the fourth guess, if I is correct, T is incorrect and too early, so the correct letter from the first guess must be M.\n\nThus, the letters are M and P, with M in the correct position from the first guess.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to verify and deduce the correct positions of the letters:\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the analysis\nnumbers = [2, 8]\nletters = ['M', 'P']\n\n# Check all possible combinations of the letters\nfor z in letters:\n    for w in letters:\n        if z != w:\n            # Check the conditions\n            if (z == 'M' and w == 'P') or (z == 'P' and w == 'M'):\n                print([numbers[0], numbers[1], z, w])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "Based on the code output, we have two possible combinations for the password: [2, 8, 'M', 'P'] and [2, 8, 'P', 'M']. \n\nLet's analyze these possibilities with the feedback:\n\n- For [2, 8, 'M', 'P']:\n  - From the first guess (28MV), M is in the correct position.\n  - From the third guess (58VP), P is in the wrong position, which matches the feedback.\n\n- For [2, 8, 'P', 'M']:\n  - From the first guess (28MV), M is in the wrong position, which contradicts the feedback.\n\nTherefore, the correct password is [2, 8, 'M', 'P'].\n\n<<< [2, 8, 'M', 'P'] >>>"
