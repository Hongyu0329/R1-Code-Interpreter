    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Guess: 03OQ**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Guess: 76EC**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 83FO**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 47OF**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 87LK**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From conditions 1 and 2, the possible numbers are between 4 and 6.\n- From condition 4, one number is correct and in the correct position, and the other is too large. This suggests that 4 is the correct number in the first position.\n- From condition 3, one letter is correct and in the correct position, and one is incorrect and too late. Since 'O' is too late, 'F' must be the correct letter in the third position.\n- From condition 4, 'O' is correct but in the wrong position, and 'F' is incorrect and too late. This suggests 'O' is the correct letter in the second position.\n- From condition 5, 'L' is correct and in the correct position, and 'K' is incorrect and too late. This suggests 'L' is the correct letter in the fourth position.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The first number is 4.\n- The second number is 5 (since 6 is too large).\n- The first letter is 'O'.\n- The second letter is 'L'.\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script to ensure all conditions are satisfied.\n\n```python\n# Possible numbers and letters based on the conditions\npossible_numbers = [4, 5]\npossible_letters = ['O', 'L']\n\n# Check each condition\ndef check_conditions(numbers, letters):\n    # Condition 1: 03OQ\n    if numbers[0] <= 0 or numbers[1] <= 3 or letters[0] >= 'O' or letters[1] >= 'Q':\n        return False\n    # Condition 2: 76EC\n    if numbers[0] >= 7 or numbers[1] >= 6 or letters[0] <= 'E' or letters[1] <= 'C':\n        return False\n    # Condition 3: 83FO\n    if numbers[0] == 8 or numbers[1] == 3 or (letters[0] != 'F' and letters[1] != 'O'):\n        return False\n    # Condition 4: 47OF\n    if numbers[0] != 4 or numbers[1] >= 7 or (letters[0] != 'O' and letters[1] != 'F'):\n        return False\n    # Condition 5: 87LK\n    if numbers[0] >= 8 or numbers[1] >= 7 or (letters[0] != 'L' and letters[1] != 'K'):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Verify the solution\nsolution = [4, 5, 'O', 'L']\nif check_conditions(solution[:2], solution[2:]):\n    print(solution)\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the solution.",
