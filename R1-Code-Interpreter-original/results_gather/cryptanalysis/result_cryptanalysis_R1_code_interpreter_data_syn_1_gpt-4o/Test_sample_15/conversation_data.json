    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Guess: 80YF**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n2. **Guess: 50MH**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Guess: 14TD**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect and too small.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Guess: 76MO**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - Both letters are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Guess: 09ZV**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are correct and in the correct positions.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From Guess 1, the numbers 8 and 0 are incorrect, and the letters Y and F are incorrect.\n- From Guess 2, one of the numbers 5 or 0 is correct and in the correct position. Since 0 is incorrect (from Guess 1 and 5), 5 must be correct and in the first position. The number 0 is incorrect and too small, so the second number must be greater than 0. The letters M and H are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n- From Guess 3, the numbers 1 and 4 are incorrect and too small, so the second number must be greater than 4. The letters T and D are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n- From Guess 4, one of the numbers 7 or 6 is correct and in the correct position. Since 5 is already correct in the first position, 6 must be correct in the second position. The number 7 is incorrect and too large. The letters M and O are incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n- From Guess 5, the numbers 0 and 9 are incorrect. The letters Z and V are correct and in the correct positions.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 56ZV. Let's verify this by checking all conditions:\n\n- 56ZV: \n  - Numbers: 5 is correct and in the correct position, 6 is correct and in the correct position.\n  - Letters: Z is correct and in the correct position, V is correct and in the correct position.\n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<< [\"5\", \"6\", \"Z\", \"V\"] >>>"
