    "To solve this problem, we need to deduce the correct combination of two numbers and two letters based on the feedback from the guesses. Let's analyze each guess and the feedback provided:\n\n1. **Guess: 48TY**\n   - One number is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too large.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too late in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Either 4 or 8 is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect number is too large, so it must be 8.\n   - Either T or Y is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is too late in the alphabet, so it must be Y.\n\n2. **Guess: 61LS**\n   - Both numbers are incorrect.\n   - Both letters are incorrect.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Numbers 6 and 1 are not part of the combination.\n   - Letters L and S are not part of the combination.\n\n3. **Guess: 21KP**\n   - One number is correct and in the correct position.\n   - One number is incorrect and too small.\n   - One letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - One letter is incorrect and too early in the alphabet.\n\n   From this, we can deduce:\n   - Either 2 or 1 is correct and in the correct position.\n   - The incorrect number is too small, so it must be 1.\n   - Either K or P is correct but in the wrong position.\n   - The incorrect letter is too early in the alphabet, so it must be K.\n\nNow, let's summarize the deductions:\n- The correct numbers are 2 and 4 (since 8 is too large, 6 and 1 are incorrect, and 1 is too small).\n- The correct letters are T and P (since Y is too late, L and S are incorrect, and K is too early).\n\nNext, we need to determine the correct positions:\n- From guess 21KP, 2 is in the correct position.\n- From guess 48TY, T is in the wrong position, so it must be the second letter.\n- From guess 21KP, P is in the wrong position, so it must be the first letter.\n\nThus, the correct combination is 2, 4, P, T. Let's verify this with the conditions:\n\n- For 48TY: 4 is correct but in the wrong position, T is correct but in the wrong position.\n- For 61LS: 6 and 1 are incorrect, L and S are incorrect.\n- For 21KP: 2 is correct and in the correct position, P is correct but in the wrong position.\n\nNow, let's finalize the answer:\n\n<<< [\"2\", \"4\", \"P\", \"T\"] >>>"
