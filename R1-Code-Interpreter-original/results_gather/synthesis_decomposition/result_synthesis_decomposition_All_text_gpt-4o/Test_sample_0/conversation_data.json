  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 3 units of crop A, 2 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of methods and the initial quantities of crops A and B. We will apply each method in the given order and track the changes in the quantities of crops A, B, and product X. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 3 units\n   - Crop B: 2 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle 1:**\n   - **Method 1:** Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n     - New quantities:\n       - Crop A: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n       - Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n       - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n   - **Method 2:** Exchange 3 units of crop A for 2 units of product X.\n     - Check if we have enough crop A to perform this method. We need 3 units of crop A, but we only have 2 units. Therefore, Method 2 cannot be executed.\n\n3. **Cycle 2:**\n   - Since Method 2 could not be executed, we start again with Method 1.\n   - **Method 1:** Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n     - New quantities:\n       - Crop A: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n       - Crop B: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n       - Product X: 1 + 1 = 2 units\n\n   - **Method 2:** Again, check if we can execute Method 2. We need 3 units of crop A, but we only have 1 unit. Therefore, Method 2 cannot be executed.\n\n4. **Cycle 3:**\n   - Start again with Method 1.\n   - **Method 1:** Check if we can execute Method 1. We need 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B, but we have 1 unit of crop A and 0 units of crop B. Therefore, Method 1 cannot be executed.\n\nSince neither Method 1 nor Method 2 can be executed anymore, we stop the process here.\n\n**Final State:**\n- Crop A: 1 unit\n- Crop B: 0 units\n- Product X: 2 units\n\nThe final answer, showing the remaining quantities of crops A, B, and the obtained product X, is:\n\n<<<[1, 0, 2]>>>"
