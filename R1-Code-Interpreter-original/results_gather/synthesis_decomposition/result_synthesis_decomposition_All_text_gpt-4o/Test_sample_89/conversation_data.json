  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 5 units of crop B, 4 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods in a cyclic manner. We will keep track of the units of crops A, B, and C, as well as the units of product X obtained. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 4 units\n- Crop B: 5 units\n- Crop C: 4 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle 1:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n- Execution: Yes, we have enough crops.\n- After execution:\n  - Crop A: 3 units (4 - 1)\n  - Crop B: 4 units (5 - 1)\n  - Crop C: 3 units (4 - 1)\n  - Product X: 1 unit (0 + 1)\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n- Execution: Yes, we have enough crops.\n- After execution:\n  - Crop A: 2 units (3 - 1)\n  - Crop B: 3 units (4 - 1)\n  - Crop C: 5 units (3 + 2)\n\n**Method 3:**\n- Requirement: 2 units of C\n- Execution: Yes, we have enough crops.\n- After execution:\n  - Crop A: 2 units\n  - Crop B: 3 units\n  - Crop C: 3 units (5 - 2)\n  - Product X: 2 units (1 + 1)\n\n### Cycle 2:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n- Execution: Yes, we have enough crops.\n- After execution:\n  - Crop A: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n  - Crop B: 2 units (3 - 1)\n  - Crop C: 2 units (3 - 1)\n  - Product X: 3 units (2 + 1)\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n- Execution: Yes, we have enough crops.\n- After execution:\n  - Crop A: 0 units (1 - 1)\n  - Crop B: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n  - Crop C: 4 units (2 + 2)\n\n**Method 3:**\n- Requirement: 2 units of C\n- Execution: Yes, we have enough crops.\n- After execution:\n  - Crop A: 0 units\n  - Crop B: 1 unit\n  - Crop C: 2 units (4 - 2)\n  - Product X: 4 units (3 + 1)\n\n### Cycle 3:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n- Execution: No, we do not have enough units of A (0 units available).\n\nSince we cannot execute Method 1, the cycle stops here.\n\n### Final State:\n- Crop A: 0 units\n- Crop B: 1 unit\n- Crop C: 2 units\n- Product X: 4 units\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[0, 1, 2, 4]>>>"
