  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 5 units of crop A, 6 units of crop B, 3 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the cycle of methods and track the changes in the quantities of crops A, B, C, and product X. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 5 units\n- Crop B: 6 units\n- Crop C: 3 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle Execution:\n\n**Cycle 1:**\n\n1. **Method 1:**\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n   - Execution: Possible\n   - Result: \n     - A: 5 - 1 = 4\n     - B: 6 - 1 = 5\n     - C: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - X: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n2. **Method 2:**\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n   - Execution: Possible\n   - Result:\n     - A: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - B: 5 - 1 = 4\n     - C: 2 + 2 = 4\n     - X: 1 (no change)\n\n3. **Method 3:**\n   - Requirement: 2 units of C\n   - Execution: Possible\n   - Result:\n     - C: 4 - 2 = 2\n     - X: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n**Cycle 2:**\n\n1. **Method 1:**\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n   - Execution: Possible\n   - Result:\n     - A: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - B: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - C: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - X: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n2. **Method 2:**\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n   - Execution: Possible\n   - Result:\n     - A: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - B: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - C: 1 + 2 = 3\n     - X: 3 (no change)\n\n3. **Method 3:**\n   - Requirement: 2 units of C\n   - Execution: Possible\n   - Result:\n     - C: 3 - 2 = 1\n     - X: 3 + 1 = 4\n\n**Cycle 3:**\n\n1. **Method 1:**\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n   - Execution: Possible\n   - Result:\n     - A: 1 - 1 = 0\n     - B: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - C: 1 - 1 = 0\n     - X: 4 + 1 = 5\n\n2. **Method 2:**\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n   - Execution: Not possible (A = 0)\n\nSince Method 2 cannot be executed, the cycle stops here.\n\n### Final State:\n- Crop A: 0 units\n- Crop B: 1 unit\n- Crop C: 0 units\n- Product X: 5 units\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[0, 1, 0, 5]>>>"
