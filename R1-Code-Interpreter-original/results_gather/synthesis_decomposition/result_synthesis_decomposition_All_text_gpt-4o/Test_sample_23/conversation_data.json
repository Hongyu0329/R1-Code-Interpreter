  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 4 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of methods Xiao Li uses to exchange crops for product X and track the remaining units of crops A and B, as well as the total units of product X obtained. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 4 units\n- Crop B: 4 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle 1:\n1. **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n   - Crop A: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n   - Crop B: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n   - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n2. **Method 2**: Exchange 3 units of crop A for 2 units of product X.\n   - Crop A: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n   - Crop B: 3 units (unchanged)\n   - Product X: 1 + 2 = 3 units\n\n### Cycle 2:\n- Start again from Method 1.\n\n1. **Method 1**: Attempt to exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n   - Crop A: 0 units (not enough to perform Method 1)\n   - Crop B: 3 units\n   - Product X: 3 units (unchanged)\n\nSince there are no units of crop A left, Method 1 cannot be executed. Consequently, Method 2 also cannot be executed because it requires 3 units of crop A. Therefore, the cycle cannot continue.\n\n### Final State:\n- Crop A: 0 units\n- Crop B: 3 units\n- Product X: 3 units\n\nThe final answer, showing the remaining units of crops A and B and the total units of product X obtained, is:\n\n<<<[0, 3, 3]>>>"
