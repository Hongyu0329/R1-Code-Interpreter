  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 5 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods, following the cycle of methods until no more exchanges can be made. We will track the units of crops A, B, and C, as well as the units of product X obtained.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- Crop A: 4 units\n- Crop B: 5 units\n- Crop C: 2 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n**Cycle Execution:**\n\n1. **Method 1:**\n   - Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n   - Available: 4 units of A, 5 units of B, 2 units of C\n   - Execution: Possible (since all required units are available)\n   - After execution:\n     - Crop A: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n     - Crop B: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n     - Crop C: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n     - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n2. **Method 2:**\n   - Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n   - Available: 3 units of A, 4 units of B\n   - Execution: Possible (since all required units are available)\n   - After execution:\n     - Crop A: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n     - Crop B: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n     - Crop C: 1 + 2 = 3 units (2 units of C are obtained)\n\n3. **Method 3:**\n   - Requires: 2 units of C\n   - Available: 3 units of C\n   - Execution: Possible (since all required units are available)\n   - After execution:\n     - Crop C: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n     - Product X: 1 + 1 = 2 units\n\n**Start New Cycle:**\n\n4. **Method 1:**\n   - Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n   - Available: 2 units of A, 3 units of B, 1 unit of C\n   - Execution: Possible (since all required units are available)\n   - After execution:\n     - Crop A: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n     - Crop B: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n     - Crop C: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n     - Product X: 2 + 1 = 3 units\n\n5. **Method 2:**\n   - Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n   - Available: 1 unit of A, 2 units of B\n   - Execution: Possible (since all required units are available)\n   - After execution:\n     - Crop A: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n     - Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n     - Crop C: 0 + 2 = 2 units (2 units of C are obtained)\n\n6. **Method 3:**\n   - Requires: 2 units of C\n   - Available: 2 units of C\n   - Execution: Possible (since all required units are available)\n   - After execution:\n     - Crop C: 2 - 2 = 0 units\n     - Product X: 3 + 1 = 4 units\n\n**Attempt New Cycle:**\n\n7. **Method 1:**\n   - Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n   - Available: 0 units of A, 1 unit of B, 0 units of C\n   - Execution: Not possible (since there are no units of A and C)\n\nSince no more methods can be executed, the cycle ends here.\n\n**Final State:**\n- Crop A: 0 units\n- Crop B: 1 unit\n- Crop C: 0 units\n- Product X: 4 units\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[0, 1, 0, 4]>>>"
