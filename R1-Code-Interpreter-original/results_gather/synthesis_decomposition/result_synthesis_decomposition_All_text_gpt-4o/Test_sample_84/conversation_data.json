  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 7 units of crop A, 4 units of crop B, 5 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the cycle of methods Xiao Li uses to exchange his crops for product X. We will go through each method in order, checking if it can be executed with the current stock of crops, and then update the stock accordingly. We will continue this process until no method can be executed.\n\n### Initial Stock:\n- Crop A: 7 units\n- Crop B: 4 units\n- Crop C: 5 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle Execution:\n\n1. **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - Current stock: A = 7, B = 4, C = 5\n   - Execute Method 1:\n     - New stock: A = 6, B = 3, C = 4\n     - Product X = 1\n\n2. **Method 2**: Exchange 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B for 2 units of C.\n   - Current stock: A = 6, B = 3, C = 4\n   - Execute Method 2:\n     - New stock: A = 5, B = 2, C = 6\n     - Product X = 1\n\n3. **Method 3**: Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - Current stock: A = 5, B = 2, C = 6\n   - Execute Method 3:\n     - New stock: A = 5, B = 2, C = 4\n     - Product X = 2\n\n4. **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - Current stock: A = 5, B = 2, C = 4\n   - Execute Method 1:\n     - New stock: A = 4, B = 1, C = 3\n     - Product X = 3\n\n5. **Method 2**: Exchange 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B for 2 units of C.\n   - Current stock: A = 4, B = 1, C = 3\n   - Execute Method 2:\n     - New stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 5\n     - Product X = 3\n\n6. **Method 3**: Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - Current stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 5\n   - Execute Method 3:\n     - New stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 3\n     - Product X = 4\n\n7. **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - Current stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 3\n   - Cannot execute Method 1 because there are no units of B left.\n\n8. **Method 2**: Exchange 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B for 2 units of C.\n   - Current stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 3\n   - Cannot execute Method 2 because there are no units of B left.\n\n9. **Method 3**: Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - Current stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 3\n   - Execute Method 3:\n     - New stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 1\n     - Product X = 5\n\n10. **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n    - Current stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 1\n    - Cannot execute Method 1 because there are no units of B left.\n\n11. **Method 2**: Exchange 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B for 2 units of C.\n    - Current stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 1\n    - Cannot execute Method 2 because there are no units of B left.\n\n12. **Method 3**: Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n    - Current stock: A = 3, B = 0, C = 1\n    - Cannot execute Method 3 because there are not enough units of C.\n\n### Final Stock:\n- Crop A: 3 units\n- Crop B: 0 units\n- Crop C: 1 unit\n- Product X: 5 units\n\nThe cycle cannot continue as no method can be executed with the remaining stock. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 0, 1, 5]>>>"
