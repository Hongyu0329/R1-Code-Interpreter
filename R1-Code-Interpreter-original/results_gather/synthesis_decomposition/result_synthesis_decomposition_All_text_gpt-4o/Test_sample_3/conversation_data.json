  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 5 units of crop A, 2 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of methods Xiao Li can use to exchange his crops for product X. We will go through each method step by step, keeping track of the units of crop A, crop B, and product X.\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 5 units\n- Crop B: 2 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle 1:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n- Execution: Since Xiao Li has 5 units of crop A and 2 units of crop B, he can execute Method 1.\n- Result: \n  - Crop A: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n  - Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n  - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n- Execution: Xiao Li has 4 units of crop A, so he can execute Method 2.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n  - Crop B: 1 unit (unchanged)\n  - Product X: 1 + 2 = 3 units\n\n### Cycle 2:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n- Execution: Xiao Li has 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B, so he can execute Method 1.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n  - Crop B: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n  - Product X: 3 + 1 = 4 units\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n- Execution: Xiao Li has 0 units of crop A, so he cannot execute Method 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- At this point, Xiao Li cannot execute any more methods because he does not have enough units of crop A or crop B to meet the requirements of either method.\n\n### Final State:\n- Remaining Crop A: 0 units\n- Remaining Crop B: 0 units\n- Obtained Product X: 4 units\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[0, 0, 4]>>>"
