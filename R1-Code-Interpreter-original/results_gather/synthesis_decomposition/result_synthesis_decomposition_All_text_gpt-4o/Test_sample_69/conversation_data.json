  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 6 units of crop A, 3 units of crop B, 4 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods and apply them as long as possible. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 6 units\n- Crop B: 3 units\n- Crop C: 4 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle Execution:\n\n**Cycle 1:**\n\n1. **Method 1:** Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - New state:\n     - Crop A: 5 units\n     - Crop B: 2 units\n     - Crop C: 3 units\n     - Product X: 1 unit\n\n2. **Method 2:** Exchange 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B for 2 units of C.\n   - New state:\n     - Crop A: 4 units\n     - Crop B: 1 unit\n     - Crop C: 5 units\n     - Product X: 1 unit\n\n3. **Method 3:** Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - New state:\n     - Crop A: 4 units\n     - Crop B: 1 unit\n     - Crop C: 3 units\n     - Product X: 2 units\n\n**Cycle 2:**\n\n1. **Method 1:** Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - New state:\n     - Crop A: 3 units\n     - Crop B: 0 units\n     - Crop C: 2 units\n     - Product X: 3 units\n\n2. **Method 2:** Cannot execute because there is not enough B (requires 1 unit of B, but we have 0).\n\n3. **Method 3:** Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - New state:\n     - Crop A: 3 units\n     - Crop B: 0 units\n     - Crop C: 0 units\n     - Product X: 4 units\n\n**Cycle 3:**\n\n1. **Method 1:** Cannot execute because there is not enough B (requires 1 unit of B, but we have 0).\n\n2. **Method 2:** Cannot execute because there is not enough B (requires 1 unit of B, but we have 0).\n\n3. **Method 3:** Cannot execute because there is not enough C (requires 2 units of C, but we have 0).\n\n### Final State:\n- Crop A: 3 units\n- Crop B: 0 units\n- Crop C: 0 units\n- Product X: 4 units\n\nThe cycle cannot continue as no method can be executed with the remaining crops. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 0, 0, 4]>>>"
