  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 6 units of crop A, 6 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods, following the cycle of methods until no more exchanges can be made. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 6 units\n- Crop B: 6 units\n- Crop C: 2 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle 1:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n- Available: 6 units of A, 6 units of B, 2 units of C\n- Execution: Possible (since we have enough of each crop)\n- Result: \n  - A: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n  - B: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n  - C: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n  - X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n- Available: 5 units of A, 5 units of B\n- Execution: Possible\n- Result:\n  - A: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n  - B: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n  - C: 1 + 2 = 3 units (since we gain 2 units of C)\n  - X: 1 unit (no change)\n\n**Method 3:**\n- Requires: 2 units of C\n- Available: 3 units of C\n- Execution: Possible\n- Result:\n  - C: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n  - X: 1 + 1 = 2 units\n\n### Cycle 2:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n- Available: 4 units of A, 4 units of B, 1 unit of C\n- Execution: Possible\n- Result:\n  - A: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n  - B: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n  - C: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n  - X: 2 + 1 = 3 units\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B\n- Available: 3 units of A, 3 units of B\n- Execution: Possible\n- Result:\n  - A: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n  - B: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n  - C: 0 + 2 = 2 units\n  - X: 3 units (no change)\n\n**Method 3:**\n- Requires: 2 units of C\n- Available: 2 units of C\n- Execution: Possible\n- Result:\n  - C: 2 - 2 = 0 units\n  - X: 3 + 1 = 4 units\n\n### Cycle 3:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requires: 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, 1 unit of C\n- Available: 2 units of A, 2 units of B, 0 units of C\n- Execution: Not possible (since we have 0 units of C)\n\nSince Method 1 cannot be executed, the cycle stops here.\n\n### Final State:\n- Crop A: 2 units\n- Crop B: 2 units\n- Crop C: 0 units\n- Product X: 4 units\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 2, 0, 4]>>>"
