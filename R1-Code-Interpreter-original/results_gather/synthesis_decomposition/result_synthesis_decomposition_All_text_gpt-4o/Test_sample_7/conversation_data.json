  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 3 units of crop A, 3 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of methods Xiao Li can use to exchange his crops for product X, and track the remaining units of crops A and B, as well as the total units of product X obtained. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 3 units\n   - Crop B: 3 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle 1: Method 1**\n   - Method 1 requires 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B to exchange for 1 unit of product X.\n   - Execute Method 1:\n     - Crop A: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n     - Crop B: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n     - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n3. **Cycle 1: Method 2**\n   - Method 2 requires 3 units of crop A to exchange for 2 units of product X.\n   - Execute Method 2:\n     - Crop A: 2 - 3 = -1 units (not possible, so Method 2 cannot be executed)\n   - Since Method 2 cannot be executed, we stop the cycle here.\n\n4. **Final State:**\n   - Crop A: 2 units\n   - Crop B: 2 units\n   - Product X: 1 unit\n\nSince no further methods can be executed due to insufficient units of crop A for Method 2, the process ends here.\n\nThe final answer, showing the remaining units of crop A, crop B, and the total units of product X obtained, is:\n\n<<<[2, 2, 1]>>>"
