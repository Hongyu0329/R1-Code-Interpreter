  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 6 units of crop A, 3 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of methods Xiao Li uses to exchange crops for product X and track the remaining units of crops A and B, as well as the total units of product X obtained. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 6 units\n- Crop B: 3 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle 1:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n- Execution: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B are exchanged for 1 unit of product X.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n  - Crop B: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n  - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n- Execution: 3 units of crop A are exchanged for 2 units of product X.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n  - Crop B: 2 units (unchanged)\n  - Product X: 1 + 2 = 3 units\n\n### Cycle 2:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n- Execution: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B are exchanged for 1 unit of product X.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n  - Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n  - Product X: 3 + 1 = 4 units\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n- Execution: Not possible because only 1 unit of crop A is available.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 1 unit (unchanged)\n  - Crop B: 1 unit (unchanged)\n  - Product X: 4 units (unchanged)\n\n### Cycle 3:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n- Execution: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B are exchanged for 1 unit of product X.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n  - Crop B: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n  - Product X: 4 + 1 = 5 units\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n- Execution: Not possible because there are 0 units of crop A.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 0 units (unchanged)\n  - Crop B: 0 units (unchanged)\n  - Product X: 5 units (unchanged)\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter completing the cycles, Xiao Li cannot execute any more methods because there are no units of crop A or crop B left. The final state is:\n\n- Remaining Crop A: 0 units\n- Remaining Crop B: 0 units\n- Total Product X obtained: 5 units\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[0, 0, 5]>>>"
