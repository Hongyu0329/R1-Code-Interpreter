  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 3 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of methods and how they affect the quantities of crops A and B, as well as the product X. We will go through each method step by step, applying them in the given order, and keep track of the remaining units of crops and the obtained units of product X.\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 4 units\n- Crop B: 3 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle 1:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n- Execution: Since we have 4 units of A and 3 units of B, we can execute this method.\n- Result: \n  - Crop A: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n  - Crop B: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n  - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n- Execution: We have 3 units of A, so we can execute this method.\n- Result:\n  - Crop A: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n  - Crop B: 2 units (unchanged)\n  - Product X: 1 + 2 = 3 units\n\n### Cycle 2:\n\n**Method 1:**\n- Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n- Execution: We have 0 units of A and 2 units of B. We cannot execute this method because we do not have enough units of crop A.\n- Result: No change in quantities.\n\n**Method 2:**\n- Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n- Execution: We have 0 units of A. We cannot execute this method because we do not have enough units of crop A.\n- Result: No change in quantities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter completing the cycles, we find that no further methods can be executed due to insufficient units of crop A. Therefore, the final state of the crops and product X is as follows:\n\n- Remaining Crop A: 0 units\n- Remaining Crop B: 2 units\n- Obtained Product X: 3 units\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[0, 2, 3]>>>"
