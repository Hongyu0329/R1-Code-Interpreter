  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 5 units of crop A, 2 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of methods and the available resources at each step. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Initial Resources:\n- Crop A: 5 units\n- Crop B: 2 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Method Execution Cycle:\n1. **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n2. **Method 2**: Exchange 3 units of crop A for 2 units of product X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n1. **Cycle 1:**\n   - **Method 1**: \n     - Use 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B.\n     - Obtain 1 unit of product X.\n     - Remaining resources: \n       - Crop A: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n       - Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n       - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n   - **Method 2**: \n     - Use 3 units of crop A.\n     - Obtain 2 units of product X.\n     - Remaining resources:\n       - Crop A: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n       - Crop B: 1 unit (unchanged)\n       - Product X: 1 + 2 = 3 units\n\n2. **Cycle 2:**\n   - **Method 1**: \n     - Use 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B.\n     - Obtain 1 unit of product X.\n     - Remaining resources:\n       - Crop A: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n       - Crop B: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n       - Product X: 3 + 1 = 4 units\n\n   - **Method 2**: \n     - Cannot execute because there are not enough units of crop A (need 3, have 0).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- After completing the cycles, we cannot execute any more methods because we do not have enough resources.\n- The final remaining resources are:\n  - Crop A: 0 units\n  - Crop B: 0 units\n  - Product X: 4 units\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[0, 0, 4]>>>"
