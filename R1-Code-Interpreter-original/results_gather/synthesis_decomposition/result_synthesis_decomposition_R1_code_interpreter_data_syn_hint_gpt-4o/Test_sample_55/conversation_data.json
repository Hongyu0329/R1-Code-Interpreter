  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 6 units of crop B, 5 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods and apply them as long as they are possible. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 4 units\n   - Crop B: 6 units\n   - Crop C: 5 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle through the methods:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Requires 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n     - Apply Method 1:\n       - A: 4 - 1 = 3\n       - B: 6 - 1 = 5\n       - C: 5 - 1 = 4\n       - X: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n   - **Method 2:** Requires 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to produce 2 units of C.\n     - Apply Method 2:\n       - A: 3 - 1 = 2\n       - B: 5 - 1 = 4\n       - C: 4 + 2 = 6\n       - X: 1 (no change)\n\n   - **Method 3:** Requires 2 units of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n     - Apply Method 3:\n       - A: 2 (no change)\n       - B: 4 (no change)\n       - C: 6 - 2 = 4\n       - X: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. **Repeat the cycle:**\n\n   - **Method 1:**\n     - Apply Method 1:\n       - A: 2 - 1 = 1\n       - B: 4 - 1 = 3\n       - C: 4 - 1 = 3\n       - X: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n   - **Method 2:**\n     - Apply Method 2:\n       - A: 1 - 1 = 0\n       - B: 3 - 1 = 2\n       - C: 3 + 2 = 5\n       - X: 3 (no change)\n\n   - **Method 3:**\n     - Apply Method 3:\n       - A: 0 (no change)\n       - B: 2 (no change)\n       - C: 5 - 2 = 3\n       - X: 3 + 1 = 4\n\n4. **Check if another cycle is possible:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Cannot be applied because A = 0.\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot be applied because A = 0.\n   - **Method 3:** Can be applied because C >= 2.\n\n   - **Method 3:**\n     - Apply Method 3:\n       - A: 0 (no change)\n       - B: 2 (no change)\n       - C: 3 - 2 = 1\n       - X: 4 + 1 = 5\n\n5. **Final State:**\n   - Crop A: 0 units\n   - Crop B: 2 units\n   - Crop C: 1 unit\n   - Product X: 5 units\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached the final state. Let's output the result.\n\n<<<[0, 2, 1, 5]>>>"
