  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 5 units of crop A, 2 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops A and B for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods until no more exchanges can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Crop A: 5 units\n   - Crop B: 2 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle through Methods**:\n   - **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X. This can be done only once per cycle.\n   - **Method 2**: Exchange 3 units of crop A for 2 units of product X. This can be done only once per cycle.\n\n3. **Execution of Methods**:\n   - **First Cycle**:\n     - **Method 1**: \n       - Use 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B.\n       - Remaining A: 4 units\n       - Remaining B: 1 unit\n       - Obtained X: 1 unit\n     - **Method 2**:\n       - Use 3 units of A.\n       - Remaining A: 1 unit\n       - Remaining B: 1 unit\n       - Obtained X: 2 more units (total 3 units)\n\n   - **Second Cycle**:\n     - **Method 1**:\n       - Use 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B.\n       - Remaining A: 0 units\n       - Remaining B: 0 units\n       - Obtained X: 1 more unit (total 4 units)\n     - **Method 2**:\n       - Cannot execute because there are not enough units of A.\n\n4. **Final State**:\n   - Remaining A: 0 units\n   - Remaining B: 0 units\n   - Obtained X: 4 units\n\nNow, let's summarize the final result in the required format.\n\n<<<[0, 0, 4]>>>"
