  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 4 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops A and B for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods until no more exchanges can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 4 units\n   - Crop B: 4 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle through Methods:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n     - After applying Method 1:\n       - Crop A: 3 units\n       - Crop B: 3 units\n       - Product X: 1 unit\n\n   - **Method 2:** Exchange 3 units of crop A for 2 units of product X.\n     - After applying Method 2:\n       - Crop A: 0 units\n       - Crop B: 3 units\n       - Product X: 3 units\n\n3. **Check if another cycle can be executed:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Requires at least 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B. We have 0 units of crop A, so Method 1 cannot be executed.\n   - **Method 2:** Requires at least 3 units of crop A. We have 0 units of crop A, so Method 2 cannot be executed.\n\nSince neither method can be executed again, the cycle stops here.\n\n4. **Final State:**\n   - Crop A: 0 units\n   - Crop B: 3 units\n   - Product X: 3 units\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n<<<[0, 3, 3]>>>"
