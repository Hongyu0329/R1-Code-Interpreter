  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 3 units of crop A, 2 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops A and B for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods until no further exchanges can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 3 units\n   - Crop B: 2 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n   - This can be done only once per cycle.\n   - After applying Method 1:\n     - Crop A: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n     - Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n     - Product X: 0 + 1 = 1 unit\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Exchange 3 units of crop A for 2 units of product X.\n   - This can be done only once per cycle.\n   - After applying Method 2:\n     - Crop A: 2 units (not enough to perform Method 2, as it requires 3 units of crop A)\n     - Crop B: 1 unit\n     - Product X: 1 unit (no change since Method 2 cannot be executed)\n\n4. **Cycle Restart:**\n   - We restart the cycle from Method 1.\n   - Check if Method 1 can be executed:\n     - Crop A: 2 units\n     - Crop B: 1 unit\n     - Method 1 requires 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B, so it can be executed.\n\n5. **Method 1 (Second Cycle):**\n   - Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n   - After applying Method 1 again:\n     - Crop A: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n     - Crop B: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n     - Product X: 1 + 1 = 2 units\n\n6. **Method 2 (Second Cycle):**\n   - Check if Method 2 can be executed:\n     - Crop A: 1 unit (not enough to perform Method 2, as it requires 3 units of crop A)\n     - Crop B: 0 units\n     - Product X: 2 units (no change since Method 2 cannot be executed)\n\n7. **Cycle Restart:**\n   - We restart the cycle from Method 1.\n   - Check if Method 1 can be executed:\n     - Crop A: 1 unit\n     - Crop B: 0 units\n     - Method 1 requires 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B, so it cannot be executed.\n\nSince neither Method 1 nor Method 2 can be executed anymore, the process stops here.\n\nThe final state is:\n- Crop A: 1 unit\n- Crop B: 0 units\n- Product X: 2 units\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[1, 0, 2]>>>"
