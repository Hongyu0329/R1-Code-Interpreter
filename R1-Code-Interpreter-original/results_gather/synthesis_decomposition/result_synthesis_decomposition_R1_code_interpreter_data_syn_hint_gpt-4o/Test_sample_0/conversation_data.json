  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 3 units of crop A, 2 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops A and B for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods until no more exchanges can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 3 units\n   - Crop B: 2 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n   - Exchange: 1 unit of product X\n   - Since we have 3 units of A and 2 units of B, we can apply Method 1.\n   - After applying Method 1:\n     - Crop A: 2 units (3 - 1)\n     - Crop B: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n     - Product X: 1 unit (0 + 1)\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n   - Exchange: 2 units of product X\n   - We have 2 units of A, which is not enough to apply Method 2.\n   - Therefore, Method 2 cannot be applied.\n\n4. **Cycle Restart:**\n   - We restart the cycle with Method 1.\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n   - We have 2 units of A and 1 unit of B, so we can apply Method 1 again.\n   - After applying Method 1:\n     - Crop A: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n     - Crop B: 0 units (1 - 1)\n     - Product X: 2 units (1 + 1)\n\n5. **Method 2:**\n   - Requirement: 3 units of crop A\n   - We have 1 unit of A, which is not enough to apply Method 2.\n   - Therefore, Method 2 cannot be applied.\n\n6. **Cycle Restart:**\n   - We restart the cycle with Method 1.\n   - Requirement: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B\n   - We have 1 unit of A and 0 units of B, which is not enough to apply Method 1.\n   - Therefore, Method 1 cannot be applied.\n\nAt this point, no more exchanges can be made. The final state is:\n\n- Crop A: 1 unit\n- Crop B: 0 units\n- Product X: 2 units\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[1, 0, 2]>>>"
