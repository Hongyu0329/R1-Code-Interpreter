  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 6 units of crop A, 4 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops A and B for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods until no more exchanges can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 6 units\n   - Crop B: 4 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle through Methods:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n     - New state after Method 1:\n       - Crop A: 5 units (6 - 1)\n       - Crop B: 3 units (4 - 1)\n       - Product X: 1 unit (0 + 1)\n\n   - **Method 2:** Exchange 3 units of crop A for 2 units of product X.\n     - New state after Method 2:\n       - Crop A: 2 units (5 - 3)\n       - Crop B: 3 units (unchanged)\n       - Product X: 3 units (1 + 2)\n\n3. **Repeat the Cycle:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n     - New state after Method 1:\n       - Crop A: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n       - Crop B: 2 units (3 - 1)\n       - Product X: 4 units (3 + 1)\n\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot be executed because there are only 1 unit of crop A left, and 3 units are required.\n\n4. **End of Cycle:**\n   - No more methods can be executed because Method 2 cannot be executed due to insufficient crop A, and Method 1 cannot be executed again in this cycle.\n\n5. **Final State:**\n   - Crop A: 1 unit\n   - Crop B: 2 units\n   - Product X: 4 units\n\nNow, let's wrap the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[1, 2, 4]>>>"
