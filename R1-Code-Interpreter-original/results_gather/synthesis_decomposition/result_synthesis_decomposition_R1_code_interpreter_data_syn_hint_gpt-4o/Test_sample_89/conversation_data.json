  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 5 units of crop B, 4 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods and apply them as long as possible. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Crop A: 4 units\n   - Crop B: 5 units\n   - Crop C: 4 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle through Methods**:\n   - **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n   - **Method 2**: Exchange 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B for 2 units of C.\n   - **Method 3**: Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - **Cycle 1**:\n     - **Method 1**: \n       - A = 4 - 1 = 3\n       - B = 5 - 1 = 4\n       - C = 4 - 1 = 3\n       - X = 0 + 1 = 1\n     - **Method 2**:\n       - A = 3 - 1 = 2\n       - B = 4 - 1 = 3\n       - C = 3 + 2 = 5\n     - **Method 3**:\n       - C = 5 - 2 = 3\n       - X = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n   - **Cycle 2**:\n     - **Method 1**:\n       - A = 2 - 1 = 1\n       - B = 3 - 1 = 2\n       - C = 3 - 1 = 2\n       - X = 2 + 1 = 3\n     - **Method 2**:\n       - A = 1 - 1 = 0\n       - B = 2 - 1 = 1\n       - C = 2 + 2 = 4\n     - **Method 3**:\n       - C = 4 - 2 = 2\n       - X = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n   - **Cycle 3**:\n     - **Method 1**: Cannot be executed because A = 0.\n     - **Method 2**: Cannot be executed because A = 0.\n     - **Method 3**:\n       - C = 2 - 2 = 0\n       - X = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. **Final State**:\n   - Crop A: 0 units\n   - Crop B: 1 unit\n   - Crop C: 0 units\n   - Product X: 5 units\n\nNow, let's wrap the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[0, 1, 0, 5]>>>"
