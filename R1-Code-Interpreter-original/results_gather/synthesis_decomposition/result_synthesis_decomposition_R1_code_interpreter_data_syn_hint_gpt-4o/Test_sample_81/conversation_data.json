  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 5 units of crop A, 6 units of crop B, 3 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods and apply them as long as they are possible. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 5 units\n   - Crop B: 6 units\n   - Crop C: 3 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Requires 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 1:\n     - New state: A = 4, B = 5, C = 2, X = 1\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Requires 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to produce 2 units of C.\n   - Apply Method 2:\n     - New state: A = 3, B = 4, C = 4, X = 1\n\n4. **Method 3:**\n   - Requires 2 units of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 3:\n     - New state: A = 3, B = 4, C = 2, X = 2\n\n5. **Cycle Repeats:**\n\n   - **Method 1:**\n     - Apply Method 1:\n       - New state: A = 2, B = 3, C = 1, X = 3\n\n   - **Method 2:**\n     - Apply Method 2:\n       - New state: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, X = 3\n\n   - **Method 3:**\n     - Apply Method 3:\n       - New state: A = 1, B = 2, C = 1, X = 4\n\n6. **Cycle Repeats Again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:**\n     - Cannot apply Method 1 because C < 1.\n\n   - **Method 2:**\n     - Apply Method 2:\n       - New state: A = 0, B = 1, C = 3, X = 4\n\n   - **Method 3:**\n     - Apply Method 3:\n       - New state: A = 0, B = 1, C = 1, X = 5\n\n7. **Cycle Repeats Again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:**\n     - Cannot apply Method 1 because A < 1.\n\n   - **Method 2:**\n     - Cannot apply Method 2 because A < 1.\n\n   - **Method 3:**\n     - Cannot apply Method 3 because C < 2.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be applied. The final state is:\n\n- Crop A: 0 units\n- Crop B: 1 unit\n- Crop C: 1 unit\n- Product X: 5 units\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[0, 1, 1, 5]>>>"
