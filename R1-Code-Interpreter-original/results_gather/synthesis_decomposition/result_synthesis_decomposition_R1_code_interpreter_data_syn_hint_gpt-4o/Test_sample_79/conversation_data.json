  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 4 units of crop B, 4 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods and apply them as long as they are possible. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Crop A: 4 units\n   - Crop B: 4 units\n   - Crop C: 4 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle through the methods**:\n   - **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n     - New state: A = 3, B = 3, C = 3, X = 1\n   - **Method 2**: Exchange 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B for 2 units of C.\n     - New state: A = 2, B = 2, C = 5, X = 1\n   - **Method 3**: Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n     - New state: A = 2, B = 2, C = 3, X = 2\n\n3. **Repeat the cycle**:\n   - **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C for 1 unit of X.\n     - New state: A = 1, B = 1, C = 2, X = 3\n   - **Method 2**: Exchange 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B for 2 units of C.\n     - New state: A = 0, B = 0, C = 4, X = 3\n   - **Method 3**: Exchange 2 units of C for 1 unit of X.\n     - New state: A = 0, B = 0, C = 2, X = 4\n\n4. **Attempt another cycle**:\n   - **Method 1**: Cannot be executed because there are no units of A or B.\n   - **Method 2**: Cannot be executed because there are no units of A or B.\n   - **Method 3**: Can be executed because there are 2 units of C.\n     - New state: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0, X = 5\n\n5. **Final state**:\n   - Crop A: 0 units\n   - Crop B: 0 units\n   - Crop C: 0 units\n   - Product X: 5 units\n\nNow, let's wrap the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[0, 0, 0, 5]>>>"
