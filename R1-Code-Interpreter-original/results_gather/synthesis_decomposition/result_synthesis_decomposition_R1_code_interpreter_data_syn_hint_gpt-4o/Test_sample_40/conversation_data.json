  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 7 units of crop A, 3 units of crop B, 3 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods and apply them as long as they are possible. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 7 units\n   - Crop B: 3 units\n   - Crop C: 3 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Requires 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 1:\n     - New Crop A: 7 - 1 = 6\n     - New Crop B: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - New Crop C: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - New Product X: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Requires 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to produce 2 units of C.\n   - Apply Method 2:\n     - New Crop A: 6 - 1 = 5\n     - New Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - New Crop C: 2 + 2 = 4\n     - Product X remains 1\n\n4. **Method 3:**\n   - Requires 2 units of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 3:\n     - New Crop C: 4 - 2 = 2\n     - New Product X: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. **Cycle Repeats:**\n\n   - **Method 1:**\n     - Apply Method 1:\n       - New Crop A: 5 - 1 = 4\n       - New Crop B: 1 - 1 = 0\n       - New Crop C: 2 - 1 = 1\n       - New Product X: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n   - **Method 2:**\n     - Cannot apply Method 2 because Crop B is 0.\n\n   - **Method 3:**\n     - Cannot apply Method 3 because Crop C is 1, which is less than 2.\n\n6. **Final State:**\n   - Crop A: 4 units\n   - Crop B: 0 units\n   - Crop C: 1 unit\n   - Product X: 3 units\n\nNow, let's wrap the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[4, 0, 1, 3]>>>"
