  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 6 units of crop A, 6 units of crop B, 3 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the cycle of methods that Xiao Li uses to exchange his crops for product X. We will follow the sequence of methods and apply them as long as they are possible. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Crop A: 6 units\n   - Crop B: 6 units\n   - Crop C: 3 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Requires 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 1:\n     - New Crop A: 6 - 1 = 5\n     - New Crop B: 6 - 1 = 5\n     - New Crop C: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - New Product X: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Requires 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to produce 2 units of C.\n   - Apply Method 2:\n     - New Crop A: 5 - 1 = 4\n     - New Crop B: 5 - 1 = 4\n     - New Crop C: 2 + 2 = 4\n     - Product X remains 1\n\n4. **Method 3:**\n   - Requires 2 units of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 3:\n     - New Crop C: 4 - 2 = 2\n     - New Product X: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. **Cycle Repeats:**\n\n   - **Method 1:**\n     - New Crop A: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - New Crop B: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - New Crop C: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - New Product X: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n   - **Method 2:**\n     - New Crop A: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - New Crop B: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - New Crop C: 1 + 2 = 3\n     - Product X remains 3\n\n   - **Method 3:**\n     - New Crop C: 3 - 2 = 1\n     - New Product X: 3 + 1 = 4\n\n6. **Cycle Repeats Again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:**\n     - New Crop A: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - New Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - New Crop C: 1 - 1 = 0\n     - New Product X: 4 + 1 = 5\n\n   - **Method 2:**\n     - New Crop A: 1 - 1 = 0\n     - New Crop B: 1 - 1 = 0\n     - New Crop C: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Product X remains 5\n\n   - **Method 3:**\n     - New Crop C: 2 - 2 = 0\n     - New Product X: 5 + 1 = 6\n\n7. **No More Methods Can Be Applied:**\n   - Crop A: 0 units\n   - Crop B: 0 units\n   - Crop C: 0 units\n   - Product X: 6 units\n\nThe cycle cannot continue as there are no sufficient crops to apply any method. Therefore, the final state is:\n\n<<<[0, 0, 0, 6]>>>"
