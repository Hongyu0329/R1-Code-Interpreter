  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A and B. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 3 units of crop A can be exchanged for 2 units of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 2, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 3 units of crop A, 3 units of crop B.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops A and B for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods until no more exchanges can be made. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Crop A: 3 units\n   - Crop B: 3 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Cycle through Methods**:\n   - **Method 1**: Exchange 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B for 1 unit of product X.\n     - After applying Method 1:\n       - Crop A: 2 units\n       - Crop B: 2 units\n       - Product X: 1 unit\n\n   - **Method 2**: Exchange 3 units of crop A for 2 units of product X.\n     - After applying Method 2:\n       - Crop A: 2 units (not enough to apply Method 2)\n       - Crop B: 2 units\n       - Product X: 1 unit (no change since Method 2 cannot be applied)\n\n3. **Repeat the Cycle**:\n   - **Method 1**: Can be applied again.\n     - After applying Method 1:\n       - Crop A: 1 unit\n       - Crop B: 1 unit\n       - Product X: 2 units\n\n   - **Method 2**: Cannot be applied because there are not enough units of crop A.\n\n4. **Final State**:\n   - Crop A: 1 unit\n   - Crop B: 1 unit\n   - Product X: 2 units\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, we have reached the final state. Let's summarize the results:\n\n- Remaining Crop A: 1 unit\n- Remaining Crop B: 1 unit\n- Obtained Product X: 2 units\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[1, 1, 2]>>>"
