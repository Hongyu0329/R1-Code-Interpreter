  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 4 units of crop A, 5 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging crops for product X using the given methods. We will follow the cycle of methods and apply them as long as they are applicable. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Crop A: 4 units\n   - Crop B: 5 units\n   - Crop C: 2 units\n   - Product X: 0 units\n\n2. **Method 1**: \n   - Requires 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 1:\n     - New Crop A: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - New Crop B: 5 - 1 = 4\n     - New Crop C: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - New Product X: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3. **Method 2**: \n   - Requires 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to produce 2 units of C.\n   - Apply Method 2:\n     - New Crop A: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - New Crop B: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - New Crop C: 1 + 2 = 3\n     - Product X remains 1\n\n4. **Method 3**: \n   - Requires 2 units of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 3:\n     - New Crop C: 3 - 2 = 1\n     - New Product X: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. **Cycle Repeats**: \n   - Start again from Method 1.\n\n6. **Method 1**: \n   - Requires 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 1:\n     - New Crop A: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - New Crop B: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - New Crop C: 1 - 1 = 0\n     - New Product X: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n7. **Method 2**: \n   - Requires 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to produce 2 units of C.\n   - Apply Method 2:\n     - New Crop A: 1 - 1 = 0\n     - New Crop B: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - New Crop C: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Product X remains 3\n\n8. **Method 3**: \n   - Requires 2 units of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n   - Apply Method 3:\n     - New Crop C: 2 - 2 = 0\n     - New Product X: 3 + 1 = 4\n\n9. **Cycle Repeats**: \n   - Start again from Method 1.\n\n10. **Method 1**: \n    - Requires 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n    - Cannot apply Method 1 because Crop C is 0.\n\n11. **Method 2**: \n    - Requires 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to produce 2 units of C.\n    - Cannot apply Method 2 because Crop A is 0.\n\n12. **Method 3**: \n    - Requires 2 units of C to produce 1 unit of X.\n    - Cannot apply Method 3 because Crop C is 0.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, the process stops here. Let's summarize the final state:\n\n- Remaining Crop A: 0\n- Remaining Crop B: 1\n- Remaining Crop C: 0\n- Obtained Product X: 4\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[0, 1, 0, 4]>>>"
