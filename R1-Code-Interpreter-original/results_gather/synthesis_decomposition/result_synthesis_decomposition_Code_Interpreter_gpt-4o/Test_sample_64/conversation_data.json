  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 7 units of crop A, 4 units of crop B, 5 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

Therefore, the final result is:\n\n<<<[3, 0, 1, 5]>>>"
