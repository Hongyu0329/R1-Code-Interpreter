  "question": "Xiao Li is a farm owner who grows A, B, and C. He can exchange these crops for agricultural product X. He has discovered the following methods to increase the farm's yield:\n\nMethod 1: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B and 1 unit of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 2: 1 unit of crop A and 1 unit of crop B can be exchanged for 2 units of product C, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nMethod 3: 2 units of crop C can be exchanged for 1 unit of product X, and this can be done only once per cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 3, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed.\n\nInitially there are 7 units of crop A, 6 units of crop B, 4 units of crop C.\n\nFirst output the entire reasoning process step by step, showing each synthesis step's result. Then wrap your final answer in <<<>>> format as a list showing [remaining_A, remaining_B, remaining_C, obtained_X]. For example, if there are 1 unit of crop A, 0 units of crop B, 2 units of crop C, and 3 units of product X remaining, output: <<<[1, 0, 2, 3]>>>",

    "\nassistant > Let's go through the process step by step, applying each method in the given order until no method can be executed:\n\n### Initial State:\n- Crop A: 7 units\n- Crop B: 6 units\n- Crop C: 4 units\n- Product X: 0 units\n\n### Cycle 1:\n\n#### Method 1:\n- Use 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to get 1 unit of X.\n- Remaining: A = 6, B = 5, C = 3, X = 1\n\n#### Method 2:\n- Use 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to get 2 units of C.\n- Remaining: A = 5, B = 4, C = 5, X = 1\n\n#### Method 3:\n- Use 2 units of C to get 1 unit of X.\n- Remaining: A = 5, B = 4, C = 3, X = 2\n\n### Cycle 2:\n\n#### Method 1:\n- Use 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to get 1 unit of X.\n- Remaining: A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, X = 3\n\n#### Method 2:\n- Use 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to get 2 units of C.\n- Remaining: A = 3, B = 2, C = 4, X = 3\n\n#### Method 3:\n- Use 2 units of C to get 1 unit of X.\n- Remaining: A = 3, B = 2, C = 2, X = 4\n\n### Cycle 3:\n\n#### Method 1:\n- Use 1 unit of A, 1 unit of B, and 1 unit of C to get 1 unit of X.\n- Remaining: A = 2, B = 1, C = 1, X = 5\n\n#### Method 2:\n- Use 1 unit of A and 1 unit of B to get 2 units of C.\n- Remaining: A = 1, B = 0, C = 3, X = 5\n\n#### Method 3:\n- Use 2 units of C to get 1 unit of X.\n- Remaining: A = 1, B = 0, C = 1, X = 6\n\n### Cycle 4:\n\n#### Method 1:\n- Cannot execute because there is not enough B (0 units).\n\n#### Method 2:\n- Cannot execute because there is not enough B (0 units).\n\n#### Method 3:\n- Cannot execute because there is not enough C (only 1 unit).\n\nNo more methods can be executed.\n\n### Final State:\n- Crop A: 1 unit\n- Crop B: 0 units\n- Crop C: 1 unit\n- Product X: 6 units\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[1, 0, 1, 6]>>>"
