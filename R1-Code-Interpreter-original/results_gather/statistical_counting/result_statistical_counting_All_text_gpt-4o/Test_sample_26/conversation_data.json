    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"EFEAFEEAECECFEDDFFABBDCBB\" and calculate the total score based on the rules provided. Let's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of each letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **E**: \n     - At index 0, we have 'E'. \n     - At index 4, we have 'E', and at index 5, another 'E'. This is a consecutive pair, so add 5 to the score. Total score = 5.\n     - At index 7, we have 'E'. \n     - At index 9, we have 'E'. \n     - At index 11, we have 'E'. \n   - **F**: \n     - At index 1, we have 'F'. \n     - At index 10, we have 'F'. \n     - At index 12, we have 'F'. \n     - At index 14, we have 'F', and at index 15, another 'F'. This is a consecutive pair, so add 6 to the score. Total score = 11.\n   - **A**: \n     - At index 2, we have 'A'. \n     - At index 6, we have 'A'. \n   - **C**: \n     - At index 8, we have 'C'. \n     - At index 13, we have 'C'. \n   - **D**: \n     - At index 3, we have 'D'. \n     - At index 16, we have 'D', and at index 17, another 'D'. This is a consecutive pair, so add 4 to the score. Total score = 15.\n   - **B**: \n     - At index 18, we have 'B'. \n     - At index 19, we have 'B'. This is a consecutive pair, so add 2 to the score. Total score = 17.\n     - At index 21, we have 'B', and at index 22, another 'B'. This is a consecutive pair, so add 2 to the score. Total score = 19.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 19.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<19>>>."
