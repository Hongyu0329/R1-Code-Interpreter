    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"AA\", we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"BB\", we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"CC\", we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Move through the string, applying the above rules wherever applicable.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, \"CCC\" should be counted as one occurrence of consecutive 'C's, not two.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- The string is: \"ACBABCCCBABCBCCAAABBCCCABBCCABABABAABCBCCBBCCCBBCBBCCCB\".\n\n- **Step-by-step analysis**:\n  - \"ACB\" - No consecutive letters.\n  - \"ABCC\" - \"CC\" adds 3 to the score.\n  - \"CCB\" - \"CC\" adds 3 to the score.\n  - \"ABCB\" - No consecutive letters.\n  - \"CCAA\" - \"CC\" adds 3 to the score, \"AA\" adds 1 to the score.\n  - \"ABB\" - \"BB\" adds 2 to the score.\n  - \"CCC\" - \"CCC\" adds 3 to the score.\n  - \"ABB\" - \"BB\" adds 2 to the score.\n  - \"CC\" - \"CC\" adds 3 to the score.\n  - \"ABABABA\" - No consecutive letters.\n  - \"ABCB\" - No consecutive letters.\n  - \"CCBB\" - \"CC\" adds 3 to the score, \"BB\" adds 2 to the score.\n  - \"CCCB\" - \"CCC\" adds 3 to the score.\n  - \"BCBB\" - \"BB\" adds 2 to the score.\n  - \"CCCB\" - \"CCC\" adds 3 to the score.\n\n- **Total score calculation**:\n  - 3 (from \"CC\") + 3 (from \"CC\") + 3 (from \"CC\") + 1 (from \"AA\") + 2 (from \"BB\") + 3 (from \"CCC\") + 2 (from \"BB\") + 3 (from \"CC\") + 3 (from \"CC\") + 2 (from \"BB\") + 3 (from \"CCC\") + 2 (from \"BB\") + 3 (from \"CCC\") = 36.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 36.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<36>>>."
