    "To determine the total score of the given string \"ABBAABCCBACAAACBBAACCABABCCABABBCAACCACABBAAA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **Consecutive A's**: Add 1 to the score for each occurrence of two or more consecutive 'A's.\n   - **Consecutive B's**: Add 2 to the score for each occurrence of two or more consecutive 'B's.\n   - **Consecutive C's**: Add 3 to the score for each occurrence of two or more consecutive 'C's.\n\n4. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n   - **ABBAA**: \n     - 'BB' is found, add 2 to the score (score = 2).\n     - 'AA' is found, add 1 to the score (score = 3).\n   - **BCCB**: \n     - 'CC' is found, add 3 to the score (score = 6).\n   - **ACAAA**: \n     - 'AAA' is found, add 1 to the score (score = 7).\n   - **CBBAA**: \n     - 'BB' is found, add 2 to the score (score = 9).\n     - 'AA' is found, add 1 to the score (score = 10).\n   - **CCAB**: \n     - 'CC' is found, add 3 to the score (score = 13).\n   - **ABABCC**: \n     - 'CC' is found, add 3 to the score (score = 16).\n   - **ABABB**: \n     - 'BB' is found, add 2 to the score (score = 18).\n   - **CAACC**: \n     - 'AA' is found, add 1 to the score (score = 19).\n     - 'CC' is found, add 3 to the score (score = 22).\n   - **ACABBAAA**: \n     - 'BB' is found, add 2 to the score (score = 24).\n     - 'AAA' is found, add 1 to the score (score = 25).\n\n5. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string and applying the rules, the total score is calculated.\n\nThe total score of the string is <<<25>>>."
