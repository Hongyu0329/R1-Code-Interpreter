    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string and apply the scoring rules step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Total Score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will iterate through the string and look for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Apply Scoring Rules**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n4. **Avoid Double Counting**: Ensure that each sequence of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, if there are three consecutive 'B's, we should only add 2 to the score once for that sequence.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the String**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive sequences and updating the score accordingly.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **BCCCCBAACCAACCBBBAACABACBBBBAACBAACACCCBBBABBACBAACACCA**\n\n1. **BCCCC**: \n   - 'CCCC' is a sequence of 4 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n\n2. **BAACCAACC**:\n   - 'AA' is a sequence of 2 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 4.\n   - 'CC' is a sequence of 2 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 7.\n   - 'AA' is another sequence of 2 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - 'CC' is another sequence of 2 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 11.\n\n3. **BBBAACABACBBBBAACBAACACCCBBBABBACBAACACCA**:\n   - 'BBB' is a sequence of 3 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 13.\n   - 'AA' is a sequence of 2 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 14.\n   - 'BBB' is another sequence of 3 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 16.\n   - 'AA' is another sequence of 2 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 17.\n   - 'CCC' is a sequence of 3 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 20.\n   - 'BBB' is another sequence of 3 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 22.\n   - 'AA' is another sequence of 2 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 23.\n   - 'CC' is another sequence of 2 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 26.\n\nAfter analyzing the entire string, the final total score is 26.\n\nThe answer is: <<<26>>>"
