    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"CBABBECAECEEBBCEECBB\" and calculate the total score based on the rules provided. Let's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**: \n   - There are no consecutive A's in the string.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**: \n   - At positions 3 and 4, we have \"BB\". Add 2 to the total score (total score = 2).\n   - At positions 13 and 14, we have \"BB\". Add 2 to the total score (total score = 4).\n   - At positions 18 and 19, we have \"BB\". Add 2 to the total score (total score = 6).\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**: \n   - At positions 15 and 16, we have \"CC\". Add 3 to the total score (total score = 9).\n\n6. **Check for consecutive D's**: \n   - There are no consecutive D's in the string.\n\n7. **Check for consecutive E's**: \n   - At positions 9 and 10, we have \"EE\". Add 5 to the total score (total score = 14).\n   - At positions 16 and 17, we have \"EE\". Add 5 to the total score (total score = 19).\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is calculated to be 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
