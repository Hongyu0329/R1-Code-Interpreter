    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"CDAAECBAADBDBAEFDACDCDCBD\" and calculate the total score based on the rules provided. Let's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of the same letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's at the start.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's at the start.\n   - **A**: There are two consecutive A's at positions 3 and 4. Add 1 to the total score. Total score = 1.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's.\n   - **A**: There are two consecutive A's at positions 9 and 10. Add 1 to the total score. Total score = 2.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 2.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"CDAAECBAADBDBAEFDACDCDCBD\" is <<<2>>>."
