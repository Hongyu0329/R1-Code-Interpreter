    "To determine the total score of the string \"CCABCAABCABCBACAABBACCCABCBCBBCBCCC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to scan the string and identify sequences of consecutive 'A's, 'B's, and 'C's.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules:**\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score.\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start scanning the string from the beginning:\n     - \"CC\" (at the start): Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n     - \"A\": Single 'A', no score added.\n     - \"B\": Single 'B', no score added.\n     - \"C\": Single 'C', no score added.\n     - \"AA\": Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 4.\n     - \"B\": Single 'B', no score added.\n     - \"C\": Single 'C', no score added.\n     - \"A\": Single 'A', no score added.\n     - \"B\": Single 'B', no score added.\n     - \"C\": Single 'C', no score added.\n     - \"B\": Single 'B', no score added.\n     - \"A\": Single 'A', no score added.\n     - \"C\": Single 'C', no score added.\n     - \"AA\": Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 5.\n     - \"BB\": Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 7.\n     - \"A\": Single 'A', no score added.\n     - \"C\": Single 'C', no score added.\n     - \"CC\": Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 10.\n     - \"A\": Single 'A', no score added.\n     - \"B\": Single 'B', no score added.\n     - \"C\": Single 'C', no score added.\n     - \"B\": Single 'B', no score added.\n     - \"C\": Single 'C', no score added.\n     - \"BB\": Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 12.\n     - \"C\": Single 'C', no score added.\n     - \"B\": Single 'B', no score added.\n     - \"CCC\": Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 15.\n\n4. **Final Score:**\n   - After scanning the entire string, the total score is 15.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<15>>>."
