    "To determine the total score of the string \"ACFAECADEABCAECEACFAACFDE\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **A**: Look for two or more consecutive 'A's. \n     - In the string, we have \"AA\" at positions 18-19. Add 1 to the score.\n   - **B**: Look for two or more consecutive 'B's.\n     - There are no consecutive 'B's in the string.\n   - **C**: Look for two or more consecutive 'C's.\n     - There are no consecutive 'C's in the string.\n   - **D**: Look for two or more consecutive 'D's.\n     - There are no consecutive 'D's in the string.\n   - **E**: Look for two or more consecutive 'E's.\n     - There are no consecutive 'E's in the string.\n   - **F**: Look for two or more consecutive 'F's.\n     - There are no consecutive 'F's in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**: \n   - From the analysis, we only found one instance of consecutive 'A's, which adds 1 to the score.\n\n5. **Final score**: The total score is 1.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<1>>>."
