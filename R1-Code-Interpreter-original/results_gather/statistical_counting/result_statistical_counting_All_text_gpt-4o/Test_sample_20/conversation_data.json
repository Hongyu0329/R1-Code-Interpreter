    "To determine the total score of the string \"CFEAFECFAFEFECCFEBCCBAABC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of each letter and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **C**: \n     - At positions 0 and 1, there is no consecutive C.\n     - At positions 12 and 13, there are two consecutive C's. Add 3 to the score (total score = 3).\n     - At positions 18 and 19, there are two consecutive C's. Add 3 to the score (total score = 6).\n     - At positions 21 and 22, there are two consecutive C's. Add 3 to the score (total score = 9).\n   - **F**: \n     - At positions 1 and 2, there is no consecutive F.\n     - At positions 6 and 7, there is no consecutive F.\n     - At positions 9 and 10, there is no consecutive F.\n     - At positions 14 and 15, there is no consecutive F.\n     - At positions 16 and 17, there is no consecutive F.\n   - **E**: \n     - At positions 2 and 3, there is no consecutive E.\n     - At positions 5 and 6, there is no consecutive E.\n     - At positions 8 and 9, there is no consecutive E.\n     - At positions 10 and 11, there is no consecutive E.\n     - At positions 13 and 14, there is no consecutive E.\n     - At positions 15 and 16, there is no consecutive E.\n   - **A**: \n     - At positions 3 and 4, there is no consecutive A.\n     - At positions 20 and 21, there is no consecutive A.\n     - At positions 23 and 24, there are two consecutive A's. Add 1 to the score (total score = 10).\n   - **B**: \n     - At positions 4 and 5, there is no consecutive B.\n     - At positions 22 and 23, there is no consecutive B.\n   - **D**: \n     - There are no D's in the string.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string and applying the rules, the total score is 10.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<10>>>."
