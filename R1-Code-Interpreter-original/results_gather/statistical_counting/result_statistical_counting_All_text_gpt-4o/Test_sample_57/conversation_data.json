    "To determine the total score of the string \"CCCACCAAACCABBCAABCBBBCCBCCCBAAABAB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to find sequences of two or more consecutive 'A's, 'B's, or 'C's.\n\n2. **Calculate Score for Each Sequence:**\n   - For each sequence of consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - For each sequence of consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score.\n   - For each sequence of consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score.\n\n3. **Scan the String:**\n   - Start from the beginning of the string and move to the end, checking for consecutive characters.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n   - **A**: Single 'A', no score added.\n   - **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 6.\n   - **AAA**: Three consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 7.\n   - **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 10.\n   - **ABB**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 12.\n   - **CA**: No consecutive characters, no score added.\n   - **ABC**: No consecutive characters, no score added.\n   - **BBB**: Three consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 14.\n   - **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 17.\n   - **B**: Single 'B', no score added.\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 20.\n   - **B**: Single 'B', no score added.\n   - **AAA**: Three consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 21.\n   - **B**: Single 'B', no score added.\n   - **AB**: No consecutive characters, no score added.\n\n5. **Final Score:**\n   - After scanning the entire string, the total score is 21.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<21>>>."
