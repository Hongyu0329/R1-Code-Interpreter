    "To determine the total score of the string \"BACBABBAABCCAABACAACCABCBCCBAAABABC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - We need to ensure that we only count each sequence of consecutive 'A's once.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - Similar to 'A's, each sequence of consecutive 'B's should be counted once.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - Again, each sequence of consecutive 'C's should be counted once.\n\nNow, let's analyze the string:\n\n- **BACBABBAABCCAABACAACCABCBCCBAAABABC**:\n\n  - **BACB**: No consecutive letters.\n  - **ABBA**: Two consecutive 'B's (BB), add 2 to the score. Total score = 2.\n  - **AAB**: Two consecutive 'A's (AA), add 1 to the score. Total score = 3.\n  - **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's (CC), add 3 to the score. Total score = 6.\n  - **AAB**: Two consecutive 'A's (AA), add 1 to the score. Total score = 7.\n  - **ACA**: No consecutive letters.\n  - **ACC**: Two consecutive 'C's (CC), add 3 to the score. Total score = 10.\n  - **ABC**: No consecutive letters.\n  - **BCC**: Two consecutive 'C's (CC), add 3 to the score. Total score = 13.\n  - **BAAA**: Three consecutive 'A's (AAA), add 1 to the score. Total score = 14.\n  - **BABC**: No consecutive letters.\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is 14.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
