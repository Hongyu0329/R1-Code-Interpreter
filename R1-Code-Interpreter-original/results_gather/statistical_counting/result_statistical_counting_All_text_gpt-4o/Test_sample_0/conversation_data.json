If there are two or more consecutive B's, add 2 to the total score.\n\nWhat is the total score of the string BBAAB?\nReturn your answer with the format <<<number>>>, like <<<5>>> means the total score is 5.",

    "To determine the total score of the string \"BBAAB\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Start with a total score of 0.\n   - The string to analyze is \"BBAAB\".\n\n2. **Scan the String**:\n   - We will scan the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **First Pair of Consecutive Letters**:\n   - The string starts with \"BB\". \n   - Since there are two consecutive 'B's, according to rule 2, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - Total score is now 0 + 2 = 2.\n\n4. **Next Characters**:\n   - After \"BB\", the next character is 'A', breaking the sequence of 'B's.\n   - We move to the next part of the string.\n\n5. **Second Pair of Consecutive Letters**:\n   - The next part of the string is \"AA\".\n   - Since there are two consecutive 'A's, according to rule 1, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - Total score is now 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n6. **Final Character**:\n   - The last character is 'B', which does not form a consecutive pair with the previous 'A'.\n   - No additional points are added.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - We have scanned the entire string and applied the rules for consecutive letters.\n   - The final total score is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"BBAAB\" is <<<3>>>."
