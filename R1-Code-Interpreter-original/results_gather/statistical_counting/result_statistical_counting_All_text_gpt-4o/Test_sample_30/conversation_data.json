    "To determine the total score of the string \"CCEEDBCCABECFCABEBBCAECFC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of each letter and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **C**: The string starts with \"CC\", which are two consecutive C's. According to the rule, add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n   - **E**: Next, we have \"EE\", which are two consecutive E's. Add 5 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - **D**: There is no consecutive D, so no score is added.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's here.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's here.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's here.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's here.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's here.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's here.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's here.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's here.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's here.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's here.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's here.\n   - **B**: \"BB\" are two consecutive B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 10.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's here.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's here.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's here.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's here.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's here.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's here.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 10.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<10>>>."
