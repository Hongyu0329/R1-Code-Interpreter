    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BAAAACABCCACCCABABCBACCCBACCCCBACCCABBACBAABB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score** to 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string** from front to back, checking for consecutive letters:\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n   - Start with the first character and move through the string.\n   - Identify sequences of consecutive 'A's, 'B's, or 'C's.\n   - For each sequence, add the appropriate score to the total.\n\n4. **Detailed breakdown**:\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's at the start.\n   - **AAAA**: Four consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score (total score = 1).\n   - **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 4).\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 7).\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 10).\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 13).\n   - **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 16).\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **B**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 18).\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n   - **A**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score (total score = 19).\n   - **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n   - **B**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 21).\n\n5. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 21.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<21>>>."
