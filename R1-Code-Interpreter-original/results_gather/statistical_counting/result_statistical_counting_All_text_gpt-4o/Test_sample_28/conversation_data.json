    "To determine the total score of the string \"BBEDEEEBBBDFDBAAECCDFEFFB\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Total Score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will scan the string from left to right, looking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Identify Consecutive Letters**:\n   - **BB**: The first two letters are \"BB\", which are consecutive B's. According to the rule, add 2 to the total score. Total score = 0 + 2 = 2.\n   - **E**: The next letter is \"E\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **D**: The next letter is \"D\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **EEE**: The next three letters are \"EEE\", which are consecutive E's. According to the rule, add 5 to the total score. Total score = 2 + 5 = 7.\n   - **BBB**: The next three letters are \"BBB\", which are consecutive B's. According to the rule, add 2 to the total score. Total score = 7 + 2 = 9.\n   - **D**: The next letter is \"D\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **F**: The next letter is \"F\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **D**: The next letter is \"D\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **B**: The next letter is \"B\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **AA**: The next two letters are \"AA\", which are consecutive A's. According to the rule, add 1 to the total score. Total score = 9 + 1 = 10.\n   - **E**: The next letter is \"E\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **CC**: The next two letters are \"CC\", which are consecutive C's. According to the rule, add 3 to the total score. Total score = 10 + 3 = 13.\n   - **D**: The next letter is \"D\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **F**: The next letter is \"F\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **E**: The next letter is \"E\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n   - **FF**: The next two letters are \"FF\", which are consecutive F's. According to the rule, add 6 to the total score. Total score = 13 + 6 = 19.\n   - **B**: The last letter is \"B\", which is not consecutive, so no points are added.\n\n4. **Final Total Score**: After scanning the entire string, the final total score is 19.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"BBEDEEEBBBDFDBAAECCDFEFFB\" is <<<19>>>."
