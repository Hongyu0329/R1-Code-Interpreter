    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"DEEBCDDBCDCDBAEAFDAEAADFD\" and calculate the total score based on the rules provided. Let's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of each letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **D**: \n     - At index 0, we have 'D'. \n     - At index 5, we have 'DD'. This is a consecutive pair, so we add 4 to the score. Total score = 4.\n     - At index 21, we have 'DD'. This is another consecutive pair, so we add 4 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - **E**: \n     - At index 1, we have 'EE'. This is a consecutive pair, so we add 5 to the score. Total score = 13.\n   - **B**: \n     - At index 3, we have 'B'. No consecutive B's found.\n   - **C**: \n     - At index 4, we have 'C'. No consecutive C's found.\n   - **A**: \n     - At index 19, we have 'AA'. This is a consecutive pair, so we add 1 to the score. Total score = 14.\n   - **F**: \n     - At index 15, we have 'F'. No consecutive F's found.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 14.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"DEEBCDDBCDCDBAEAFDAEAADFD\" is <<<14>>>."
