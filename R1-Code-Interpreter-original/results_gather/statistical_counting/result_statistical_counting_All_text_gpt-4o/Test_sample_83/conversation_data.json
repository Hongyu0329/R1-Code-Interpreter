    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"AAAA\", there are consecutive 'A's, so we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"BB\", there are consecutive 'B's, so we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"CC\", there are consecutive 'C's, so we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Move through the string, applying the above rules wherever applicable.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, in \"AAA\", we only add 1 to the score, not 2.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- \"AAAABACBABBCCABCBABABBACAABBACCCBCBAAACACBCBCACCAACBAAB\"\n\n1. \"AAAA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 1)\n2. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 3)\n3. \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 6)\n4. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 8)\n5. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 10)\n6. \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 13)\n7. \"CCC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 16)\n8. \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 17)\n9. \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 18)\n10. \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 21)\n11. \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 22)\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the final total score is 22.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<22>>>."
