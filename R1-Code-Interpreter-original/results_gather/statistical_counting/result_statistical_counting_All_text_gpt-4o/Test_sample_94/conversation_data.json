    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n6. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each sequence of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, if there are three consecutive 'A's, it should only contribute 1 to the score, not 2.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the string \"ABCCAABCCBCBBACBCACABCCCBAABABCCACCCCAABBAACABCBAAABABC\":\n\n- **ABCC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 3.\n- **CCAAB**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1. Total score = 4.\n- **ABCC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 7.\n- **CCBCBB**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 9.\n- **BBAC**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 11.\n- **CACABCCC**: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 14.\n- **CBAAB**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1. Total score = 15.\n- **ABABCC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 18.\n- **ACCCCA**: Four consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 21.\n- **AABBAA**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1. Total score = 22.\n- **BBAAC**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 24.\n- **ACABCBAA**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1. Total score = 25.\n- **AABABC**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1. Total score = 26.\n\nAfter analyzing the entire string, the final total score is 26.\n\nThe answer is: <<<26>>>"
