    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n4. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - Start from the first character and move to the next, comparing each character with the previous one.\n   - If a consecutive sequence is found, add the respective score and move the index to the end of that sequence to avoid double counting.\n\n5. **Continue until the end of the string**: Repeat the process until the entire string is scanned.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given string: \"CBCABCCBCCCBCBBBACCBBCBCBACABCACBBCABCABBBAABCCCABBCBCB\".\n\n- **CBCABCCBCCCBCBBBACCBBCBCBACABCACBBCABCABBBAABCCCABBCBCB**\n  - CBC: No consecutive letters.\n  - AB: No consecutive letters.\n  - CC: Add 3 to the score (total score = 3).\n  - CB: No consecutive letters.\n  - CCC: Add 3 to the score (total score = 6).\n  - BC: No consecutive letters.\n  - BBB: Add 2 to the score (total score = 8).\n  - ACC: Add 3 to the score (total score = 11).\n  - BB: Add 2 to the score (total score = 13).\n  - CB: No consecutive letters.\n  - CB: No consecutive letters.\n  - AC: No consecutive letters.\n  - AB: No consecutive letters.\n  - CA: No consecutive letters.\n  - BB: Add 2 to the score (total score = 15).\n  - CA: No consecutive letters.\n  - BC: No consecutive letters.\n  - ABB: Add 2 to the score (total score = 17).\n  - BBA: Add 2 to the score (total score = 19).\n  - AB: No consecutive letters.\n  - CCC: Add 3 to the score (total score = 22).\n  - AB: No consecutive letters.\n  - BC: No consecutive letters.\n  - BC: No consecutive letters.\n  - B: No consecutive letters.\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is calculated as 22.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<22>>>"
