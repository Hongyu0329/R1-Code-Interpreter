    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given string \"DAABBAEAEDABBBBABACE\" step by step, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter and updating the total score accordingly. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: Go through the string from left to right.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **A's**: \n     - At positions 1 and 2, we have \"AA\". This is two consecutive A's, so add 1 to the score. Total score = 1.\n   - **B's**: \n     - At positions 3 and 4, we have \"BB\". This is two consecutive B's, so add 2 to the score. Total score = 3.\n     - At positions 11 to 14, we have \"BBBB\". This is four consecutive B's, so add 2 to the score. Total score = 5.\n   - **C's**: \n     - At positions 18 and 19, we have \"CC\". This is two consecutive C's, so add 3 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - **D's**: \n     - There are no consecutive D's in the string.\n   - **E's**: \n     - There are no consecutive E's in the string.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 8.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"DAABBAEAEDABBBBABACE\" is <<<8>>>."
