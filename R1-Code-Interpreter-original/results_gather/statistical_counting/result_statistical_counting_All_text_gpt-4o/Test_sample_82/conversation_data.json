    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"AA\", we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"BB\", we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"CC\", we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Move through the string, applying the above rules, and keep a running total of the score.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, in \"CCC\", we count it as one occurrence of consecutive 'C's, not two.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- **CBAACCCCCBBBACCBBABCCABBBCACBCBCCAACBBACBAAACBBCAABBAAB**\n\n1. \"AA\" at positions 3-4: +1\n2. \"CCCCC\" at positions 5-9: +3\n3. \"BBB\" at positions 10-12: +2\n4. \"CC\" at positions 14-15: +3\n5. \"BB\" at positions 16-17: +2\n6. \"CC\" at positions 20-21: +3\n7. \"BBB\" at positions 23-25: +2\n8. \"CC\" at positions 28-29: +3\n9. \"AA\" at positions 30-31: +1\n10. \"CC\" at positions 33-34: +3\n11. \"BB\" at positions 35-36: +2\n12. \"AA\" at positions 38-39: +1\n13. \"AA\" at positions 41-42: +1\n14. \"BB\" at positions 44-45: +2\n15. \"AA\" at positions 47-48: +1\n16. \"BB\" at positions 49-50: +2\n\nNow, sum up all the scores:\n\n1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 30\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 30.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<30>>>"
