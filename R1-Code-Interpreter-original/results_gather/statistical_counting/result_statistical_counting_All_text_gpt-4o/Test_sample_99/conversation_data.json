    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the string \"AAC\", the first two characters are 'A's, so we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the string \"BB\", we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the string \"CCCC\", we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Move through the string, applying the above rules wherever applicable.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, in \"CCCC\", we only add 3 once, not for each pair of 'C's.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- \"AAC\" -> Add 1 (for \"AA\")\n- \"BAB\" -> No consecutive letters\n- \"CCCCC\" -> Add 3 (for \"CC\"), add 3 (for \"CCC\")\n- \"BACCABBBC\" -> Add 2 (for \"BB\")\n- \"ABCABABAA\" -> Add 1 (for \"AA\")\n- \"CCBBB\" -> Add 3 (for \"CC\"), add 2 (for \"BB\")\n- \"ABCBCBBA\" -> Add 2 (for \"BB\")\n- \"ACACCCCB\" -> Add 3 (for \"CCC\"), add 3 (for \"CC\")\n- \"CCAAB\" -> Add 1 (for \"AA\")\n\nNow, let's sum up the scores:\n\n- From \"AAC\": +1\n- From \"CCCCC\": +3 +3\n- From \"BACCABBBC\": +2\n- From \"ABCABABAA\": +1\n- From \"CCBBB\": +3 +2\n- From \"ABCBCBBA\": +2\n- From \"ACACCCCB\": +3 +3\n- From \"CCAAB\": +1\n\nTotal score = 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 24\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is:\n\n<<<24>>>"
