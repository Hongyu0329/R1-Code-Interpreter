    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Apply the scoring rules**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n4. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - Start from the first character and move to the next.\n   - For each character, check if it is the same as the next one.\n   - If it is, check how many consecutive characters are there and apply the corresponding score.\n   - Move the index to the end of the current sequence of consecutive characters to avoid double counting.\n\n5. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - As we find sequences of consecutive characters, we update the total score accordingly.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given string:\n\n- **CABACBBCCBAABBBCBACCACABCAAAABCBACCAACBABBABACCBACACCBB**\n\n1. **C**: No consecutive C's.\n2. **A**: No consecutive A's.\n3. **B**: No consecutive B's.\n4. **A**: No consecutive A's.\n5. **CBB**: Two consecutive B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 2).\n6. **CC**: Two consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 5).\n7. **BAA**: Two consecutive A's, add 1 to the score (total score = 6).\n8. **BBB**: Three consecutive B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 8).\n9. **CB**: No consecutive B's.\n10. **ACC**: Two consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 11).\n11. **AC**: No consecutive C's.\n12. **AB**: No consecutive B's.\n13. **CAAA**: Four consecutive A's, add 1 to the score (total score = 12).\n14. **BCB**: No consecutive B's.\n15. **ACC**: Two consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 15).\n16. **AAC**: Two consecutive A's, add 1 to the score (total score = 16).\n17. **BABB**: Two consecutive B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 18).\n18. **AB**: No consecutive B's.\n19. **ACC**: Two consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 21).\n20. **BAC**: No consecutive C's.\n21. **ACC**: Two consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 24).\n22. **BB**: Two consecutive B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 26).\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is 26.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<26>>>"
