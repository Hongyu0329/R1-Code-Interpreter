    "To determine the total score of the string \"AACACCCCABCABCCCBBCBBBBBCBBAAABBAAC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **Consecutive A's**: Add 1 to the score for two or more consecutive 'A's.\n   - **Consecutive B's**: Add 2 to the score for two or more consecutive 'B's.\n   - **Consecutive C's**: Add 3 to the score for two or more consecutive 'C's.\n\n4. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n   - **\"AA\"**: The first two characters are 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 1.\n   - **\"C\"**: No consecutive 'C's here.\n   - **\"ACCCC\"**: There are four consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 4.\n   - **\"ABC\"**: No consecutive letters here.\n   - **\"ABCCC\"**: There are three consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 7.\n   - **\"BBC\"**: There are two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 9.\n   - **\"BBBBB\"**: There are five consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 11.\n   - **\"CBBAAA\"**: There are three consecutive 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 12.\n   - **\"BBAA\"**: There are two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 14.\n   - **\"AAC\"**: There are two consecutive 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 15.\n\n5. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 15.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<15>>>."
