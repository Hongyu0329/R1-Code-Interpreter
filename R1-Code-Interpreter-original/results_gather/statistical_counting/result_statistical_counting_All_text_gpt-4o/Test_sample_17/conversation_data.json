    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"ABABACEEBEEDECDBADEC\" step by step, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter from A to E and updating the total score accordingly. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, looking for consecutive occurrences of each letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - The string does not contain any consecutive A's. So, no points are added for A.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - The string does not contain any consecutive B's. So, no points are added for B.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - The string does not contain any consecutive C's. So, no points are added for C.\n\n6. **Check for consecutive D's**:\n   - The string does not contain any consecutive D's. So, no points are added for D.\n\n7. **Check for consecutive E's**:\n   - There are two consecutive E's at positions 5 and 6 (\"CEE\").\n   - There are two consecutive E's at positions 8 and 9 (\"BEE\").\n   - For each pair of consecutive E's, add 5 to the total score.\n   - Total score after processing E's: 5 (for \"CEE\") + 5 (for \"BEE\") = 10.\n\n8. **Final total score**: After scanning the entire string and applying the rules, the total score is 10.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"ABABACEEBEEDECDBADEC\" is <<<10>>>."
