    "To determine the total score of the given string \"AABBBCCABAACCABABCCBBBCCBCABCCABCBBABBBACBACC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"AA\", we have two consecutive 'A's, so we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"BBB\", we have three consecutive 'B's, so we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"CC\", we have two consecutive 'C's, so we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning the string**: Move to the next character after processing a sequence of consecutive letters and repeat the checks until the end of the string.\n\n7. **Calculate the total score**: Sum up all the points added during the scan to get the final total score.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score = 1)\n- \"BBB\" -> Add 2 (total score = 3)\n- \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score = 6)\n- \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score = 7)\n- \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score = 10)\n- \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score = 13)\n- \"BBB\" -> Add 2 (total score = 15)\n- \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score = 18)\n- \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score = 21)\n- \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score = 23)\n- \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score = 25)\n- \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score = 28)\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is 28.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<28>>>."
