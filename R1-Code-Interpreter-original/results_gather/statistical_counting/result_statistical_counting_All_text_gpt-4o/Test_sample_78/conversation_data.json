    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BCCBAAAACCBBABCBBCBBAABAAABBBABBBCCABAACCCBBA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right and identify sequences of consecutive 'A's, 'B's, and 'C's.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules:**\n   - For two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Score:**\n   - Start with a total score of 0.\n   - Traverse the string and apply the scoring rules whenever consecutive characters are found.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- **BCCBAAAACCBBABCBBCBBAABAAABBBABBBCCABAACCCBBA**\n\n1. **BCC**: \n   - 'CC' is a sequence of two 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n\n2. **BAAAA**: \n   - 'AAA' is a sequence of three 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 4.\n\n3. **CC**: \n   - 'CC' is a sequence of two 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 7.\n\n4. **BB**: \n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 9.\n\n5. **ABCBBC**: \n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 11.\n\n6. **BBAA**: \n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 13.\n   - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 14.\n\n7. **ABAA**: \n   - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 15.\n\n8. **BBB**: \n   - 'BBB' is a sequence of three 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 17.\n\n9. **ABB**: \n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 19.\n\n10. **CC**: \n    - 'CC' is a sequence of two 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 22.\n\n11. **ABAACCC**: \n    - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 23.\n    - 'CCC' is a sequence of three 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 26.\n\n12. **BBA**: \n    - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 28.\n\n**Final Total Score:**\n- After analyzing the entire string, the total score is 28.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<28>>>."
