    "To determine the total score of the string \"BCFABFDFECFFBFAECDEBEDCDC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **B**: There are no consecutive B's in the string.\n   - **C**: There are no consecutive C's in the string.\n   - **F**: There are two consecutive F's at positions 9 and 10. According to the rule, add 6 to the total score.\n   - **A**: There are no consecutive A's in the string.\n   - **D**: There are no consecutive D's in the string.\n   - **E**: There are no consecutive E's in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**: \n   - The only consecutive letters found were two F's, which added 6 to the total score.\n\n5. **Final score**: The total score after scanning the entire string is 6.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"BCFABFDFECFFBFAECDEBEDCDC\" is <<<6>>>."
