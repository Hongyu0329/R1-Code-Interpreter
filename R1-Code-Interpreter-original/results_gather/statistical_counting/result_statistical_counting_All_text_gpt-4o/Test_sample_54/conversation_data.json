    "To determine the total score of the string \"ABCCCAACAABCBACBCABCBBABBBBBBACABBC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to find sequences of two or more consecutive 'A's, 'B's, or 'C's.\n\n2. **Calculate Score for Each Sequence:**\n   - For each sequence of consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - For each sequence of consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score.\n   - For each sequence of consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score.\n\n3. **Scan the String:**\n   - Start from the beginning of the string and move to the end, checking for consecutive characters.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **ABCCCAACAABCBACBCABCBBABBBBBBACABBC**\n     - **AB**: No consecutive characters.\n     - **CCCA**: Three consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n     - **AACA**: Two consecutive 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 4.\n     - **ABCB**: No consecutive characters.\n     - **ACBC**: No consecutive characters.\n     - **ABCBB**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 6.\n     - **ABBBBB**: Five consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 8.\n     - **BACABBC**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 10.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - After scanning the entire string, the total score is calculated based on the sequences found.\n\nThe total score of the string is <<<10>>>."
