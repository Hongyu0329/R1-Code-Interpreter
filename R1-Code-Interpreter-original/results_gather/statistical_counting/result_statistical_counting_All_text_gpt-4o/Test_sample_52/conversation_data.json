    "To determine the total score of the string \"ABACABCBBBBCCCABBBAACCBCCCBABBBCACB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - There are no two consecutive A's in the string, so no points are added for A's.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - At positions 7-10, we have \"BBBB\", which are four consecutive B's. According to the rule, we add 2 points for this sequence.\n   - At positions 16-18, we have \"BBB\", which are three consecutive B's. We add another 2 points.\n   - At positions 28-31, we have \"BBBB\", which are four consecutive B's. We add another 2 points.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - At positions 11-13, we have \"CCC\", which are three consecutive C's. According to the rule, we add 3 points for this sequence.\n   - At positions 21-23, we have \"CC\", which are two consecutive C's. We add another 3 points.\n   - At positions 24-26, we have \"CCC\", which are three consecutive C's. We add another 3 points.\n\n6. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - Points from consecutive B's: 2 (from positions 7-10) + 2 (from positions 16-18) + 2 (from positions 28-31) = 6 points.\n   - Points from consecutive C's: 3 (from positions 11-13) + 3 (from positions 21-23) + 3 (from positions 24-26) = 9 points.\n\n7. **Final total score**: Add the points from B's and C's together: 6 (from B's) + 9 (from C's) = 15.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<15>>>"
