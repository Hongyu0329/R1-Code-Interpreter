    "To determine the total score of the string \"FADAADABCEBCDFBAFDFAAFFFE\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for Consecutive Letters**:\n   - **F**: The string starts with \"F\". No consecutive F's here.\n   - **A**: Next is \"A\". No consecutive A's yet.\n   - **D**: Next is \"D\". No consecutive D's.\n   - **AA**: We have two consecutive A's here. According to rule 1, add 1 to the total score. Total score = 1.\n   - **D**: Next is \"D\". No consecutive D's.\n   - **AB**: No consecutive A's or B's.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **AA**: We have two consecutive A's again. Add 1 to the total score. Total score = 2.\n   - **FFF**: We have three consecutive F's. According to rule 6, add 6 to the total score. Total score = 8.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 8.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"FADAADABCEBCDFBAFDFAAFFFE\" is <<<8>>>."
