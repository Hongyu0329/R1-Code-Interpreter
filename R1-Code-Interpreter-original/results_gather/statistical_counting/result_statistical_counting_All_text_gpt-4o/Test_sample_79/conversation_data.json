    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BCBACCBCBABBAAABAAABCABBCCCCBBCCCAAABBAACCBCB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right and identify sequences of consecutive 'A's, 'B's, and 'C's.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules:**\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Score:**\n   - Initialize the total score to 0.\n   - Traverse the string and apply the scoring rules whenever a sequence of consecutive characters is found.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **BCBACCBCBABBAAABAAABCABBCCCCBBCCCAAABBAACCBCB**\n\n1. **BB** (at index 9-10): Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 2.\n2. **AAA** (at index 12-14): Three consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 3.\n3. **AA** (at index 16-17): Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 4.\n4. **CCCC** (at index 24-27): Four consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 7.\n5. **BB** (at index 28-29): Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 9.\n6. **CCC** (at index 30-32): Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 12.\n7. **AAA** (at index 33-35): Three consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 13.\n8. **BB** (at index 36-37): Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 15.\n9. **CC** (at index 38-39): Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 18.\n\nAfter analyzing the entire string, the total score is calculated as 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
