    "To determine the total score of the string \"BBDCECEAEAABCEDEDDAC\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Total Score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will scan the string from left to right and look for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Identify Consecutive Letters**:\n   - **BBDCECEAEAABCEDEDDAC**\n   - **BBD**: The first two letters are 'B's. According to rule 2, two consecutive 'B's add 2 to the score. Total score = 0 + 2 = 2.\n   - **DCECEAEAABCEDEDDAC**: No consecutive 'D's, 'C's, or 'E's here.\n   - **CECEAEAABCEDEDDAC**: No consecutive 'C's or 'E's here.\n   - **EAABCEDEDDAC**: The next two consecutive letters are 'A's. According to rule 1, two consecutive 'A's add 1 to the score. Total score = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - **BCEDEDDAC**: No consecutive 'B's, 'C's, or 'E's here.\n   - **EDDAC**: The next two consecutive letters are 'D's. According to rule 4, two consecutive 'D's add 4 to the score. Total score = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\n4. **Final Total Score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 7.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"BBDCECEAEAABCEDEDDAC\" is <<<7>>>."
