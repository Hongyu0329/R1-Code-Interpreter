    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n6. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, if there are three consecutive 'B's, it should only contribute 2 to the score, not 4.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the string:\n\n- **BABACACACCAABBBBABACCBBBBCCCCBBBCBCBCAABCBCACBBBCCCACCC**\n\n1. **BABACACACCAABBBBABACCBBBBCCCCBBBCBCBCAABCBCACBBBCCCACCC**\n   - 'BB' at index 1-2: +2\n   - 'CC' at index 6-7: +3\n   - 'AA' at index 9-10: +1\n   - 'BBBB' at index 11-14: +2\n   - 'CC' at index 17-18: +3\n   - 'BBBB' at index 19-22: +2\n   - 'CCCC' at index 23-26: +3\n   - 'BBB' at index 27-29: +2\n   - 'BB' at index 35-36: +2\n   - 'BBB' at index 41-43: +2\n   - 'CCC' at index 44-46: +3\n   - 'CC' at index 48-49: +3\n\n2. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - Total score = 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 28\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<28>>>."
