    "To determine the total score of the string \"DEDABCBFDBDDCBAAFBDCCEBAC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of each letter and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **D**: \n     - The string has \"DD\" at positions 8-9. According to rule 4, add 4 to the score.\n     - The score is now 4.\n   - **A**: \n     - The string has \"AA\" at positions 14-15. According to rule 1, add 1 to the score.\n     - The score is now 5.\n   - **B**: \n     - There are no consecutive B's in the string.\n   - **C**: \n     - The string has \"CC\" at positions 19-20. According to rule 3, add 3 to the score.\n     - The score is now 8.\n   - **E**: \n     - There are no consecutive E's in the string.\n   - **F**: \n     - There are no consecutive F's in the string.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string and applying the rules, the total score is 8.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"DEDABCBFDBDDCBAAFBDCCEBAC\" is <<<8>>>."
