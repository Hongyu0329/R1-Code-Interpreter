    "To determine the total score of the string \"ABCBACCDBCDBADA\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive letters as specified in the rules.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - The string is \"ABCBACCDBCDBADA\".\n   - There are no consecutive A's in the string.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - The string is \"ABCBACCDBCDBADA\".\n   - There are no consecutive B's in the string.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - The string is \"ABCBACCDBCDBADA\".\n   - There are two consecutive C's at positions 5 and 6.\n   - Add 3 to the total score. The total score is now 3.\n\n6. **Check for consecutive D's**:\n   - The string is \"ABCBACCDBCDBADA\".\n   - There are no consecutive D's in the string.\n\n7. **Final total score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"ABCBACCDBCDBADA\" is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>."
