    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"CFAABCAADDBAFDCBDFAECAEDA\" step by step, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter from A to F and updating the total score accordingly. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: Go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - At index 1 and 2, we have \"AA\". This is a pair of consecutive A's, so we add 1 to the total score. Total score = 1.\n   - At index 5 and 6, we have another \"AA\". Add 1 to the total score. Total score = 2.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - At index 8 and 9, we have \"BB\". This is a pair of consecutive B's, so we add 2 to the total score. Total score = 4.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - There are no consecutive C's in the string.\n\n6. **Check for consecutive D's**:\n   - At index 10 and 11, we have \"DD\". This is a pair of consecutive D's, so we add 4 to the total score. Total score = 8.\n\n7. **Check for consecutive E's**:\n   - There are no consecutive E's in the string.\n\n8. **Check for consecutive F's**:\n   - There are no consecutive F's in the string.\n\n9. **Final Calculation**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 8.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"CFAABCAADDBAFDCBDFAECAEDA\" is <<<8>>>."
