    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Move to the next character and repeat the process until the end of the string.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, \"AAA\" should only add 1 to the score, not 2.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- **BACBBCBBCBBCBAACCABABABABCBBACBCABBAAAAAABABCCCBABCCCAB**\n\n1. **BAC**: No consecutive letters.\n2. **BB**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 2.\n3. **CBB**: No new consecutive letters.\n4. **BBC**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 4.\n5. **BBC**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 6.\n6. **BAA**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1. Total score = 7.\n7. **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 10.\n8. **ABABABAB**: No consecutive letters.\n9. **CBB**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 12.\n10. **ACBCABBA**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 14.\n11. **AAAAAA**: Two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1. Total score = 15.\n12. **BABCC**: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 18.\n13. **CBABCCC**: Two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 21.\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is calculated as 21.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
