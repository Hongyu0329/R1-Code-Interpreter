    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the string \"AABBBBBCBCBBABCCBACABBCAACABBBCCCCACCAACACAAA\", the first two characters are 'A's, so we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - In the string, after the initial 'A's, we have \"BBBB\", which are four consecutive 'B's, so we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - Later in the string, we find \"CC\" and \"CCCC\", each occurrence adds 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: We continue this process for the entire string, ensuring that we only add to the score when we encounter a new set of consecutive letters.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that once a sequence has been counted, it is not counted again. For example, \"BBBB\" is counted once for 'B's, not twice.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the string:\n\n- \"AA\" -> +1 (total score: 1)\n- \"BBBB\" -> +2 (total score: 3)\n- \"CC\" -> +3 (total score: 6)\n- \"BB\" -> +2 (total score: 8)\n- \"CC\" -> +3 (total score: 11)\n- \"CCC\" -> +3 (total score: 14)\n- \"CC\" -> +3 (total score: 17)\n- \"AAA\" -> +1 (total score: 18)\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
