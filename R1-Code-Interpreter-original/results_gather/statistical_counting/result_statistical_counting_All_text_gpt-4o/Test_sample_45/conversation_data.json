    "To determine the total score of the string \"BACCCBBACAABABBAACCBBAACCBBABCBACBB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to find sequences of two or more consecutive 'A's, 'B's, or 'C's.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules:**\n   - For two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score.\n\n3. **Scan the String:**\n   - Start from the beginning and move to the end, checking for consecutive characters.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- **BACCCBBACAABABBAACCBBAACCBBABCBACBB**\n\n1. **BACCC**: \n   - 'CCC' is a sequence of three 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n\n2. **BB**:\n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 5.\n\n3. **ACAAB**:\n   - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 6.\n\n4. **BABBAA**:\n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 9.\n\n5. **CC**:\n   - 'CC' is a sequence of two 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 12.\n\n6. **BB**:\n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 14.\n\n7. **AACC**:\n   - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 15.\n   - 'CC' is a sequence of two 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 18.\n\n8. **BB**:\n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 20.\n\n9. **ABCBACBB**:\n   - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 22.\n\n**Final Total Score:**\n- After scanning the entire string and applying the scoring rules, the total score is 22.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<22>>>."
