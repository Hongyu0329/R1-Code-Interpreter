    "To determine the total score of the string \"BCCCABCBBACACCBCABACBCBCBACBBABCCBA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right and identify any consecutive occurrences of the same character.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules:**\n   - For two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start with an initial score of 0.\n   - **BCCC**: There are three consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n   - **ABC**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 3.\n   - **BB**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 5.\n   - **AC**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 5.\n   - **ACC**: Two consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - **BC**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 8.\n   - **AB**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 8.\n   - **AC**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 8.\n   - **BC**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 8.\n   - **BC**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 8.\n   - **BA**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 8.\n   - **CBB**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 10.\n   - **AB**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 10.\n   - **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 13.\n   - **BA**: No consecutive characters. Total score remains 13.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - After scanning the entire string, the total score is 13.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<13>>>."
