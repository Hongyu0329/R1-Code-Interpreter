    "To determine the total score of the string \"ACCBBBACCABACBCCCBCAAABCCBBBCBCCBCA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **A's**: \n     - At index 0, we have 'A'. No consecutive 'A's here.\n     - At index 18-20, we have \"AAA\". This is a sequence of three 'A's, so we add 1 to the score.\n   - **B's**:\n     - At index 3-5, we have \"BBB\". This is a sequence of three 'B's, so we add 2 to the score.\n     - At index 23-25, we have \"BBB\". This is another sequence of three 'B's, so we add 2 to the score.\n   - **C's**:\n     - At index 1-2, we have \"CC\". This is a sequence of two 'C's, so we add 3 to the score.\n     - At index 14-16, we have \"CCC\". This is a sequence of three 'C's, so we add 3 to the score.\n     - At index 28-30, we have \"CCC\". This is another sequence of three 'C's, so we add 3 to the score.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - From the sequences of 'A's, we added 1.\n   - From the sequences of 'B's, we added 2 + 2 = 4.\n   - From the sequences of 'C's, we added 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.\n\n5. **Sum up the scores**: \n   - Total score = 1 (from A's) + 4 (from B's) + 9 (from C's) = 14.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 14.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<14>>>"
