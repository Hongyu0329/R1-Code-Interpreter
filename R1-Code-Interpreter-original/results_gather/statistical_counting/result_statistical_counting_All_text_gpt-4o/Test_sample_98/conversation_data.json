    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n4. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - Start from the first character and move to the next, keeping track of consecutive characters.\n   - Whenever a different character is encountered, check the count of the previous consecutive characters and update the score accordingly.\n   - Reset the count for the new character and continue.\n\n5. **Edge cases**:\n   - Ensure that the end of the string is handled properly, checking the last sequence of consecutive characters.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given string:\n\n- The string is: `BBBBCCBABACBABCCCBBAACCCCBBBBACCBCCABBBACABBABBAACBABCA`\n\n- **Step-by-step analysis**:\n  - `BBBB`: 4 consecutive 'B's → Add 2 to the score (score = 2)\n  - `CC`: 2 consecutive 'C's → Add 3 to the score (score = 5)\n  - `B`: Single 'B' → No score change\n  - `A`: Single 'A' → No score change\n  - `B`: Single 'B' → No score change\n  - `A`: Single 'A' → No score change\n  - `C`: Single 'C' → No score change\n  - `B`: Single 'B' → No score change\n  - `A`: Single 'A' → No score change\n  - `B`: Single 'B' → No score change\n  - `C`: Single 'C' → No score change\n  - `C`: Single 'C' → No score change\n  - `C`: 3 consecutive 'C's → Add 3 to the score (score = 8)\n  - `BB`: 2 consecutive 'B's → Add 2 to the score (score = 10)\n  - `AA`: 2 consecutive 'A's → Add 1 to the score (score = 11)\n  - `CCCC`: 4 consecutive 'C's → Add 3 to the score (score = 14)\n  - `BBBB`: 4 consecutive 'B's → Add 2 to the score (score = 16)\n  - `AC`: Single 'A' and 'C' → No score change\n  - `CB`: Single 'C' and 'B' → No score change\n  - `CC`: 2 consecutive 'C's → Add 3 to the score (score = 19)\n  - `ABBB`: 3 consecutive 'B's → Add 2 to the score (score = 21)\n  - `AC`: Single 'A' and 'C' → No score change\n  - `ABB`: 2 consecutive 'B's → Add 2 to the score (score = 23)\n  - `A`: Single 'A' → No score change\n  - `BBAA`: 2 consecutive 'B's and 2 consecutive 'A's → Add 2 + 1 to the score (score = 26)\n  - `CB`: Single 'C' and 'B' → No score change\n  - `A`: Single 'A' → No score change\n  - `BCA`: Single 'B', 'C', and 'A' → No score change\n\nAfter analyzing the entire string, the total score is calculated to be 26.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<26>>>"
