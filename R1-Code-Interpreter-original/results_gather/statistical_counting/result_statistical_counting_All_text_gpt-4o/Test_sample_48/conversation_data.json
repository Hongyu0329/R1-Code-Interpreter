    "To determine the total score of the string \"BABBACCCBACBACCCCABCBABCBCAABCABBAA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **Consecutive A's**: If there are two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - **Consecutive B's**: If there are two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score.\n   - **Consecutive C's**: If there are two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score.\n\n4. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n   - **BABBACCCBACBACCCCABCBABCBCAABCABBAA**:\n     - **BABB**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 2.\n     - **ACCC**: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 5.\n     - **BACBACCCC**: Four consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 8.\n     - **ABCBABCBCAABCABBAA**: \n       - **AABC**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 9.\n       - **ABBAA**: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 11.\n       - **AA**: Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 12.\n\n5. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 12.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<12>>>."
