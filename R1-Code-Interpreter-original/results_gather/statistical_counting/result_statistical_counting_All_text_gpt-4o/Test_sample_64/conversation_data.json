    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BAACBAAAABBBABABAAACAACABCBCCBCACCCBACABCCCBB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right and identify sequences of consecutive 'A's, 'B's, and 'C's.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules:**\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - For each sequence of two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Score:**\n   - Initialize the total score to 0.\n   - Traverse the string and apply the scoring rules whenever a sequence of consecutive characters is found.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **BAAC**: \n  - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's, so add 1 to the score. Total score = 1.\n\n- **CBAAAA**: \n  - 'AAAA' is a sequence of four 'A's, so add 1 to the score. Total score = 2.\n\n- **BBB**: \n  - 'BBB' is a sequence of three 'B's, so add 2 to the score. Total score = 4.\n\n- **ABABAA**: \n  - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's, so add 1 to the score. Total score = 5.\n\n- **ACAAC**: \n  - 'AA' is a sequence of two 'A's, so add 1 to the score. Total score = 6.\n\n- **ABCBCC**: \n  - 'CC' is a sequence of two 'C's, so add 3 to the score. Total score = 9.\n\n- **BCACCC**: \n  - 'CCC' is a sequence of three 'C's, so add 3 to the score. Total score = 12.\n\n- **BACABCCC**: \n  - 'CCC' is a sequence of three 'C's, so add 3 to the score. Total score = 15.\n\n- **BB**: \n  - 'BB' is a sequence of two 'B's, so add 2 to the score. Total score = 17.\n\nAfter analyzing the entire string, the final total score is 17.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<17>>>."
