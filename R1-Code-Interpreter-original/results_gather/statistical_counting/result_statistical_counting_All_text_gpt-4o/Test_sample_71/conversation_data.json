    "To determine the total score of the given string \"ABCCCBCAABBACBACCBAACAACCACCBBBBAABAABCCABAAA\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score to 0.**\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back:**\n\n   - **Identify consecutive letters:**\n     - Look for sequences of two or more consecutive 'A's, 'B's, or 'C's.\n     - For each sequence found, add the corresponding points to the total score:\n       - Add 1 point for each sequence of two or more consecutive 'A's.\n       - Add 2 points for each sequence of two or more consecutive 'B's.\n       - Add 3 points for each sequence of two or more consecutive 'C's.\n\n3. **Step-by-step analysis of the string:**\n\n   - **ABCCCBCAABBACBACCBAACAACCACCBBBBAABAABCCABAAA**\n   \n   - **ABCCCBCAABBACBACCBAACAACCACCBBBBAABAABCCABAAA**\n     - 'A': No consecutive 'A's initially.\n     - 'B': No consecutive 'B's initially.\n     - 'CCC': Three consecutive 'C's, add 3 points. Total score = 3.\n     - 'B': No consecutive 'B's.\n     - 'C': No consecutive 'C's.\n     - 'AA': Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 point. Total score = 4.\n     - 'BB': Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 points. Total score = 6.\n     - 'A': No consecutive 'A's.\n     - 'C': No consecutive 'C's.\n     - 'B': No consecutive 'B's.\n     - 'ACC': Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 points. Total score = 9.\n     - 'BA': No consecutive 'A's.\n     - 'A': No consecutive 'A's.\n     - 'CA': No consecutive 'A's.\n     - 'ACC': Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 points. Total score = 12.\n     - 'ACC': Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 points. Total score = 15.\n     - 'BBB': Three consecutive 'B's, add 2 points. Total score = 17.\n     - 'B': No additional 'B's.\n     - 'AA': Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 point. Total score = 18.\n     - 'BA': No consecutive 'A's.\n     - 'AB': No consecutive 'B's.\n     - 'CC': Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 points. Total score = 21.\n     - 'AB': No consecutive 'B's.\n     - 'AAA': Three consecutive 'A's, add 1 point. Total score = 22.\n\n4. **Final total score:**\n\n   After analyzing the entire string, the total score is 22.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<22>>>."
