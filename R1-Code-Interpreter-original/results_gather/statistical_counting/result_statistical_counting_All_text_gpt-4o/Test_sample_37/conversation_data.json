    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"FCDDFEDEEFFBDFCEDDBEBAADC\" step by step, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter from A to F and updating the total score accordingly. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: Go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **F**: Look for consecutive F's. In the string, \"FF\" appears once. Add 6 to the total score.\n   - **C**: Look for consecutive C's. There are no consecutive C's, so the score remains unchanged.\n   - **D**: Look for consecutive D's. \"DD\" appears twice. Add 4 for each occurrence, totaling 8.\n   - **E**: Look for consecutive E's. There are no consecutive E's, so the score remains unchanged.\n   - **B**: Look for consecutive B's. There are no consecutive B's, so the score remains unchanged.\n   - **A**: Look for consecutive A's. \"AA\" appears once. Add 1 to the total score.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - From \"FF\", add 6.\n   - From two occurrences of \"DD\", add 8 (4 + 4).\n   - From \"AA\", add 1.\n\n5. **Sum up the scores**: 6 (from FF) + 8 (from DD) + 1 (from AA) = 15.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<15>>>"
