    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string and apply the scoring rules based on consecutive letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the Total Score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will iterate through the string from the first character to the last.\n\n3. **Check for Consecutive A's**:\n   - If we encounter two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - We need to ensure that we only add 1 for each group of consecutive 'A's, regardless of how many 'A's are in the group.\n\n4. **Check for Consecutive B's**:\n   - If we encounter two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - Similar to 'A's, we add 2 for each group of consecutive 'B's.\n\n5. **Check for Consecutive C's**:\n   - If we encounter two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - Again, we add 3 for each group of consecutive 'C's.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the String**:\n   - As we iterate, we keep track of the current character and compare it with the next one.\n   - If they are the same, we continue to check for further consecutive characters.\n   - Once we find a different character, we apply the scoring rule for the group of consecutive characters we just passed.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the end of the string is handled correctly, especially if it ends with a group of consecutive characters.\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to the given string:\n\n- The string is: `BACABABCCBACACBABAACCCCBBCCAAAABCAACBBCCABABCAABAAACAAB`\n\n- We will go through the string and apply the rules:\n\n  - **Consecutive A's**: Found at positions 17-18, 21-24, 30-31, 34-35, 38-39, 42-43. Total score from A's = 6.\n  - **Consecutive B's**: Found at positions 7-8, 26-27, 32-33, 45-46. Total score from B's = 8.\n  - **Consecutive C's**: Found at positions 19-20, 22-23, 28-29, 36-37, 40-41. Total score from C's = 15.\n\n- **Calculate Total Score**: Add up the scores from all groups:\n  - Total score = 6 (from A's) + 8 (from B's) + 15 (from C's) = 29.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is:\n\n<<<29>>>"
