    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BCBBCBACCBBCBBABBCBACBABCCCBBCABCCCBCBBCABACC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\nNow, let's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **BCBBCBACCBBCBBABBCBACBABCCCBBCABCCCBCBBCABACC**:\n  - BCB: No consecutive letters.\n  - BBC: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 2.\n  - BAC: No consecutive letters.\n  - CCB: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 5.\n  - BBC: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 7.\n  - BB: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 9.\n  - AB: No consecutive letters.\n  - BC: No consecutive letters.\n  - BAC: No consecutive letters.\n  - BAB: No consecutive letters.\n  - CCC: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 12.\n  - BBC: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 14.\n  - AB: No consecutive letters.\n  - CCC: Three consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 17.\n  - BC: No consecutive letters.\n  - BBC: Two consecutive 'B's, add 2. Total score = 19.\n  - AB: No consecutive letters.\n  - ACC: Two consecutive 'C's, add 3. Total score = 22.\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is 22.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<22>>>"
