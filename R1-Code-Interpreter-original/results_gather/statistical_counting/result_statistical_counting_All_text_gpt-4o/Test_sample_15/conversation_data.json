    "To determine the total score of the string \"ADBCCCDBDBAAEADBABCC\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will go through each character in the string and check for consecutive occurrences of the same letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - The string has \"AA\" at positions 10 and 11. According to rule 1, add 1 to the total score.\n   - Total score = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - There are no consecutive B's in the string, so no points are added for B's.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - The string has \"CCC\" at positions 3, 4, and 5. According to rule 3, add 3 to the total score.\n   - Total score = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - The string also has \"CC\" at positions 18 and 19. According to rule 3, add another 3 to the total score.\n   - Total score = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\n6. **Check for consecutive D's**:\n   - There are no consecutive D's in the string, so no points are added for D's.\n\n7. **Check for consecutive E's**:\n   - There are no consecutive E's in the string, so no points are added for E's.\n\nAfter analyzing the entire string, the total score is calculated as follows:\n\n- 1 point for \"AA\"\n- 3 points for \"CCC\"\n- 3 points for \"CC\"\n\nThus, the final total score is 7.\n\nThe answer is: <<<7>>>"
