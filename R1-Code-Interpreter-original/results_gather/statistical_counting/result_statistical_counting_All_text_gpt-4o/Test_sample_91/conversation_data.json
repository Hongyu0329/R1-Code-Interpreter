    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"AA\", we have two consecutive 'A's, so we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"BB\", we have two consecutive 'B's, so we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"CC\", we have two consecutive 'C's, so we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Move through the string, applying the above rules wherever applicable.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that overlapping sequences are not counted multiple times. For example, in \"AAA\", the sequence is counted as one occurrence of consecutive 'A's, not two.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- \"AABCBCCABCBBACAACBBCBBCABACAACBCBABABCABBACBBCAACBCAACB\"\n\n1. \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 1)\n2. \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 4)\n3. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 6)\n4. \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 9)\n5. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 11)\n6. \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 12)\n7. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 14)\n8. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 16)\n9. \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 17)\n10. \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 20)\n11. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 22)\n12. \"BB\" -> Add 2 (total score: 24)\n13. \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 25)\n14. \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 28)\n15. \"AA\" -> Add 1 (total score: 29)\n16. \"CC\" -> Add 3 (total score: 32)\n\nAfter scanning the entire string, the total score is 32.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<32>>>"
