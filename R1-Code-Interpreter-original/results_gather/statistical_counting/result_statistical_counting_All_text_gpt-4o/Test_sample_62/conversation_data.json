    "To determine the total score of the given string \"AACBCABBBBCABCACBCCABABCBBCABACAABBBAABCABBBA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score** to 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back** and look for consecutive letters:\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"AACBCABBBBCABCACBCCABABCBBCABACAABBBAABCABBBA\".\n   - **Index 0-1**: \"AA\" - Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 1.\n   - **Index 2-3**: \"CB\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 4-5**: \"CA\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 6-9**: \"BBBB\" - Four consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 3.\n   - **Index 10-11**: \"CA\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 12-13**: \"BC\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 14-15**: \"AC\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 16-18**: \"BCC\" - Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 6.\n   - **Index 19-20**: \"AB\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 21-22**: \"AB\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 23-24**: \"CB\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 25-26**: \"BC\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 27-28**: \"AB\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 29-30**: \"AC\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 31-33**: \"AABB\" - Two consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score. Total score = 7.\n   - **Index 34-36**: \"BBA\" - Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 9.\n   - **Index 37-38**: \"ABC\" - No consecutive letters.\n   - **Index 39-40**: \"ABB\" - Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 11.\n   - **Index 41-43**: \"BBA\" - Two consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score. Total score = 13.\n\n4. **Final total score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 13.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<13>>>."
