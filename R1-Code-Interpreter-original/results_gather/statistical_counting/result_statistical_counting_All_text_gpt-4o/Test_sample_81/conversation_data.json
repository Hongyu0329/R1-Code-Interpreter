    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Move to the next character and repeat the process until the end of the string.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, if there are three consecutive 'B's, it should only contribute 2 to the score, not 4.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- **String**: CACACCAABABCBABBBBBBBCACAABBABACBBCBCAAABCBBACCAACBCCBB\n\n- **Step-by-step analysis**:\n  - CACA**CC**AABABCBAB**BBBBB**BCACA**AABB**ABAC**BB**CBCA**AABC**BBACCAACBC**CC**BB\n  - **CC**: Add 3 (for two consecutive 'C's)\n  - **BBBBB**: Add 2 (for two consecutive 'B's)\n  - **AABB**: Add 1 (for two consecutive 'A's)\n  - **BB**: Add 2 (for two consecutive 'B's)\n  - **AABC**: Add 1 (for two consecutive 'A's)\n  - **CC**: Add 3 (for two consecutive 'C's)\n  - **BB**: Add 2 (for two consecutive 'B's)\n\n- **Total score calculation**:\n  - 3 (for CC) + 2 (for BBBBB) + 1 (for AABB) + 2 (for BB) + 1 (for AABC) + 3 (for CC) + 2 (for BB) = 14\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 14.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<14>>>"
