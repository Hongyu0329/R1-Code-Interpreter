    "To determine the total score of the string \"ABBBA\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules:\n\n1. **Initialize the Total Score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will scan the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Identify Consecutive A's**:\n   - The string starts with 'A', but there is only one 'A' at the beginning, so no score is added for consecutive A's here.\n\n4. **Identify Consecutive B's**:\n   - After the initial 'A', we encounter 'B', 'B', 'B'. This is a sequence of three consecutive B's.\n   - According to the rule, if there are two or more consecutive B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - Since we have three consecutive B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n\n5. **Continue Scanning**:\n   - After the sequence of B's, we encounter another 'A'. There are no consecutive A's here, so no score is added for A's.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n   - We have identified one sequence of consecutive B's, which added 2 to the total score.\n   - There were no sequences of consecutive A's that met the criteria for scoring.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total score after scanning the entire string is 2.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"ABBBA\" is <<<2>>>."
