    "To determine the total score of the string \"ABCAABACACBBBBAAABBCCCCCBBABAAABBAA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - At index 3-4: \"AA\" is found, add 1 to the score. Total score = 1.\n   - At index 14-16: \"AAA\" is found, add 1 to the score. Total score = 2.\n   - At index 30-31: \"AA\" is found, add 1 to the score. Total score = 3.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - At index 9-12: \"BBBB\" is found, add 2 to the score. Total score = 5.\n   - At index 24-25: \"BB\" is found, add 2 to the score. Total score = 7.\n   - At index 33-34: \"BB\" is found, add 2 to the score. Total score = 9.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - At index 18-22: \"CCCCC\" is found, add 3 to the score. Total score = 12.\n\n6. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is calculated.\n\nThe total score of the string \"ABCAABACACBBBBAAABBCCCCCBBABAAABBAA\" is <<<12>>>."
