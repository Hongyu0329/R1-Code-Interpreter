    "To determine the total score of the given string \"AACAAACABCBCBABCBAAABBABCABCBAACABABBAAABCACB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: Go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - If two or more consecutive 'A's are found, add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"AA\", we have two consecutive 'A's, so we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - If two or more consecutive 'B's are found, add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"BB\", we have two consecutive 'B's, so we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - If two or more consecutive 'C's are found, add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"CC\", we have two consecutive 'C's, so we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Continue this process for the entire string, ensuring that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once.\n\n7. **Calculate the total score**: Sum up all the points added during the scan.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- \"AAC\": Two consecutive 'A's, add 1.\n- \"AAAC\": Three consecutive 'A's, add 1 (only count once).\n- \"AAABB\": Two consecutive 'A's, add 1.\n- \"BB\": Two consecutive 'B's, add 2.\n- \"AAABC\": Two consecutive 'A's, add 1.\n- \"BAAC\": Two consecutive 'A's, add 1.\n- \"ABBAA\": Two consecutive 'B's, add 2.\n- \"AAABC\": Two consecutive 'A's, add 1.\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<10>>>."
