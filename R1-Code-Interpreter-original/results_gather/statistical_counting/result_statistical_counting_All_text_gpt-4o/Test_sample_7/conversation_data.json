    "To determine the total score of the string \"DCBDADCCAABCCBB\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: \n   - We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for Consecutive A's**:\n   - Look for two or more consecutive 'A's. \n   - In the string, \"AAB\" is found, which means there are two consecutive 'A's. \n   - According to the rule, add 1 to the total score. \n   - Total score = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n4. **Check for Consecutive B's**:\n   - Look for two or more consecutive 'B's.\n   - In the string, \"BB\" is found at the end, which means there are two consecutive 'B's.\n   - According to the rule, add 2 to the total score.\n   - Total score = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n5. **Check for Consecutive C's**:\n   - Look for two or more consecutive 'C's.\n   - In the string, \"CC\" is found twice: once in \"DADCC\" and once in \"AABCC\".\n   - Each occurrence of \"CC\" adds 3 to the total score.\n   - First occurrence: Total score = 3 + 3 = 6.\n   - Second occurrence: Total score = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\n6. **Check for Consecutive D's**:\n   - Look for two or more consecutive 'D's.\n   - In the string, there are no consecutive 'D's.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After scanning the entire string and applying the rules, the total score is 9.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"DCBDADCCAABCCBB\" is <<<9>>>."
