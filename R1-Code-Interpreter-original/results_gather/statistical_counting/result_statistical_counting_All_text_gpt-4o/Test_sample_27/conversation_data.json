    "To determine the total score of the string \"FBBEBDFEBBBCFBDDEFABDACCD\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of each letter and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's at the start.\n   - **BB**: Two consecutive B's are found. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 2.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **BB**: Two consecutive B's are found again. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 4.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **DD**: Two consecutive D's are found. Add 4 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's.\n   - **CC**: Two consecutive C's are found. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 11.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 11.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"FBBEBDFEBBBCFBDDEFABDACCD\" is <<<11>>>."
