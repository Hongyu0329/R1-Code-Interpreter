    "To determine the total score of the string \"ABACACAABC\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will examine each character and its consecutive characters to check for sequences of two or more identical letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - The string is \"ABACACAABC\".\n   - There are no consecutive A's at the start.\n   - At position 5 and 6, we have \"AA\". This is a sequence of two consecutive A's, so we add 1 to the total score. The total score is now 1.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - Continue scanning the string.\n   - At position 8 and 9, we have \"BB\". This is a sequence of two consecutive B's, so we add 2 to the total score. The total score is now 3.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - Continue scanning the string.\n   - At position 3 and 4, we have \"CC\". This is a sequence of two consecutive C's, so we add 3 to the total score. The total score is now 6.\n\n6. **Final calculation**:\n   - After scanning the entire string, the total score is 6.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"ABACACAABC\" is <<<6>>>."
