    "To determine the total score of the string \"DBDBDEBCCAEBBCADBEDD\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of each letter and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **D**: The string starts with \"DBDBD\". There are no consecutive D's initially. However, at the end of the string, we have \"EDD\", which contains two consecutive D's. According to rule 4, we add 4 to the score.\n   - **B**: The string has \"BB\" at positions 11 and 12. According to rule 2, we add 2 to the score.\n   - **C**: The string has \"CC\" at positions 8 and 9. According to rule 3, we add 3 to the score.\n   - **A**: There are no consecutive A's in the string.\n   - **E**: There are no consecutive E's in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - From \"BB\", we add 2.\n   - From \"CC\", we add 3.\n   - From \"EDD\", we add 4.\n\n5. **Sum up the scores**: 2 (from B) + 3 (from C) + 4 (from D) = 9.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"DBDBDEBCCAEBBCADBEDD\" is 9.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<9>>>."
