    "To determine the total score of the string \"BAADCAAADBDCDAA\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Total Score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will scan the string from left to right and look for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Identify Consecutive Letters**:\n   - **B**: The first character is 'B'. There are no consecutive 'B's here, so no score is added.\n   - **AA**: The next two characters are 'A's. Since there are two consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score. Total score is now 1.\n   - **D**: The next character is 'D'. There are no consecutive 'D's here, so no score is added.\n   - **C**: The next character is 'C'. There are no consecutive 'C's here, so no score is added.\n   - **AAA**: The next three characters are 'A's. Since there are three consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score. Total score is now 2.\n   - **D**: The next character is 'D'. There are no consecutive 'D's here, so no score is added.\n   - **B**: The next character is 'B'. There are no consecutive 'B's here, so no score is added.\n   - **D**: The next character is 'D'. There are no consecutive 'D's here, so no score is added.\n   - **C**: The next character is 'C'. There are no consecutive 'C's here, so no score is added.\n   - **D**: The next character is 'D'. There are no consecutive 'D's here, so no score is added.\n   - **AA**: The last two characters are 'A's. Since there are two consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score. Total score is now 3.\n\n4. **Final Total Score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"BAADCAAADBDCDAA\" is <<<3>>>."
