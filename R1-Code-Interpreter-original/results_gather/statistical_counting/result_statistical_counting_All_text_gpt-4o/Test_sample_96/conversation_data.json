    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"AA\", we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"BB\", we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"CC\", we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning**: Move through the string, applying the above rules, and keep a running total of the score.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each set of consecutive letters is only counted once. For example, \"CCC\" should only add 3 to the score, not 6.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- **ACCC**: \"CCC\" adds 3 to the score.\n- **AACCC**: \"AA\" adds 1, \"CCC\" adds 3.\n- **ABBBBBBBB**: \"BBBBBBBB\" adds 2.\n- **CCCCCBBAA**: \"CCCCC\" adds 3, \"BB\" adds 2, \"AA\" adds 1.\n- **BACAAAC**: \"AAA\" adds 1.\n- **ABCACABBBAAABBCBBCCAA**: \"BBB\" adds 2, \"AA\" adds 1, \"BB\" adds 2, \"CC\" adds 3, \"AA\" adds 1.\n\nNow, let's sum up the scores:\n\n- From \"ACCC\": 3\n- From \"AACCC\": 1 + 3 = 4\n- From \"ABBBBBBBB\": 2\n- From \"CCCCCBBAA\": 3 + 2 + 1 = 6\n- From \"BACAAAC\": 1\n- From \"ABCACABBBAAABBCBBCCAA\": 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9\n\nTotal score = 3 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 9 = 25\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<25>>>."
