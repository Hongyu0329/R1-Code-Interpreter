    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Apply the rules**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n4. **Count consecutive letters**: As we scan the string, we need to keep track of consecutive letters and apply the scoring rules whenever we encounter a sequence of two or more identical letters.\n\n5. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - Start from the first character and move to the next.\n   - Keep a count of consecutive identical letters.\n   - When the current letter is different from the previous one, check the count of the previous letter:\n     - If it was 'A' and the count is 2 or more, add 1 to the score.\n     - If it was 'B' and the count is 2 or more, add 2 to the score.\n     - If it was 'C' and the count is 2 or more, add 3 to the score.\n   - Reset the count for the new letter and continue.\n\n6. **Handle the end of the string**: After the loop, check the last sequence of letters since it might not be followed by a different letter to trigger the scoring.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given string:\n\n- **String**: ACABBBBAAABCACCABBAABCCABBCCCCBBCCAABBBBCACBABCCBCBBBBB\n\n- **Step-by-step analysis**:\n  - A: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - C: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - A: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - BBBB: 4 consecutive B's, add 2 to score\n  - AAA: 3 consecutive A's, add 1 to score\n  - BC: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - ACC: 2 consecutive C's, add 3 to score\n  - AB: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - BA: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - AB: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - CC: 2 consecutive C's, add 3 to score\n  - ABB: 2 consecutive B's, add 2 to score\n  - CCCC: 4 consecutive C's, add 3 to score\n  - BB: 2 consecutive B's, add 2 to score\n  - CC: 2 consecutive C's, add 3 to score\n  - A: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - BBBB: 4 consecutive B's, add 2 to score\n  - CAC: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - BAB: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - CC: 2 consecutive C's, add 3 to score\n  - BC: 1 (no consecutive)\n  - BBBBB: 5 consecutive B's, add 2 to score\n\n- **Total score calculation**:\n  - 2 (from BBBB) + 1 (from AAA) + 3 (from CC) + 3 (from CC) + 2 (from BB) + 3 (from CCCC) + 2 (from BB) + 3 (from CC) + 2 (from BBBB) + 3 (from CC) + 2 (from BBBBB) = 28\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is:\n\n<<<28>>>"
