    "To determine the total score of the string \"BCBBABAACBAAAABAABBBCBBBBCCCBCBBBAA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Identify Consecutive Letters**:\n   - **B**: Check for consecutive B's and add 2 to the score for each occurrence.\n   - **C**: Check for consecutive C's and add 3 to the score for each occurrence.\n   - **A**: Check for consecutive A's and add 1 to the score for each occurrence.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - **BCBB**: There are two consecutive B's (\"BB\"), so add 2 to the score. Total score = 2.\n   - **ABAAC**: There are two consecutive A's (\"AA\"), so add 1 to the score. Total score = 3.\n   - **BAAAA**: There are three consecutive A's (\"AAA\"), so add 1 to the score. Total score = 4.\n   - **BAABBB**: There are two consecutive B's (\"BB\"), so add 2 to the score. Total score = 6.\n   - **BBC**: There are two consecutive B's (\"BB\"), so add 2 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - **BBCCC**: There are three consecutive C's (\"CCC\"), so add 3 to the score. Total score = 11.\n   - **BCBBBAA**: There are three consecutive B's (\"BBB\"), so add 2 to the score. Total score = 13.\n   - **AA**: There are two consecutive A's (\"AA\"), so add 1 to the score. Total score = 14.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 14.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<14>>>."
