    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**: \n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**: \n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**: \n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n6. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that each sequence of consecutive letters is only counted once.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the string \"ABBBBBBCABACABABBBACCBACCACBAACBACABACBAABBBC\":\n\n- **ABBBBBB**: There are 6 consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **B**: 3 consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n- **C**: 2 consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n- **C**: 2 consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **A**: 2 consecutive 'A's. Add 1 to the score.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **A**: No consecutive 'A's.\n- **A**: 2 consecutive 'A's. Add 1 to the score.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **B**: 3 consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score.\n- **B**: No consecutive 'B's.\n- **C**: No consecutive 'C's.\n\nAdding up the scores from each step: 2 (from BBBBBB) + 2 (from BBB) + 3 (from CC) + 3 (from CC) + 1 (from AA) + 1 (from AA) + 2 (from BBB) = 16.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<16>>>."
