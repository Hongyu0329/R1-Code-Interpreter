    "To determine the total score of the given string \"ACCBCBCCACABBCCCCAAABABABBBACAABABBCBBAAACBAC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score** to 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back** and look for consecutive letters:\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - If there are two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n   - Start with the first character and move through the string.\n   - Identify consecutive sequences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n   - For each sequence, determine if it meets the criteria (two or more consecutive letters).\n   - Add the appropriate score for each sequence to the total score.\n\n4. **Detailed breakdown**:\n   - \"ACC\" -> \"CC\" is a sequence of 2 'C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 3).\n   - \"BC\" -> no consecutive sequence.\n   - \"BCC\" -> \"CC\" is a sequence of 2 'C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 6).\n   - \"CAC\" -> no consecutive sequence.\n   - \"ABB\" -> \"BB\" is a sequence of 2 'B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 8).\n   - \"CCCC\" -> \"CCCC\" is a sequence of 4 'C's, add 3 to the score (total score = 11).\n   - \"AAA\" -> \"AAA\" is a sequence of 3 'A's, add 1 to the score (total score = 12).\n   - \"BABAB\" -> no consecutive sequence.\n   - \"BB\" -> \"BB\" is a sequence of 2 'B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 14).\n   - \"ACA\" -> no consecutive sequence.\n   - \"AAB\" -> \"AA\" is a sequence of 2 'A's, add 1 to the score (total score = 15).\n   - \"ABBC\" -> \"BB\" is a sequence of 2 'B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 17).\n   - \"BBA\" -> \"BB\" is a sequence of 2 'B's, add 2 to the score (total score = 19).\n   - \"AAC\" -> \"AA\" is a sequence of 2 'A's, add 1 to the score (total score = 20).\n   - \"BAC\" -> no consecutive sequence.\n\n5. **Final total score**: After scanning the entire string and applying the rules, the total score is 20.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<20>>>."
