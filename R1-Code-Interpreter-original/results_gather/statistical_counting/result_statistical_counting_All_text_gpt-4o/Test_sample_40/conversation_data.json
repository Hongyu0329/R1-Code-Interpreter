    "To determine the total score of the string \"ABBAAACCBCABBACABCCCBCABACCCBCCBACA\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Start with a total score of 0.\n   - We will scan the string from left to right.\n\n2. **Scan the String:**\n   - **ABBAAACCBCABBACABCCCBCABACCCBCCBACA**\n\n3. **Identify Consecutive Letters:**\n   - **BB**: Found at index 1-2. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 2.\n   - **AAA**: Found at index 4-6. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 3.\n   - **CC**: Found at index 7-8. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 6.\n   - **BB**: Found at index 10-11. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 8.\n   - **CC**: Found at index 16-17. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 11.\n   - **CCC**: Found at index 19-21. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 14.\n   - **CC**: Found at index 24-25. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 17.\n   - **CC**: Found at index 28-29. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 20.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - After scanning the entire string, the total score is 20.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<20>>>."
