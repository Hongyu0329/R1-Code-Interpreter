    "To determine the total score of the string \"AACABBCBAB\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: \n   - We will go through the string character by character and check for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - **Characters 1-2**: \"AA\"\n     - There are two consecutive 'A's.\n     - According to rule 1, add 1 to the total score.\n     - Total score = 0 + 1 = 1.\n   - **Characters 3**: \"C\"\n     - No consecutive 'C's here.\n     - Total score remains 1.\n   - **Characters 4**: \"A\"\n     - No consecutive 'A's here.\n     - Total score remains 1.\n   - **Characters 5-6**: \"BB\"\n     - There are two consecutive 'B's.\n     - According to rule 2, add 2 to the total score.\n     - Total score = 1 + 2 = 3.\n   - **Characters 7**: \"C\"\n     - No consecutive 'C's here.\n     - Total score remains 3.\n   - **Characters 8**: \"B\"\n     - No consecutive 'B's here.\n     - Total score remains 3.\n   - **Characters 9**: \"A\"\n     - No consecutive 'A's here.\n     - Total score remains 3.\n   - **Characters 10**: \"B\"\n     - No consecutive 'B's here.\n     - Total score remains 3.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After scanning the entire string, the total score is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"AACABBCBAB\" is <<<3>>>."
