    "To determine the total score of the string \"BCACACACDADADCD\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Start with a total score of 0.\n   - The string to analyze is \"BCACACACDADADCD\".\n\n2. **Scan the String**:\n   - We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for Consecutive A's**:\n   - There are no consecutive A's in the string. So, no points are added for A's.\n\n4. **Check for Consecutive B's**:\n   - There are no consecutive B's in the string. So, no points are added for B's.\n\n5. **Check for Consecutive C's**:\n   - The string has \"CACACAC\", but no two consecutive C's. So, no points are added for C's.\n\n6. **Check for Consecutive D's**:\n   - The string has \"DADADCD\", but no two consecutive D's. So, no points are added for D's.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After scanning the entire string, no conditions for adding points are met. Therefore, the total score remains 0.\n\nThe total score of the string \"BCACACACDADADCD\" is <<<0>>>."
