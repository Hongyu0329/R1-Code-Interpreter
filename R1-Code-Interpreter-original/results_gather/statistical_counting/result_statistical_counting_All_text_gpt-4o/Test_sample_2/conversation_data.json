    "To determine the total score of the string \"ACCABCBACA\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will examine each character and its consecutive characters to apply the scoring rules.\n\n3. **Apply the scoring rules**:\n   - **Rule 1**: If there are two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - **Rule 2**: If there are two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - **Rule 3**: If there are two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n4. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n   - **Characters 1-2**: \"AC\" - No consecutive 'A's or 'C's.\n   - **Characters 2-3**: \"CC\" - Two consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n   - **Characters 3-4**: \"CA\" - No consecutive 'C's or 'A's.\n   - **Characters 4-5**: \"AB\" - No consecutive 'A's or 'B's.\n   - **Characters 5-6**: \"BC\" - No consecutive 'B's or 'C's.\n   - **Characters 6-7**: \"CB\" - No consecutive 'C's or 'B's.\n   - **Characters 7-8**: \"BA\" - No consecutive 'B's or 'A's.\n   - **Characters 8-9**: \"AC\" - No consecutive 'A's or 'C's.\n   - **Characters 9-10**: \"CA\" - No consecutive 'C's or 'A's.\n\n5. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"ACCABCBACA\" is <<<3>>>."
