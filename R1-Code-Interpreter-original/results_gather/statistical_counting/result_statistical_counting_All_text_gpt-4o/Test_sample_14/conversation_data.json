    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"ABBABACEAABEEBDBCBCC\" step by step, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter and updating the total score accordingly. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: Go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**:\n   - The string has \"AA\" at positions 7-8. Add 1 to the total score.\n   - Total score is now 1.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**:\n   - The string has \"BB\" at positions 1-2. Add 2 to the total score.\n   - Total score is now 3.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**:\n   - The string has \"CC\" at positions 18-19. Add 3 to the total score.\n   - Total score is now 6.\n\n6. **Check for consecutive D's**:\n   - There are no consecutive D's in the string.\n\n7. **Check for consecutive E's**:\n   - The string has \"EE\" at positions 10-11. Add 5 to the total score.\n   - Total score is now 11.\n\nAfter scanning the entire string and applying the rules for consecutive letters, the final total score is calculated.\n\nThe total score of the string \"ABBABACEAABEEBDBCBCC\" is <<<11>>>."
