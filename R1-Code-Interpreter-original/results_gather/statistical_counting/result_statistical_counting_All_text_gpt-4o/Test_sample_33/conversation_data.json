    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"DAADBCBAECFFCEFDBEBABFCAD\" and calculate the total score based on the rules provided. Let's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of each letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **A**: Look for two or more consecutive 'A's. In the string, we have \"AA\" at positions 2 and 3. This adds 1 to the total score.\n   - **B**: Look for two or more consecutive 'B's. There are no consecutive 'B's in the string.\n   - **C**: Look for two or more consecutive 'C's. There are no consecutive 'C's in the string.\n   - **D**: Look for two or more consecutive 'D's. There are no consecutive 'D's in the string.\n   - **E**: Look for two or more consecutive 'E's. There are no consecutive 'E's in the string.\n   - **F**: Look for two or more consecutive 'F's. We have \"FF\" at positions 11 and 12. This adds 6 to the total score.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**: \n   - From the consecutive 'A's, we added 1 to the score.\n   - From the consecutive 'F's, we added 6 to the score.\n   - Total score = 1 (from 'A') + 6 (from 'F') = 7.\n\n5. **Format the answer**: According to the problem, the answer should be formatted as <<<number>>>.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<7>>>."
