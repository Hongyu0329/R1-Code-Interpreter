    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BABCACCABBCABCAACCCACABBCABBBCCCBBAAACABACBAC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive 'A's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"AA\", we add 1 to the score.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive 'B's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"BB\", we add 2 to the score.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive 'C's**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n   - For example, in the substring \"CC\", we add 3 to the score.\n\n6. **Continue scanning the string**: Move to the next character after processing a sequence of consecutive letters.\n\n7. **Avoid double counting**: Ensure that overlapping sequences are not counted multiple times. For example, in \"CCC\", we count it as one sequence of three 'C's, not as two sequences of two 'C's.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- \"BABCACCABBCABCAACCCACABBCABBBCCCBBAAACABACBAC\"\n\n1. \"BABCACCA\" - No consecutive 'A's or 'B's, but \"CC\" adds 3 to the score.\n2. \"BB\" - Adds 2 to the score.\n3. \"CAACCC\" - \"AA\" adds 1, \"CCC\" adds 3.\n4. \"ACABBC\" - \"BB\" adds 2.\n5. \"ABBB\" - \"BB\" adds 2, \"BBB\" adds 2 (since we already counted the first \"BB\").\n6. \"CCCBBAAAC\" - \"CCC\" adds 3, \"BB\" adds 2, \"AAA\" adds 1.\n7. \"ABACBAC\" - No consecutive letters.\n\nAdding up all the scores:\n- 3 (from \"CC\") + 2 (from \"BB\") + 1 (from \"AA\") + 3 (from \"CCC\") + 2 (from \"BB\") + 2 (from \"BB\") + 3 (from \"CCC\") + 2 (from \"BB\") + 1 (from \"AAA\") = 20\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 20.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<20>>>"
