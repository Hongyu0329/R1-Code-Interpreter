If there are two or more consecutive A's, add 1 to the total score.\n2. If there are two or more consecutive B's, add 2 to the total score.\n3. If there are two or more consecutive C's, add 3 to the total score.\n4. If there are two or more consecutive D's, add 4 to the total score.\n5. If there are two or more consecutive E's, add 5 to the total score.\n\nWhat is the total score of the string ABCEEBEBCEECEDDBEBCA?\nReturn your answer with the format <<<number>>>, like <<<5>>> means the total score is 5.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"ABCEEBEBCEECEDDBEBCA\" and calculate the total score based on the rules provided. Let's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive A's**: \n   - There are no consecutive A's in the string.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**: \n   - There are no consecutive B's in the string.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive C's**: \n   - There are no consecutive C's in the string.\n\n6. **Check for consecutive D's**: \n   - At positions 14 and 15, we have \"DD\". This adds 4 to the total score.\n\n7. **Check for consecutive E's**: \n   - At positions 3 and 4, we have \"EE\". This adds 5 to the total score.\n   - At positions 9 and 10, we have another \"EE\". This adds another 5 to the total score.\n\n8. **Calculate the total score**: \n   - From the consecutive D's, we added 4.\n   - From the first pair of consecutive E's, we added 5.\n   - From the second pair of consecutive E's, we added another 5.\n\n9. **Final total score**: \n   - Total score = 4 (from D's) + 5 (from first E's) + 5 (from second E's) = 14.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 14.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<14>>>"
