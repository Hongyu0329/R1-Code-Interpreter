    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, checking for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Apply the scoring rules**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n4. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - Start from the first character and move to the next.\n   - Keep track of the current character and count how many times it appears consecutively.\n   - When the character changes, check the count:\n     - If the count is 2 or more, apply the corresponding score based on the character.\n   - Reset the count for the new character and continue.\n\n5. **Edge cases**:\n   - Ensure that the end of the string is handled correctly by checking the last sequence of characters.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given string:\n\n- **String**: ACAABACBAABABAAABCBBCBACCCBCCABBCAABBABBBACACCCCAACBBBA\n\n- **Step-by-step analysis**:\n  - A: 1 occurrence\n  - C: 1 occurrence\n  - A: 2 consecutive (score +1)\n  - B: 1 occurrence\n  - A: 1 occurrence\n  - C: 1 occurrence\n  - B: 1 occurrence\n  - A: 2 consecutive (score +1)\n  - B: 1 occurrence\n  - A: 1 occurrence\n  - B: 3 consecutive (score +2)\n  - A: 3 consecutive (score +1)\n  - B: 1 occurrence\n  - C: 1 occurrence\n  - B: 2 consecutive (score +2)\n  - C: 1 occurrence\n  - B: 1 occurrence\n  - A: 1 occurrence\n  - C: 3 consecutive (score +3)\n  - B: 1 occurrence\n  - C: 2 consecutive (score +3)\n  - A: 1 occurrence\n  - B: 2 consecutive (score +2)\n  - C: 1 occurrence\n  - A: 2 consecutive (score +1)\n  - B: 1 occurrence\n  - B: 3 consecutive (score +2)\n  - A: 1 occurrence\n  - C: 1 occurrence\n  - A: 4 consecutive (score +1)\n  - C: 1 occurrence\n  - B: 3 consecutive (score +2)\n  - A: 1 occurrence\n\n- **Total score calculation**:\n  - A: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n  - B: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\n  - C: 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- **Final total score**: 4 (A) + 8 (B) + 6 (C) = 18\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<18>>>."
