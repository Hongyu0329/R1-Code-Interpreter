    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given string \"EBAAAAACACAACAADAABC\" step by step, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter and updating the total score accordingly. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive E's**: \n   - The string starts with \"E\", but there is only one \"E\" at the beginning, so no score is added.\n\n4. **Check for consecutive B's**: \n   - The next letter is \"B\", but there is only one \"B\", so no score is added.\n\n5. **Check for consecutive A's**: \n   - The next sequence is \"AAAAA\". There are 5 consecutive \"A's\", which is more than 2, so we add 1 to the total score. \n   - Total score = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n6. **Check for consecutive C's**: \n   - After the \"A's\", there is a single \"C\", so no score is added.\n\n7. **Check for consecutive A's again**: \n   - Next, we have \"ACAAC\". The \"A's\" are not consecutive initially, but then we have \"AA\", which are 2 consecutive \"A's\". We add 1 to the total score.\n   - Total score = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n8. **Check for consecutive C's again**: \n   - After the \"AA\", there is a single \"C\", so no score is added.\n\n9. **Check for consecutive A's again**: \n   - Next, we have \"ADA\". The \"A's\" are not consecutive, so no score is added.\n\n10. **Check for consecutive D's**: \n    - After the \"A\", there is a single \"D\", so no score is added.\n\n11. **Check for consecutive A's again**: \n    - After the \"D\", there is a single \"A\", so no score is added.\n\n12. **Check for consecutive B's again**: \n    - Finally, we have \"BC\". The \"B's\" are not consecutive, so no score is added.\n\n13. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 2.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"EBAAAAACACAACAADAABC\" is <<<2>>>."
