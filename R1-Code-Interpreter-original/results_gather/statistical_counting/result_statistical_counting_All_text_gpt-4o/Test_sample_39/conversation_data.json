    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"AFECEFFFAFDADFECBADBFAADF\" and calculate the total score based on the rules provided. Let's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of the same letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **A**: There are no consecutive A's at the beginning. However, at the end of the string, we have \"AA\", which adds 1 to the total score.\n   - **B**: There are no consecutive B's in the string.\n   - **C**: There are no consecutive C's in the string.\n   - **D**: There are no consecutive D's in the string.\n   - **E**: There are no consecutive E's in the string.\n   - **F**: We have \"FFF\" in the string, which adds 6 to the total score.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - From \"FFF\", we add 6 to the score.\n   - From \"AA\", we add 1 to the score.\n\n5. **Final total score**: Add up all the points from the consecutive letters found:\n   - Total score = 6 (from \"FFF\") + 1 (from \"AA\") = 7.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<7>>>"
