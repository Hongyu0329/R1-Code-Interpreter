    "To determine the total score of the string \"FDFDADAEBCAEAFCCAEDFDEDAA\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of each letter and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **FDFDADAEBCAEAFCCAEDFDEDAA**:\n     - F: No consecutive F's initially.\n     - D: No consecutive D's initially.\n     - F: No consecutive F's.\n     - D: No consecutive D's.\n     - A: No consecutive A's initially.\n     - D: No consecutive D's.\n     - A: No consecutive A's.\n     - E: No consecutive E's.\n     - B: No consecutive B's.\n     - C: No consecutive C's.\n     - A: No consecutive A's.\n     - E: No consecutive E's.\n     - A: No consecutive A's.\n     - F: No consecutive F's.\n     - C: Two consecutive C's found. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n     - C: Already counted.\n     - A: No consecutive A's.\n     - E: No consecutive E's.\n     - D: No consecutive D's.\n     - F: No consecutive F's.\n     - D: No consecutive D's.\n     - E: No consecutive E's.\n     - D: No consecutive D's.\n     - A: Two consecutive A's found. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 4.\n     - A: Already counted.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 4.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<4>>>."
