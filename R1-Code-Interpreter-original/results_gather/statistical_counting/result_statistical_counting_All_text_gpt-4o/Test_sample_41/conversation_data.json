    "To determine the total score of the string \"AAAACCCCBCAAABCACCBAABAAAABACBCABAA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive A's:**\n   - \"AAAA\" (positions 0-3): 4 consecutive A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - \"AA\" (positions 21-22): 2 consecutive A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - \"AAAA\" (positions 24-27): 4 consecutive A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - \"AA\" (positions 34-35): 2 consecutive A's, add 1 to the score.\n\n2. **Identify Consecutive B's:**\n   - \"BB\" (positions 8-9): 2 consecutive B's, add 2 to the score.\n   - \"BB\" (positions 18-19): 2 consecutive B's, add 2 to the score.\n\n3. **Identify Consecutive C's:**\n   - \"CCCC\" (positions 4-7): 4 consecutive C's, add 3 to the score.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total score by adding up the points from each identified sequence:\n\n- From consecutive A's: 1 (AAAA) + 1 (AA) + 1 (AAAA) + 1 (AA) = 4\n- From consecutive B's: 2 (BB) + 2 (BB) = 4\n- From consecutive C's: 3 (CCCC) = 3\n\nAdding these together gives us the total score:\n\n4 (from A's) + 4 (from B's) + 3 (from C's) = 11\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
