    "To determine the total score of the string \"AABFBEAFBADEBBFBAAEDCCEEE\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Total Score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the String**: We will scan the string from left to right and look for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Identify Consecutive Letters**:\n   - **A**: The string starts with \"AAB\". There are two consecutive A's, so we add 1 to the total score. Total score = 1.\n   - **B**: Next, we have \"BF\". No consecutive B's here.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **B**: We encounter \"BB\" here. There are two consecutive B's, so we add 2 to the total score. Total score = 3.\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's.\n   - **A**: We encounter \"AA\" here. There are two consecutive A's, so we add 1 to the total score. Total score = 4.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **C**: We encounter \"CC\" here. There are two consecutive C's, so we add 3 to the total score. Total score = 7.\n   - **E**: We encounter \"EEE\" here. There are three consecutive E's, so we add 5 to the total score. Total score = 12.\n\n4. **Final Total Score**: After scanning the entire string, the final total score is 12.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"AABFBEAFBADEBBFBAAEDCCEEE\" is <<<12>>>."
