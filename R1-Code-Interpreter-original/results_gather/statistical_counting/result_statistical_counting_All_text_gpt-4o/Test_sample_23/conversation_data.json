    "To determine the total score of the string \"ACFCBFBCCAFECCFEDFDECBEBB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string from left to right, checking for consecutive letters.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **A**: There are no consecutive A's in the string.\n   - **B**: There are two consecutive B's at the end of the string (\"BB\"). According to the rule, add 2 to the total score.\n   - **C**: There are two consecutive C's twice in the string (\"CC\" at positions 7-8 and \"CC\" at positions 12-13). Each occurrence adds 3 to the total score, so add 3 + 3 = 6.\n   - **D**: There are no consecutive D's in the string.\n   - **E**: There are no consecutive E's in the string.\n   - **F**: There are no consecutive F's in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - From the consecutive B's, we add 2.\n   - From the consecutive C's, we add 6 (3 for each pair of consecutive C's).\n\n5. **Final total score**: Add up all the points: 2 (from B's) + 6 (from C's) = 8.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is 8.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<8>>>"
