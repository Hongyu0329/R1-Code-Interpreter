    "To determine the total score of the given string, we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters**: We need to scan the string and identify sequences of consecutive 'A's, 'B's, and 'C's.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules**:\n   - For two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Scan the String**: We will go through the string character by character and keep track of consecutive sequences.\n\n4. **Calculate the Score**:\n   - Start with a total score of 0.\n   - As we identify each sequence of consecutive characters, apply the corresponding score increment.\n\nLet's go through the string:\n\n- **CCCC**: Four consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n- **B**: Single 'B'. No score added.\n- **A**: Single 'A'. No score added.\n- **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 6.\n- **AAA**: Three consecutive 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 7.\n- **C**: Single 'C'. No score added.\n- **AA**: Two consecutive 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 8.\n- **C**: Single 'C'. No score added.\n- **A**: Single 'A'. No score added.\n- **C**: Single 'C'. No score added.\n- **B**: Single 'B'. No score added.\n- **A**: Single 'A'. No score added.\n- **B**: Single 'B'. No score added.\n- **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 11.\n- **BCBCBCB**: No consecutive sequences of two or more identical characters. No score added.\n- **AAAA**: Four consecutive 'A's. Add 1 to the score. Total score = 12.\n- **BBB**: Three consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 14.\n- **CB**: No consecutive sequences. No score added.\n- **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 17.\n- **BB**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 19.\n- **C**: Single 'C'. No score added.\n- **BBC**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 21.\n- **AC**: No consecutive sequences. No score added.\n- **B**: Single 'B'. No score added.\n- **AC**: No consecutive sequences. No score added.\n- **BB**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 23.\n- **C**: Single 'C'. No score added.\n- **BB**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 25.\n- **CC**: Two consecutive 'C's. Add 3 to the score. Total score = 28.\n- **BB**: Two consecutive 'B's. Add 2 to the score. Total score = 30.\n\nAfter analyzing the entire string, the final total score is 30.\n\nThe answer is: <<<30>>>"
