    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BBCBAAACCCCCCCBCACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right and identify sequences of consecutive 'A's, 'B's, and 'C's.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules:**\n   - For two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the total score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the total score.\n   - For two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Score:**\n   - Start with an initial score of 0.\n   - Traverse the string and apply the scoring rules whenever a sequence of consecutive characters is found.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **BB**CBAAACCCCCCCBCACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC: \"BB\" adds 2 to the score.\n- BB**C**BAAACCCCCCCBCACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC: No consecutive 'C's.\n- BBCB**AAA**CCCCCCCBCACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC: \"AAA\" adds 1 to the score.\n- BBCBAAA**CCCCCCC**BCACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC: \"CCCCCCC\" adds 3 to the score.\n- BBCBAAACCCCCCCB**C**ACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC: No consecutive 'C's.\n- BBCBAAACCCCCCCBCACB**CCC**ACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC: \"CCC\" adds 3 to the score.\n- BBCBAAACCCCCCCBCACBCCCA**CC**ABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC: \"CC\" adds 3 to the score.\n- BBCBAAACCCCCCCBCACBCCCACCAB**ACCCC**BCBCBBACACBBC: \"CCCC\" adds 3 to the score.\n- BBCBAAACCCCCCCBCACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBC**BB**ACACBBC: \"BB\" adds 2 to the score.\n- BBCBAAACCCCCCCBCACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACB**BC**: \"BC\" does not add to the score.\n- BBCBAAACCCCCCCBCACBCCCACCABACCCCBCBCBBACACBBC: No more consecutive sequences.\n\n**Total Score Calculation:**\n- \"BB\" adds 2\n- \"AAA\" adds 1\n- \"CCCCCCC\" adds 3\n- \"CCC\" adds 3\n- \"CC\" adds 3\n- \"CCCC\" adds 3\n- \"BB\" adds 2\n\nAdding these scores together: 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 17\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<17>>>."
