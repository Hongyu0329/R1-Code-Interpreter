    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BACCCCCCACCCCCCAACCACCCABCBBAACABCCCBCCCABBAA\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **Consecutive A's**: If there are two or more consecutive 'A's, add 1 to the score.\n   - **Consecutive B's**: If there are two or more consecutive 'B's, add 2 to the score.\n   - **Consecutive C's**: If there are two or more consecutive 'C's, add 3 to the score.\n\n4. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's at the start.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's at the start.\n   - **CCCCCC**: Six consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (score = 3).\n   - **A**: Single A, no score change.\n   - **CCCCCC**: Six consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (score = 6).\n   - **AA**: Two consecutive A's, add 1 to the score (score = 7).\n   - **C**: Single C, no score change.\n   - **A**: Single A, no score change.\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (score = 10).\n   - **A**: Single A, no score change.\n   - **B**: Single B, no score change.\n   - **C**: Single C, no score change.\n   - **BB**: Two consecutive B's, add 2 to the score (score = 12).\n   - **AA**: Two consecutive A's, add 1 to the score (score = 13).\n   - **C**: Single C, no score change.\n   - **A**: Single A, no score change.\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (score = 16).\n   - **B**: Single B, no score change.\n   - **CCC**: Three consecutive C's, add 3 to the score (score = 19).\n   - **AB**: No consecutive A's or B's, no score change.\n   - **BAA**: Two consecutive A's, add 1 to the score (score = 20).\n\n5. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 20.\n\nThe total score of the string is <<<20>>>."
