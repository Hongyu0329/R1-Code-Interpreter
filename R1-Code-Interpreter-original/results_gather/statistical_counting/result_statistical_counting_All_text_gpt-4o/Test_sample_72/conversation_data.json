    "To determine the total score of the given string \"BCCCBBABCBCBCCBAACCACCBCACCBAACBACCABCACBCCBB\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will go through the string character by character and look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\n\n3. **Apply the scoring rules**:\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'A's, we add 1 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'B's, we add 2 to the total score.\n   - If we find two or more consecutive 'C's, we add 3 to the total score.\n\n4. **Keep track of consecutive characters**: As we scan the string, we need to keep track of the current character and how many times it has appeared consecutively.\n\n5. **Update the score**: Whenever we encounter a change in character or reach the end of the string, we check the count of the consecutive characters and update the score if the count is two or more.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **BCCC**: \n  - 'B' appears once, no score.\n  - 'C' appears three times consecutively, add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n\n- **BB**: \n  - 'B' appears two times consecutively, add 2 to the score. Total score = 5.\n\n- **A**: \n  - 'A' appears once, no score.\n\n- **B**: \n  - 'B' appears once, no score.\n\n- **C**: \n  - 'C' appears once, no score.\n\n- **BC**: \n  - 'B' and 'C' appear once each, no score.\n\n- **CB**: \n  - 'C' and 'B' appear once each, no score.\n\n- **CC**: \n  - 'C' appears two times consecutively, add 3 to the score. Total score = 8.\n\n- **BAA**: \n  - 'B' appears once, no score.\n  - 'A' appears two times consecutively, add 1 to the score. Total score = 9.\n\n- **CC**: \n  - 'C' appears two times consecutively, add 3 to the score. Total score = 12.\n\n- **AC**: \n  - 'A' and 'C' appear once each, no score.\n\n- **CB**: \n  - 'C' and 'B' appear once each, no score.\n\n- **CA**: \n  - 'C' and 'A' appear once each, no score.\n\n- **CC**: \n  - 'C' appears two times consecutively, add 3 to the score. Total score = 15.\n\n- **BAA**: \n  - 'B' appears once, no score.\n  - 'A' appears two times consecutively, add 1 to the score. Total score = 16.\n\n- **CB**: \n  - 'C' and 'B' appear once each, no score.\n\n- **ACC**: \n  - 'A' appears once, no score.\n  - 'C' appears two times consecutively, add 3 to the score. Total score = 19.\n\n- **ABC**: \n  - 'A', 'B', and 'C' appear once each, no score.\n\n- **AC**: \n  - 'A' and 'C' appear once each, no score.\n\n- **BCC**: \n  - 'B' appears once, no score.\n  - 'C' appears two times consecutively, add 3 to the score. Total score = 22.\n\n- **BB**: \n  - 'B' appears two times consecutively, add 2 to the score. Total score = 24.\n\nAfter analyzing the entire string, the final total score is 24.\n\nThe answer is: <<<24>>>"
