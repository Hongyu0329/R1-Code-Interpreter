    "To determine the total score of the given string \"CBCACCCACAABABCBCACACBBCABCACACAAAB\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n1. **Identify Consecutive Characters:**\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right and identify any consecutive occurrences of the same character.\n\n2. **Apply Scoring Rules:**\n   - If two or more consecutive 'A's are found, add 1 to the total score.\n   - If two or more consecutive 'B's are found, add 2 to the total score.\n   - If two or more consecutive 'C's are found, add 3 to the total score.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start with an initial score of 0.\n   - Scan the string \"CBCACCCACAABABCBCACACBBCABCACACAAAB\".\n\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **C**: Two consecutive C's found, add 3 to the score. Total score = 3.\n   - **C**: Already counted in the previous step.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **A**: Two consecutive A's found, add 1 to the score. Total score = 4.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **B**: Two consecutive B's found, add 2 to the score. Total score = 6.\n   - **B**: Already counted in the previous step.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's initially.\n   - **A**: No consecutive A's initially.\n   - **A**: Two consecutive A's found, add 1 to the score. Total score = 7.\n   - **A**: Already counted in the previous step.\n   - **B**: No consecutive B's initially.\n\n4. **Final Score:**\n   - After scanning the entire string, the total score is 7.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<7>>>."
