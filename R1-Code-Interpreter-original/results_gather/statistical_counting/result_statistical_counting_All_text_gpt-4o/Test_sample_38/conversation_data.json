    "To determine the total score of the string \"FACACFABCBFEACEBBDFFAAFFC\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of each letter and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **F**: No consecutive F's until the end.\n   - **A**: There are two consecutive A's at the end of the string. Add 1 to the score.\n   - **C**: No consecutive C's.\n   - **B**: There are two consecutive B's (\"BB\") in the string. Add 2 to the score.\n   - **D**: No consecutive D's.\n   - **E**: No consecutive E's.\n   - **F**: There are two consecutive F's (\"FF\") at the end of the string. Add 6 to the score.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - From the above analysis, we have:\n     - 1 point for consecutive A's.\n     - 2 points for consecutive B's.\n     - 6 points for consecutive F's.\n   - Total score = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"FACACFABCBFEACEBBDFFAAFFC\" is <<<9>>>."
