    "To determine the total score of the string \"DDCBCDBEBCABDECBCBCE\", we need to analyze the string step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of each letter and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **DD**: The first two characters are 'D' and 'D'. Since there are two consecutive 'D's, add 4 to the total score. Total score = 0 + 4 = 4.\n   - **C**: The next character is 'C'. There are no consecutive 'C's here, so no score is added.\n   - **B**: The next character is 'B'. There are no consecutive 'B's here, so no score is added.\n   - **C**: The next character is 'C'. There are no consecutive 'C's here, so no score is added.\n   - **D**: The next character is 'D'. There are no consecutive 'D's here, so no score is added.\n   - **B**: The next character is 'B'. There are no consecutive 'B's here, so no score is added.\n   - **E**: The next character is 'E'. There are no consecutive 'E's here, so no score is added.\n   - **B**: The next character is 'B'. There are no consecutive 'B's here, so no score is added.\n   - **C**: The next character is 'C'. There are no consecutive 'C's here, so no score is added.\n   - **A**: The next character is 'A'. There are no consecutive 'A's here, so no score is added.\n   - **B**: The next character is 'B'. There are no consecutive 'B's here, so no score is added.\n   - **D**: The next character is 'D'. There are no consecutive 'D's here, so no score is added.\n   - **E**: The next character is 'E'. There are no consecutive 'E's here, so no score is added.\n   - **C**: The next character is 'C'. There are no consecutive 'C's here, so no score is added.\n   - **B**: The next character is 'B'. There are no consecutive 'B's here, so no score is added.\n   - **C**: The next character is 'C'. There are no consecutive 'C's here, so no score is added.\n   - **B**: The next character is 'B'. There are no consecutive 'B's here, so no score is added.\n   - **C**: The next character is 'C'. There are no consecutive 'C's here, so no score is added.\n   - **E**: The last character is 'E'. There are no consecutive 'E's here, so no score is added.\n\n4. **Final score**: After scanning the entire string, the total score is 4.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string \"DDCBCDBEBCABDECBCBCE\" is <<<4>>>."
