    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given string \"DCDCBBABAFECDCBBCFBBFACED\" step by step, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter from A to F and updating the total score accordingly. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string**: We will go through the string character by character, looking for consecutive occurrences of each letter.\n\n3. **Check for consecutive letters**:\n   - **A**: There are no consecutive A's in the string.\n   - **B**: \n     - There are two consecutive B's at positions 4 and 5 (\"BB\"). Add 2 to the total score.\n     - There are two consecutive B's at positions 15 and 16 (\"BB\"). Add 2 to the total score.\n     - There are two consecutive B's at positions 18 and 19 (\"BB\"). Add 2 to the total score.\n   - **C**: There are no consecutive C's in the string.\n   - **D**: There are no consecutive D's in the string.\n   - **E**: There are no consecutive E's in the string.\n   - **F**: There are no consecutive F's in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**: \n   - From the consecutive B's found, we added 2 three times (once for each pair of consecutive B's).\n   - Total score = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n5. **Format the answer**: According to the problem, the answer should be formatted as <<<number>>>.\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<6>>>."
