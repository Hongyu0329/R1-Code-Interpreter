    "To determine the total score of the string \"ACCABBCCAAABBACBCCBBACCBCAABBCABAAC\", we need to analyze it step by step according to the given rules. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initialize the total score**: Start with a total score of 0.\n\n2. **Scan the string from front to back**: We will look for consecutive occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' and update the score accordingly.\n\n3. **Identify consecutive letters and update the score**:\n   - **A's**: \n     - At positions 0-1: \"ACCA\" - No consecutive A's.\n     - At positions 7-9: \"CCAAABB\" - Three consecutive A's (positions 7-9), add 1 to the score.\n     - At positions 25-26: \"CCBCAAB\" - Two consecutive A's (positions 25-26), add 1 to the score.\n     - At positions 33-34: \"ABAAC\" - Two consecutive A's (positions 33-34), add 1 to the score.\n   - **B's**:\n     - At positions 4-5: \"ABBCC\" - Two consecutive B's (positions 4-5), add 2 to the score.\n     - At positions 10-11: \"BBAC\" - Two consecutive B's (positions 10-11), add 2 to the score.\n     - At positions 17-18: \"BCCBB\" - Two consecutive B's (positions 17-18), add 2 to the score.\n     - At positions 19-20: \"CCBBAC\" - Two consecutive B's (positions 19-20), add 2 to the score.\n     - At positions 27-28: \"AABBC\" - Two consecutive B's (positions 27-28), add 2 to the score.\n   - **C's**:\n     - At positions 1-2: \"ACCABB\" - Two consecutive C's (positions 1-2), add 3 to the score.\n     - At positions 6-7: \"BBCCAA\" - Two consecutive C's (positions 6-7), add 3 to the score.\n     - At positions 15-16: \"ACBCCB\" - Two consecutive C's (positions 15-16), add 3 to the score.\n     - At positions 21-22: \"ACCBCA\" - Two consecutive C's (positions 21-22), add 3 to the score.\n\n4. **Calculate the total score**:\n   - Total score from A's: 1 (positions 7-9) + 1 (positions 25-26) + 1 (positions 33-34) = 3\n   - Total score from B's: 2 (positions 4-5) + 2 (positions 10-11) + 2 (positions 17-18) + 2 (positions 19-20) + 2 (positions 27-28) = 10\n   - Total score from C's: 3 (positions 1-2) + 3 (positions 6-7) + 3 (positions 15-16) + 3 (positions 21-22) = 12\n\n5. **Final total score**: Add up all the scores: 3 (A's) + 10 (B's) + 12 (C's) = 25\n\nTherefore, the total score of the string is <<<25>>>."
