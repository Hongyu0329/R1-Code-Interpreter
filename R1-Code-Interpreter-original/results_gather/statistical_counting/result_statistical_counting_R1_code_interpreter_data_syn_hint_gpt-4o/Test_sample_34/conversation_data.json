    "To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given string and check for consecutive occurrences of each letter from A to F.

Initialize the total score to 0.\n2. Iterate through the string, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter.\n3. For each letter, if two or more consecutive occurrences are found, add the corresponding score to the total score.\n4. Continue this process until the end of the string.\n5.
