    "To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given string and check for consecutive occurrences of each letter from A to F. Based on the rules provided, we will add the corresponding score to the total score whenever we find two or more consecutive occurrences of the same letter.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the total score to 0.\n2. Iterate through the string, checking for consecutive occurrences of each letter.\n3. If two or more consecutive occurrences are found, add the respective score to the total score.\n4. Continue this process until the end of the string.\n5. Return the total score.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_score(s):\n    total_score = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 1:\n        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:\n            if s[i] == 'A':\n                total_score += 1\n            elif s[i] == 'B':\n                total_score += 2\n            elif s[i] == 'C':\n                total_score += 3\n            elif s[i] == 'D':\n                total_score += 4\n            elif s[i] == 'E':\n                total_score += 5\n            elif s[i] == 'F':\n                total_score += 6\n            # Move the index to skip the consecutive characters\n            while i < len(s) - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]:\n                i += 1\n        i += 1\n    return total_score\n\n# Given string\ns = \"FADAADABCEBCDFBAFDFAAFFFE\"\n# Calculate and print the total score\nprint(calculate_score(s))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total score.",
