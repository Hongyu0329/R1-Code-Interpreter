    "To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given string and check for consecutive occurrences of each letter (A, B, C, D, E). For each pair of consecutive letters, we will add the corresponding score to the total score. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the total score to 0.\n2. Iterate through the string from the first character to the second-to-last character.\n3. For each character, check if it is the same as the next character.\n4. If they are the same, add the corresponding score to the total score based on the character:\n   - Add 1 for 'A'\n   - Add 2 for 'B'\n   - Add 3 for 'C'\n   - Add 4 for 'D'\n   - Add 5 for 'E'\n5. Continue this process until the end of the string.\n6. Return the total score.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_score(s):\n    total_score = 0\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1):\n        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:\n            if s[i] == 'A':\n                total_score += 1\n            elif s[i] == 'B':\n                total_score += 2\n            elif s[i] == 'C':\n                total_score += 3\n            elif s[i] == 'D':\n                total_score += 4\n            elif s[i] == 'E':\n                total_score += 5\n    return total_score\n\nstring = \"ABABACEEBEEDECDBADEC\"\nscore = calculate_score(string)\nprint(score)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total score.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned a total score of 10 for the given string \"ABABACEEBEEDECDBADEC\". \n\nThe logic correctly identified and scored the consecutive occurrences of letters according to the rules provided. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
