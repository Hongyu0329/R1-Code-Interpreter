    "To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given string and check for consecutive occurrences of each letter from A to F. For each pair of consecutive letters, we will add the corresponding score to the total score. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the total score to 0.\n2. Iterate through the string from the first character to the second-to-last character.\n3. For each character, check if it is the same as the next character.\n4. If they are the same, add the corresponding score to the total score based on the character.\n5. Continue this process until the end of the string.\n6. Return the total score.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_score(s):\n    score = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 1:\n        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:\n            if s[i] == 'A':\n                score += 1\n            elif s[i] == 'B':\n                score += 2\n            elif s[i] == 'C':\n                score += 3\n            elif s[i] == 'D':\n                score += 4\n            elif s[i] == 'E':\n                score += 5\n            elif s[i] == 'F':\n                score += 6\n            # Move to the next character after the pair\n            i += 1\n        i += 1\n    return score\n\n# Given string\ns = \"FCDDFEDEEFFBDFCEDDBEBAADC\"\n# Calculate and print the total score\nprint(calculate_score(s))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the total score based on the rules provided. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned a total score of 20 for the given string. This means that the string \"FCDDFEDEEFFBDFCEDDBEBAADC\" has a total score of 20 based on the rules provided for consecutive letters.\n\n<<<20>>>"
