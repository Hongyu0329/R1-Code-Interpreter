    "\nassistant > To calculate the total score of the string \"ABBBA\", we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the total score to 0.\n2. Iterate through the string and check for consecutive 'A's and 'B's.\n3. If two or more consecutive 'A's are found, add 1 to the total score.\n4. If two or more consecutive 'B's are found, add 2 to the total score.\n\nLet's go through the string \"ABBBA\" step by step:\n\n- The string starts with 'A', followed by three 'B's, and ends with 'A'.\n- There are no consecutive 'A's, so no points are added for 'A's.\n- There are three consecutive 'B's, so 2 points are added for 'B's.\n\nLet's calculate the total score.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef calculate_score(s):\n    score = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 1:\n        if s[i] == 'A' and s[i + 1] == 'A':\n            score += 1\n            while i < len(s) - 1 and s[i] == 'A':\n                i += 1\n        elif s[i] == 'B' and s[i + 1] == 'B':\n            score += 2\n            while i < len(s) - 1 and s[i] == 'B':\n                i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return score\n\n# Calculate the score for the string \"ABBBA\"\ntotal_score = calculate_score(\"ABBBA\")\ntotal_score\nassistant > The total score of the string \"ABBBA\" is <<<2>>>."
