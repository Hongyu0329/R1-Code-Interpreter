    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word \"synonymous\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions should be counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Iterate through each character in the word \"synonymous\".\n2. Check if the character is 'y'.\n3. If it is, record its position (considering the position starts from 1).\n4. Count the total number of 'y's found.\n\nWe can use a simple Python script to achieve this:\n\n```python\nword = \"synonymous\"\npositions = [i + 1 for i, letter in enumerate(word) if letter == 'y']\ncount = len(positions)\nprint(f\"Count: {count}, Positions: {positions}\")\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over each character in the word, check if it is 'y', and record its position. Finally, it will print the count and the positions of 'y'. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "Based on the code execution, we have determined that the letter 'y' appears twice in the word \"synonymous\" at positions 2 and 6. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [2, 6]>>>"
