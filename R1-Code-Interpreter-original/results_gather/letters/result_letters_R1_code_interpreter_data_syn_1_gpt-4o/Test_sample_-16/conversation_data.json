    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of occurrences of the letter 'g' in the given word and determine their positions. The positions should be counted starting from 1, not 0. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Check if the character is 'g'.\n3. If it is, increment the count and record the position (index + 1).\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nword = 'gudolnxldzgfsgmgxnnalfgi'\ncount = 0\npositions = []\n\nfor index, char in enumerate(word):\n    if char == 'g':\n        count += 1\n        positions.append(index + 1)\n\nprint(f\"<<<Count: {count}, Positions: {positions}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis script will output the count of 'g's and their positions in the specified format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct output. The word 'gudolnxldzgfsgmgxnnalfgi' contains 5 occurrences of the letter 'g', and their positions are 1, 11, 14, 16, and 23.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 11, 14, 16, 23]>>>"
