    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of occurrences of the letter 's' in the word 'nonexpeditiousness' and determine their positions. The positions should be counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Iterate through each character in the word.\n2. Check if the character is 's'.\n3. If it is, record its position (considering the position starts from 1).\n4. Count the total number of 's' characters.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nword = 'nonexpeditiousness'\npositions = []\n\nfor index, char in enumerate(word):\n    if char == 's':\n        positions.append(index + 1)\n\ncount = len(positions)\nprint(f\"Count: {count}, Positions: {positions}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have the results. The word 'nonexpeditiousness' contains 3 occurrences of the letter 's'. The positions of these occurrences, counting from 1, are 14, 17, and 18.\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [14, 17, 18]>>>"
