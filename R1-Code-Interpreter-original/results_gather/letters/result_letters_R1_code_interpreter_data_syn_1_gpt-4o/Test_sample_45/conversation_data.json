    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word \"nondilatability\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions should be counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of 'y's.\n2. Create a list to store the positions of 'y's.\n3. Iterate over each character in the word \"nondilatability\".\n4. If the character is 'y', increment the counter and add the position (index + 1) to the list.\n5. Return the count and the list of positions.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nword = \"nondilatability\"\ncount = 0\npositions = []\n\nfor index, char in enumerate(word):\n    if char == 'y':\n        count += 1\n        positions.append(index + 1)\n\nprint(f\"<<<Count: {count}, Positions: {positions}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will count the occurrences of 'y' and determine their positions in the word. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that there is one 'y' in the word \"nondilatability,\" located at position 15.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [15]>>>"
