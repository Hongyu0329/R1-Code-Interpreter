    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"pseudoparthenogenesis\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions should be counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Count the occurrences of the letter 'g' in the word.\n2. Find the positions of each 'g' in the word, adjusting for 1-based indexing.\n\nWe can achieve this using a simple Python script. Let's write the code to perform these tasks.\n\n```python\nword = \"pseudoparthenogenesis\"\ncount_g = word.count('g')\npositions = [i + 1 for i, letter in enumerate(word) if letter == 'g']\nprint(f\"Count: {count_g}, Positions: {positions}\")\n```\n\nThis code will count the number of 'g's and find their positions in the word. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have determined that there is one 'g' in the word \"pseudoparthenogenesis\" at position 15.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [15]>>>"
