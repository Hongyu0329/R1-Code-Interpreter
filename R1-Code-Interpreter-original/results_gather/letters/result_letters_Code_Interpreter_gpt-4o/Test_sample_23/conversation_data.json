Let's solve this manually.\n\nThe word is \"ywxzriyfyzyeb\". Let's count the 'y's and find their positions:\n\n1. y (position 1)\n2. y (position 6)\n3. y (position 8)\n4. y (position 10)\n\nSo, there are 4 'y's in the word, and their positions are 1, 6, 8, and 10.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Count: 4, Positions: [1, 6, 8, 10]>>>."
