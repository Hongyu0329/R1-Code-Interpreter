Let me calculate it manually for you.\n\nThe word \"parallelogrammatical\" contains the letter 'a' at the following positions:\n\n1. p**a**rallelogrammatical (Position 2)\n2. par**a**llelogrammatical (Position 4)\n3. parallelogr**a**mmatical (Position 11)\n4. parallelogr**a**mm**a**tical (Position 12)\n5. parallelogramm**a**tical (Position 15)\n\nSo, there are 5 occurrences of the letter 'a'.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Count: 5, Positions: [2, 4, 11, 12, 15]>>>."
