    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"synonymous\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears and at which positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"synonymous\".\n\n2. **Count the 'y's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'y' in the word. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Analyze the Word**:\n   - The word \"synonymous\" is 10 letters long.\n   - We will examine each letter in the word to find 'y'.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Position 1: 's' (not 'y')\n   - Position 2: 'y' (first occurrence of 'y')\n   - Position 3: 'n' (not 'y')\n   - Position 4: 'o' (not 'y')\n   - Position 5: 'n' (not 'y')\n   - Position 6: 'y' (second occurrence of 'y')\n   - Position 7: 'm' (not 'y')\n   - Position 8: 'o' (not 'y')\n   - Position 9: 'u' (not 'y')\n   - Position 10: 's' (not 'y')\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - The letter 'y' appears 2 times.\n   - The positions of 'y' are 2 and 6.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: We have determined the count and positions of 'y' in the word \"synonymous\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 2, Positions: [2, 6]>>>."
