    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"parallelogrammatical\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"parallelogrammatical\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'a'**: \n   - Go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'a'**:\n   - As we go through the word, note the position of each 'a'. Remember that the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - Create a list of all the positions where 'a' appears.\n\nLet's perform the analysis:\n\n- The word \"parallelogrammatical\" is 19 letters long.\n- We will examine each letter in the word:\n\n  1. p (position 1)\n  2. a (position 2) - 'a' found\n  3. r (position 3)\n  4. a (position 4) - 'a' found\n  5. l (position 5)\n  6. l (position 6)\n  7. e (position 7)\n  8. l (position 8)\n  9. o (position 9)\n  10. g (position 10)\n  11. r (position 11)\n  12. a (position 12) - 'a' found\n  13. m (position 13)\n  14. m (position 14)\n  15. a (position 15) - 'a' found\n  16. t (position 16)\n  17. i (position 17)\n  18. c (position 18)\n  19. a (position 19) - 'a' found\n\n- Total count of 'a': 5\n- Positions of 'a': [2, 4, 12, 15, 19]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [2, 4, 12, 15, 19]>>>"
