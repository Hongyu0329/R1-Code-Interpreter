    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"nondeterministically\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"nondeterministically\".\n\n2. **Count the 'm's**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'm' appears.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: As we count the 'm's, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"nondeterministically\".\n   - The letters are: n, o, n, d, e, t, e, r, m, i, n, i, s, t, i, c, a, l, l, y.\n   - Count the occurrences of 'm': \n     - The first 'm' is at position 9.\n   - There are no more 'm's in the word.\n\n5. **Count and Positions**:\n   - Total count of 'm's: 1\n   - Position of 'm': 9\n\n6. **Final Answer**: We have determined the count and positions of 'm' in the word.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 1, Positions: [9]>>>."
