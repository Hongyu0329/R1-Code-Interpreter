    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the given word and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is 'iqimmvjmoedsalxmfmljltjo'.\n\n2. **Initialize Count and Positions**: Start with a count of 0 for the letter 'm' and an empty list for positions.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Word**: Go through each character in the word, keeping track of the current position (starting from 1).\n\n4. **Check for 'm'**: For each character, check if it is 'm'. If it is, increment the count by 1 and add the current position to the list of positions.\n\n5. **Continue Until End of Word**: Repeat the process until you have checked all characters in the word.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Once the iteration is complete, output the total count of 'm's and the list of positions where 'm' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word 'iqimmvjmoedsalxmfmljltjo':\n\n- The word is 25 characters long.\n- We will check each character one by one:\n\n  - Position 1: 'i' (not 'm')\n  - Position 2: 'q' (not 'm')\n  - Position 3: 'i' (not 'm')\n  - Position 4: 'm' (count = 1, positions = [4])\n  - Position 5: 'm' (count = 2, positions = [4, 5])\n  - Position 6: 'v' (not 'm')\n  - Position 7: 'j' (not 'm')\n  - Position 8: 'm' (count = 3, positions = [4, 5, 8])\n  - Position 9: 'o' (not 'm')\n  - Position 10: 'e' (not 'm')\n  - Position 11: 'd' (not 'm')\n  - Position 12: 's' (not 'm')\n  - Position 13: 'a' (not 'm')\n  - Position 14: 'l' (not 'm')\n  - Position 15: 'x' (not 'm')\n  - Position 16: 'm' (count = 4, positions = [4, 5, 8, 16])\n  - Position 17: 'f' (not 'm')\n  - Position 18: 'm' (count = 5, positions = [4, 5, 8, 16, 18])\n  - Position 19: 'l' (not 'm')\n  - Position 20: 'j' (not 'm')\n  - Position 21: 'l' (not 'm')\n  - Position 22: 't' (not 'm')\n  - Position 23: 'j' (not 'm')\n  - Position 24: 'o' (not 'm')\n\n- After checking all positions, we find that 'm' appears 5 times at positions [4, 5, 8, 16, 18].\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [4, 5, 8, 16, 18]>>>"
