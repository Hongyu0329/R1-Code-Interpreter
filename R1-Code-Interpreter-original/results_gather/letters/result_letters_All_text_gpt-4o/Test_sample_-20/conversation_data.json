    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"pseudoparthenogenesis\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"pseudoparthenogenesis\".\n\n2. **Count occurrences of 'g'**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine positions of 'g'**: As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions where 'g' appears. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **Iterate through the word**: \n   - Start from the first letter and move to the last.\n   - Keep a counter for the number of 'g's found.\n   - Keep a list to store the positions of each 'g'.\n\n5. **Perform the analysis**:\n   - The word \"pseudoparthenogenesis\" is 20 letters long.\n   - As we iterate through the word, we find that 'g' appears once.\n   - The position of 'g' in the word is 15.\n\n6. **Compile the results**:\n   - Total count of 'g': 1\n   - Position of 'g': 15\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [15]>>>"
