    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"mammatocumulus\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"mammatocumulus\".\n\n2. **Count the 'm's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'm' in the word. Note that the positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"mammatocumulus\".\n   - Check if the letter is 'm'.\n   - If it is 'm', note the position.\n\n5. **Word Analysis**:\n   - The word \"mammatocumulus\" is 14 letters long.\n   - Let's go through each letter:\n     - Position 1: 'm' (Yes, it's an 'm')\n     - Position 2: 'a'\n     - Position 3: 'm' (Yes, it's an 'm')\n     - Position 4: 'm' (Yes, it's an 'm')\n     - Position 5: 'a'\n     - Position 6: 't'\n     - Position 7: 'o'\n     - Position 8: 'c'\n     - Position 9: 'u'\n     - Position 10: 'm' (Yes, it's an 'm')\n     - Position 11: 'u'\n     - Position 12: 'l'\n     - Position 13: 'u'\n     - Position 14: 's'\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - Total 'm's found: 4\n   - Positions of 'm's: 1, 3, 4, 10\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - Count of 'm's: 4\n   - Positions: [1, 3, 4, 10]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [1, 3, 4, 10]>>>"
