    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word \"cholecystoduodenostomy\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"cholecystoduodenostomy\".\n\n2. **Count the 'y's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'y' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"cholecystoduodenostomy\".\n   - Keep a count of how many 'y's are found.\n   - Record the position of each 'y'.\n\n5. **Word Analysis**:\n   - The word is \"cholecystoduodenostomy\".\n   - Let's go through each letter:\n     - c (1)\n     - h (2)\n     - o (3)\n     - l (4)\n     - e (5)\n     - c (6)\n     - y (7) -> First 'y' found at position 7\n     - s (8)\n     - t (9)\n     - o (10)\n     - d (11)\n     - u (12)\n     - o (13)\n     - d (14)\n     - e (15)\n     - n (16)\n     - o (17)\n     - s (18)\n     - t (19)\n     - o (20)\n     - m (21)\n     - y (22) -> Second 'y' found at position 22\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - Total 'y's found: 2\n   - Positions of 'y's: 7 and 22\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - Count of 'y's: 2\n   - Positions: [7, 22]\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [7, 22]>>>"
