    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"undistinguishableness\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"undistinguishableness\".\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences of 'a'**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions**: As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions of each 'a'. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"undistinguishableness\".\n   - Check if the letter is 'a'.\n   - If it is 'a', note the position.\n   - Continue this process until the end of the word.\n\n5. **Word Analysis**:\n   - The word \"undistinguishableness\" is 19 letters long.\n   - As we go through the word, we find that 'a' appears once.\n   - The position of 'a' is 14.\n\n6. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Total Count of 'a': 1\n   - Position of 'a': 14\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [14]>>>"
