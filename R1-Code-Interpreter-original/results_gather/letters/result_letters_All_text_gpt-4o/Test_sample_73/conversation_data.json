    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of occurrences of the letter 'y' in the given word and the positions of these occurrences. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is 'zgmztnywyyovhlcdhindy'.\n\n2. **Count the 'y's**: We need to go through each character in the word and count how many times 'y' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions**: As we count the 'y's, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Word**: We will go through each character in the word one by one:\n\n   - Position 1: 'z' (not 'y')\n   - Position 2: 'g' (not 'y')\n   - Position 3: 'm' (not 'y')\n   - Position 4: 'z' (not 'y')\n   - Position 5: 't' (not 'y')\n   - Position 6: 'n' (not 'y')\n   - Position 7: 'y' (first 'y', position 7)\n   - Position 8: 'w' (not 'y')\n   - Position 9: 'y' (second 'y', position 9)\n   - Position 10: 'y' (third 'y', position 10)\n   - Position 11: 'o' (not 'y')\n   - Position 12: 'v' (not 'y')\n   - Position 13: 'h' (not 'y')\n   - Position 14: 'l' (not 'y')\n   - Position 15: 'c' (not 'y')\n   - Position 16: 'd' (not 'y')\n   - Position 17: 'h' (not 'y')\n   - Position 18: 'i' (not 'y')\n   - Position 19: 'n' (not 'y')\n   - Position 20: 'd' (not 'y')\n   - Position 21: 'y' (fourth 'y', position 21)\n\n5. **Count and List Positions**: We found four 'y's at positions 7, 9, 10, and 21.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: According to the required format, we need to present the count and positions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [7, 9, 10, 21]>>>"
