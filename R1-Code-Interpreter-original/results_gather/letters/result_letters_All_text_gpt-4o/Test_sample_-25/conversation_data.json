    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"undistinguishableness\" and the positions of each occurrence of 'a'. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"undistinguishableness\".\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences of 'a'**:\n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions of 'a'**:\n   - As we go through the word, we should note the position of each 'a'. \n   - Remember that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Analyze the Word**:\n   - The word \"undistinguishableness\" is 19 letters long.\n   - We will examine each letter one by one.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Position 1: 'u' (not 'a')\n   - Position 2: 'n' (not 'a')\n   - Position 3: 'd' (not 'a')\n   - Position 4: 'i' (not 'a')\n   - Position 5: 's' (not 'a')\n   - Position 6: 't' (not 'a')\n   - Position 7: 'i' (not 'a')\n   - Position 8: 'n' (not 'a')\n   - Position 9: 'g' (not 'a')\n   - Position 10: 'u' (not 'a')\n   - Position 11: 'i' (not 'a')\n   - Position 12: 's' (not 'a')\n   - Position 13: 'h' (not 'a')\n   - Position 14: 'a' (this is 'a', so we note this position)\n   - Position 15: 'b' (not 'a')\n   - Position 16: 'l' (not 'a')\n   - Position 17: 'e' (not 'a')\n   - Position 18: 'n' (not 'a')\n   - Position 19: 'e' (not 'a')\n   - Position 20: 's' (not 'a')\n   - Position 21: 's' (not 'a')\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is 1 occurrence of 'a' in the word \"undistinguishableness\".\n   - The position of 'a' is 14.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [14]>>>"
