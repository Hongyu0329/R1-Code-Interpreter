    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the given word and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is 'rmzfrwkdjocilzylmvmgayms'.\n\n2. **Initialize Count and Positions**: \n   - Start with a count of 0 for the letter 'm'.\n   - Create an empty list to store the positions of 'm'.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Word**:\n   - Go through each character in the word one by one.\n   - Keep track of the current position, starting from 1.\n\n4. **Check for 'm'**:\n   - For each character, check if it is 'm'.\n   - If it is 'm', increase the count by 1.\n   - Record the current position in the list of positions.\n\n5. **Continue Until End of Word**:\n   - Repeat the process for each character until the end of the word is reached.\n\n6. **Compile Results**:\n   - After iterating through the entire word, compile the total count of 'm's and the list of positions where 'm' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word 'rmzfrwkdjocilzylmvmgayms':\n\n- The word has 24 characters.\n- We will check each character:\n\n  1. 'r' (position 1) - not 'm'\n  2. 'm' (position 2) - 'm' found, count = 1, positions = [2]\n  3. 'z' (position 3) - not 'm'\n  4. 'f' (position 4) - not 'm'\n  5. 'r' (position 5) - not 'm'\n  6. 'w' (position 6) - not 'm'\n  7. 'k' (position 7) - not 'm'\n  8. 'd' (position 8) - not 'm'\n  9. 'j' (position 9) - not 'm'\n  10. 'o' (position 10) - not 'm'\n  11. 'c' (position 11) - not 'm'\n  12. 'i' (position 12) - not 'm'\n  13. 'l' (position 13) - not 'm'\n  14. 'z' (position 14) - not 'm'\n  15. 'y' (position 15) - not 'm'\n  16. 'l' (position 16) - not 'm'\n  17. 'm' (position 17) - 'm' found, count = 2, positions = [2, 17]\n  18. 'v' (position 18) - not 'm'\n  19. 'm' (position 19) - 'm' found, count = 3, positions = [2, 17, 19]\n  20. 'g' (position 20) - not 'm'\n  21. 'a' (position 21) - not 'm'\n  22. 'y' (position 22) - not 'm'\n  23. 'm' (position 23) - 'm' found, count = 4, positions = [2, 17, 19, 23]\n  24. 's' (position 24) - not 'm'\n\n- The final count of 'm' is 4.\n- The positions where 'm' appears are [2, 17, 19, 23].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [2, 17, 19, 23]>>>"
