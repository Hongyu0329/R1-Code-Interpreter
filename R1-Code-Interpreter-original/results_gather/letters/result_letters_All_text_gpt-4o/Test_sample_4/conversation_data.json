    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"abracadabra\" and the positions of each occurrence of 'a'. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"abracadabra\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'a'**:\n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'a'**:\n   - As we go through the word, we need to note the position of each 'a'. Remember, positions start from 1.\n\n4. **Go through the word \"abracadabra\"**:\n   - Position 1: 'a' (count = 1, position = 1)\n   - Position 2: 'b' (not 'a')\n   - Position 3: 'r' (not 'a')\n   - Position 4: 'a' (count = 2, position = 4)\n   - Position 5: 'c' (not 'a')\n   - Position 6: 'a' (count = 3, position = 6)\n   - Position 7: 'd' (not 'a')\n   - Position 8: 'a' (count = 4, position = 8)\n   - Position 9: 'b' (not 'a')\n   - Position 10: 'r' (not 'a')\n   - Position 11: 'a' (count = 5, position = 11)\n\n5. **Compile the results**:\n   - Total count of 'a': 5\n   - Positions of 'a': [1, 4, 6, 8, 11]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 4, 6, 8, 11]>>>"
