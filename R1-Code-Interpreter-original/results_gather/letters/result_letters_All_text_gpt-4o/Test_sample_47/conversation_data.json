    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"cryptanalytically\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears and at which positions. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"cryptanalytically\".\n\n2. **Understand the task**: We need to count the occurrences of the letter 'y' and find their positions in the word. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n3. **Scan the word**: We will go through each letter in the word \"cryptanalytically\" and note the positions where 'y' appears.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - The first 'y' is at position 2.\n   - The second 'y' is at position 12.\n   - The third 'y' is at position 16.\n\n5. **Count the occurrences**: There are three 'y's in the word.\n\n6. **Compile the results**: We have found 3 occurrences of 'y' at positions 2, 12, and 16.\n\nNow, we can present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [2, 12, 16]>>>"
