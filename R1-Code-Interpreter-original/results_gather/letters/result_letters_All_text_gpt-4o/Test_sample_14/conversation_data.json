    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"mqkmpmmcqukmklo\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"mqkmpmmcqukmklo\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'm'**: \n   - Start from the first character and move to the last, checking each character to see if it is 'm'.\n   - Keep a count of how many 'm's are found.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'm'**:\n   - As you check each character, note the position (starting from 1) whenever an 'm' is found.\n   - Store these positions in a list.\n\n4. **Perform the analysis**:\n   - The word is \"mqkmpmmcqukmklo\".\n   - Check each character:\n     - Position 1: 'm' (count = 1, position = 1)\n     - Position 2: 'q' (not 'm')\n     - Position 3: 'k' (not 'm')\n     - Position 4: 'm' (count = 2, position = 4)\n     - Position 5: 'p' (not 'm')\n     - Position 6: 'm' (count = 3, position = 6)\n     - Position 7: 'm' (count = 4, position = 7)\n     - Position 8: 'c' (not 'm')\n     - Position 9: 'q' (not 'm')\n     - Position 10: 'u' (not 'm')\n     - Position 11: 'k' (not 'm')\n     - Position 12: 'm' (count = 5, position = 12)\n     - Position 13: 'k' (not 'm')\n     - Position 14: 'l' (not 'm')\n     - Position 15: 'o' (not 'm')\n\n5. **Compile the results**:\n   - Total count of 'm': 5\n   - Positions of 'm': [1, 4, 6, 7, 12]\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 4, 6, 7, 12]>>>"
