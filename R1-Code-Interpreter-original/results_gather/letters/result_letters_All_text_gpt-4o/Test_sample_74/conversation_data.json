    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of occurrences of the letter 'y' in the given word and the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"ybywqyqttohdyyeqbldkren\".\n\n2. **Initialize Counters**: \n   - A counter to keep track of the number of 'y's found.\n   - A list to store the positions of each 'y'.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Word**:\n   - Start from the first character and move to the last.\n   - For each character, check if it is 'y'.\n   - If it is 'y', increment the counter and record the position.\n\n4. **Position Counting**: \n   - Remember that positions start from 1, not 0. So, when recording the position, add 1 to the index of the character.\n\n5. **List the Positions**:\n   - As you find each 'y', append its position to the list.\n\n6. **Count the 'y's**:\n   - The counter will give the total number of 'y's in the word.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"ybywqyqttohdyyeqbldkren\":\n\n- The word is 23 characters long.\n- We will check each character one by one:\n\n  1. 'y' at position 1\n  2. 'b' at position 2\n  3. 'y' at position 3\n  4. 'w' at position 4\n  5. 'q' at position 5\n  6. 'y' at position 6\n  7. 'q' at position 7\n  8. 't' at position 8\n  9. 't' at position 9\n  10. 'o' at position 10\n  11. 'h' at position 11\n  12. 'd' at position 12\n  13. 'y' at position 13\n  14. 'y' at position 14\n  15. 'e' at position 15\n  16. 'q' at position 16\n  17. 'b' at position 17\n  18. 'l' at position 18\n  19. 'd' at position 19\n  20. 'k' at position 20\n  21. 'r' at position 21\n  22. 'e' at position 22\n  23. 'n' at position 23\n\n- The positions of 'y' are: 1, 3, 6, 13, 14.\n\n- The total count of 'y' is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 3, 6, 13, 14]>>>"
