    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"gudolnxldzgfsgmgxnnalfgi\" and determine how many times the letter 'g' appears and at which positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Task**: We need to count the occurrences of the letter 'g' and find their positions in the given word.\n\n2. **Understand the Positioning**: The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0. This means the first letter of the word is at position 1, the second letter is at position 2, and so on.\n\n3. **Examine the Word**: The word provided is \"gudolnxldzgfsgmgxnnalfgi\".\n\n4. **Scan the Word**: We will go through each letter in the word and check if it is 'g'. If it is, we will note the position.\n\n5. **Count and Record Positions**:\n   - Position 1: 'g' (Count = 1)\n   - Position 11: 'g' (Count = 2)\n   - Position 14: 'g' (Count = 3)\n   - Position 16: 'g' (Count = 4)\n   - Position 25: 'g' (Count = 5)\n\n6. **Compile the Results**: We have found 5 occurrences of 'g' at positions 1, 11, 14, 16, and 25.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: According to the required format, we need to present the count and positions in a specific way.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 11, 14, 16, 25]>>>"
