    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"professoress\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"professoress\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 's'**: \n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 's' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 's'**:\n   - As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions of each 's'. \n   - Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - As we identify each 's', we record its position in the word.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"professoress\":\n\n- The word \"professoress\" is 12 letters long.\n- We will examine each letter:\n\n  1. p (position 1)\n  2. r (position 2)\n  3. o (position 3)\n  4. f (position 4)\n  5. e (position 5)\n  6. s (position 6) - First 's'\n  7. s (position 7) - Second 's'\n  8. o (position 8)\n  9. r (position 9)\n  10. e (position 10)\n  11. s (position 11) - Third 's'\n  12. s (position 12) - Fourth 's'\n\n- We found four 's's in the word.\n- The positions of 's' are 6, 7, 11, and 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [6, 7, 11, 12]>>>"
