    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"pseudoparthenogenesis\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"pseudoparthenogenesis\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'g'**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'g'**: As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions where 'g' appears. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**: After identifying the positions, we will list them in order.\n\nLet's perform the analysis:\n\n- The word \"pseudoparthenogenesis\" is 20 letters long.\n- We will examine each letter in the word:\n\n  1. p\n  2. s\n  3. e\n  4. u\n  5. d\n  6. o\n  7. p\n  8. a\n  9. r\n  10. t\n  11. h\n  12. e\n  13. n\n  14. o\n  15. g (Position 15)\n  16. e\n  17. n\n  18. e\n  19. s\n  20. i\n  21. s\n\n- We find that 'g' appears once in the word, at position 15.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [15]>>>"
