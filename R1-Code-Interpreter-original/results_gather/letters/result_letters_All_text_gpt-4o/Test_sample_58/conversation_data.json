    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of occurrences of the letter 'g' in the given word and the positions of these occurrences. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word provided is 'bmmgtjgzorlbgkwvroerqhkg'.\n\n2. **Initialize Counters**: \n   - A counter to keep track of the number of 'g's found.\n   - A list to store the positions of each 'g'.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Word**: \n   - Start from the first character and move to the last.\n   - For each character, check if it is 'g'.\n\n4. **Count and Record Positions**:\n   - If a character is 'g', increment the counter.\n   - Record the position of 'g'. Remember, positions start from 1, not 0.\n\n5. **List the Positions**: \n   - As you find each 'g', note its position in the list.\n\n6. **Final Count and Positions**:\n   - After iterating through the entire word, you will have the total count of 'g's and their respective positions.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word 'bmmgtjgzorlbgkwvroerqhkg':\n\n- The word is 25 characters long.\n- We will check each character one by one.\n\n   - Position 1: 'b' (not 'g')\n   - Position 2: 'm' (not 'g')\n   - Position 3: 'm' (not 'g')\n   - Position 4: 'g' (is 'g', count = 1, position = 4)\n   - Position 5: 't' (not 'g')\n   - Position 6: 'j' (not 'g')\n   - Position 7: 'g' (is 'g', count = 2, position = 7)\n   - Position 8: 'z' (not 'g')\n   - Position 9: 'o' (not 'g')\n   - Position 10: 'r' (not 'g')\n   - Position 11: 'l' (not 'g')\n   - Position 12: 'b' (not 'g')\n   - Position 13: 'g' (is 'g', count = 3, position = 13)\n   - Position 14: 'k' (not 'g')\n   - Position 15: 'w' (not 'g')\n   - Position 16: 'v' (not 'g')\n   - Position 17: 'r' (not 'g')\n   - Position 18: 'o' (not 'g')\n   - Position 19: 'e' (not 'g')\n   - Position 20: 'r' (not 'g')\n   - Position 21: 'q' (not 'g')\n   - Position 22: 'h' (not 'g')\n   - Position 23: 'k' (not 'g')\n   - Position 24: 'g' (is 'g', count = 4, position = 24)\n\n- Total 'g's found: 4\n- Positions of 'g's: [4, 7, 13, 24]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [4, 7, 13, 24]>>>"
