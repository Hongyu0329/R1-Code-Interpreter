    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"mhgluqmszqgmyblryyym\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears and at which positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Task**: We need to count the occurrences of the letter 'y' and find their positions in the word.\n\n2. **Understand the Positioning**: The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0. This means the first letter of the word is at position 1, the second letter is at position 2, and so on.\n\n3. **Examine the Word**: The word given is \"mhgluqmszqgmyblryyym\".\n\n4. **Scan the Word**: We will go through each letter in the word and check if it is 'y'. If it is, we will note its position.\n\n5. **Count and Record Positions**:\n   - Position 1: 'm' (not 'y')\n   - Position 2: 'h' (not 'y')\n   - Position 3: 'g' (not 'y')\n   - Position 4: 'l' (not 'y')\n   - Position 5: 'u' (not 'y')\n   - Position 6: 'q' (not 'y')\n   - Position 7: 'm' (not 'y')\n   - Position 8: 's' (not 'y')\n   - Position 9: 'z' (not 'y')\n   - Position 10: 'q' (not 'y')\n   - Position 11: 'g' (not 'y')\n   - Position 12: 'm' (not 'y')\n   - Position 13: 'y' (is 'y', record position 13)\n   - Position 14: 'b' (not 'y')\n   - Position 15: 'l' (not 'y')\n   - Position 16: 'r' (not 'y')\n   - Position 17: 'y' (is 'y', record position 17)\n   - Position 18: 'y' (is 'y', record position 18)\n   - Position 19: 'y' (is 'y', record position 19)\n   - Position 20: 'm' (not 'y')\n\n6. **Count the 'y's**: We found 'y' at positions 13, 17, 18, and 19. This means there are 4 occurrences of 'y'.\n\n7. **Compile the Results**: We have counted 4 'y's and their positions are 13, 17, 18, and 19.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [13, 17, 18, 19]>>>"
