    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"hypohypophysism\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears and at which positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"hypohypophysism\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to count the occurrences of the letter 'y' and find their positions in the word. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n3. **Scan the Word**: We will go through each letter in the word and check if it is 'y'. If it is, we will note its position.\n\n4. **Count the 'y's**: As we scan, we will keep a count of how many 'y's we encounter.\n\n5. **Record the Positions**: For each 'y' found, we will record its position in the word.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"hypohypophysism\":\n\n- **Position 1**: 'h' (not 'y')\n- **Position 2**: 'y' (first 'y' found, position 2)\n- **Position 3**: 'p' (not 'y')\n- **Position 4**: 'o' (not 'y')\n- **Position 5**: 'h' (not 'y')\n- **Position 6**: 'y' (second 'y' found, position 6)\n- **Position 7**: 'p' (not 'y')\n- **Position 8**: 'o' (not 'y')\n- **Position 9**: 'p' (not 'y')\n- **Position 10**: 'h' (not 'y')\n- **Position 11**: 'y' (third 'y' found, position 11)\n- **Position 12**: 's' (not 'y')\n- **Position 13**: 'i' (not 'y')\n- **Position 14**: 's' (not 'y')\n- **Position 15**: 'm' (not 'y')\n\n**Count of 'y's**: 3\n\n**Positions of 'y's**: [2, 6, 11]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [2, 6, 11]>>>"
