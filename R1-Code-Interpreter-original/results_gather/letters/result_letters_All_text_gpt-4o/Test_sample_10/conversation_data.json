    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"coumarilic\" and determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in it, as well as the positions of each occurrence. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"coumarilic\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to find:\n   - The number of times the letter 'm' appears in the word.\n   - The positions of each 'm' in the word, with the position count starting from 1.\n\n3. **Examine Each Character**: We will go through each character in the word \"coumarilic\" and check if it is 'm'. We will also keep track of the position of each character.\n\n4. **Count and Record Positions**:\n   - Start with the first character and move to the last.\n   - If a character is 'm', increase the count by 1 and record the position.\n\n5. **Perform the Analysis**:\n   - The word \"coumarilic\" is 10 characters long.\n   - Check each character:\n     - Position 1: 'c' (not 'm')\n     - Position 2: 'o' (not 'm')\n     - Position 3: 'u' (not 'm')\n     - Position 4: 'm' (is 'm', count = 1, position = 4)\n     - Position 5: 'a' (not 'm')\n     - Position 6: 'r' (not 'm')\n     - Position 7: 'i' (not 'm')\n     - Position 8: 'l' (not 'm')\n     - Position 9: 'i' (not 'm')\n     - Position 10: 'c' (not 'm')\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The letter 'm' appears 1 time in the word \"coumarilic\".\n   - The position of 'm' is 4.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [4]>>>"
