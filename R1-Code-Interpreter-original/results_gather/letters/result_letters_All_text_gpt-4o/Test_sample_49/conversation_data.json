    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of 'y's in the word \"cqkuyeyyyddkxizkxvyc\" and their positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"cqkuyeyyyddkxizkxvyc\".\n\n2. **Count the 'y's**: We need to go through each character in the word and count how many times the letter 'y' appears.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: As we count the 'y's, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Word**: \n   - Start from the first character and move to the last.\n   - For each character, check if it is 'y'.\n   - If it is 'y', increase the count by 1 and record the position.\n\n5. **List the Positions**: Collect all the positions where 'y' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"cqkuyeyyyddkxizkxvyc\":\n\n- The word is 19 characters long.\n- We will check each character one by one:\n\n  1. c (position 1) - not 'y'\n  2. q (position 2) - not 'y'\n  3. k (position 3) - not 'y'\n  4. u (position 4) - not 'y'\n  5. y (position 5) - 'y' found, count = 1, position = 5\n  6. e (position 6) - not 'y'\n  7. y (position 7) - 'y' found, count = 2, position = 7\n  8. y (position 8) - 'y' found, count = 3, position = 8\n  9. y (position 9) - 'y' found, count = 4, position = 9\n  10. d (position 10) - not 'y'\n  11. d (position 11) - not 'y'\n  12. k (position 12) - not 'y'\n  13. x (position 13) - not 'y'\n  14. i (position 14) - not 'y'\n  15. z (position 15) - not 'y'\n  16. k (position 16) - not 'y'\n  17. v (position 17) - not 'y'\n  18. y (position 18) - 'y' found, count = 5, position = 18\n  19. c (position 19) - not 'y'\n\n- Total 'y's found: 5\n- Positions of 'y's: [5, 7, 8, 9, 18]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [5, 7, 8, 9, 18]>>>"
