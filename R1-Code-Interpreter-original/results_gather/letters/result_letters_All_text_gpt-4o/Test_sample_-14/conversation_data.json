    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"anemometrographically\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"anemometrographically\".\n\n2. **Count the 'm's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'm' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"anemometrographically\".\n   - Keep a count of how many 'm's are encountered.\n   - Record the position of each 'm'.\n\n5. **Word Analysis**:\n   - The word is \"anemometrographically\".\n   - Let's go through each letter:\n     - a (1)\n     - n (2)\n     - e (3)\n     - m (4) → First 'm' at position 4\n     - o (5)\n     - m (6) → Second 'm' at position 6\n     - e (7)\n     - t (8)\n     - r (9)\n     - o (10)\n     - g (11)\n     - r (12)\n     - a (13)\n     - p (14)\n     - h (15)\n     - i (16)\n     - c (17)\n     - a (18)\n     - l (19)\n     - l (20)\n     - y (21)\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - Total 'm's: 2\n   - Positions of 'm's: 4 and 6\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - Count of 'm's: 2\n   - Positions: [4, 6]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [4, 6]>>>"
