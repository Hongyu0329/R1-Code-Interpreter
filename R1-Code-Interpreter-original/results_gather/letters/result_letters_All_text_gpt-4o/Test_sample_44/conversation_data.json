    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"nonsuccessiveness\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"nonsuccessiveness\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 's'**: \n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 's' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 's'**:\n   - As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the position of each 's'. \n   - Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - As we identify each 's', we record its position in a list.\n\nLet's go through the word \"nonsuccessiveness\":\n\n- Position 1: 'n' (not 's')\n- Position 2: 'o' (not 's')\n- Position 3: 'n' (not 's')\n- Position 4: 's' (first 's')\n- Position 5: 'u' (not 's')\n- Position 6: 'c' (not 's')\n- Position 7: 'c' (not 's')\n- Position 8: 'e' (not 's')\n- Position 9: 's' (second 's')\n- Position 10: 's' (third 's')\n- Position 11: 'i' (not 's')\n- Position 12: 'v' (not 's')\n- Position 13: 'e' (not 's')\n- Position 14: 'n' (not 's')\n- Position 15: 'e' (not 's')\n- Position 16: 's' (fourth 's')\n- Position 17: 's' (fifth 's')\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that there are 5 occurrences of 's' in the word \"nonsuccessiveness\". The positions of 's' are 4, 9, 10, 16, and 17.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [4, 9, 10, 16, 17]>>>"
