    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"anemometrographically\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"anemometrographically\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'm'**: \n   - Go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'm' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'm'**:\n   - As we count each 'm', note its position in the word. Remember, the position starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - Create a list of all the positions where 'm' appears.\n\n5. **Output the result**:\n   - Format the result to show the count of 'm's and their positions.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the word \"anemometrographically\":\n\n- The word is \"anemometrographically\".\n- Count the 'm's: \n  - The first 'm' is at position 4.\n  - The second 'm' is at position 6.\n- Total count of 'm's: 2.\n- Positions of 'm's: [4, 6].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [4, 6]>>>"
