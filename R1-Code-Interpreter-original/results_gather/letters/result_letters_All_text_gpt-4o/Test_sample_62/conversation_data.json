    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the word \"mbxxoatfbjtfpndbkyssmm\" and determine how many times the letter 'm' appears and at which positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Task**: We need to count the occurrences of the letter 'm' and find their positions in the given word.\n\n2. **Understand the Indexing**: The positions in the word are counted starting from 1, not 0. This means the first character of the word is at position 1.\n\n3. **Examine the Word**: The word given is \"mbxxoatfbjtfpndbkyssmm\".\n\n4. **Count the 'm's**: We will go through each character in the word and count how many times 'm' appears.\n\n5. **Determine the Positions**: As we count the 'm's, we will also note the positions where each 'm' appears.\n\n6. **Perform the Analysis**:\n   - The first character is 'm' (position 1).\n   - The second character is 'b'.\n   - The third character is 'x'.\n   - The fourth character is 'x'.\n   - The fifth character is 'o'.\n   - The sixth character is 'a'.\n   - The seventh character is 't'.\n   - The eighth character is 'f'.\n   - The ninth character is 'b'.\n   - The tenth character is 'j'.\n   - The eleventh character is 't'.\n   - The twelfth character is 'f'.\n   - The thirteenth character is 'p'.\n   - The fourteenth character is 'n'.\n   - The fifteenth character is 'd'.\n   - The sixteenth character is 'b'.\n   - The seventeenth character is 'k'.\n   - The eighteenth character is 'y'.\n   - The nineteenth character is 's'.\n   - The twentieth character is 's'.\n   - The twenty-first character is 'm' (position 21).\n   - The twenty-second character is 'm' (position 22).\n\n7. **Count and List Positions**:\n   - Total 'm's found: 3\n   - Positions of 'm's: 1, 21, 22\n\n8. **Compile the Answer**: We have found 3 'm's at positions 1, 21, and 22.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 3, Positions: [1, 21, 22]>>>."
