    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of occurrences of the letter 'g' in the word \"gnhhakwsawgqvgcfnjgu\" and the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"gnhhakwsawgqvgcfnjgu\".\n\n2. **Count the 'g's**: We need to go through each character in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: As we count the 'g's, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Word**: We will go through each character in the word one by one:\n   - Position 1: 'g' (count = 1, position = 1)\n   - Position 2: 'n'\n   - Position 3: 'h'\n   - Position 4: 'h'\n   - Position 5: 'a'\n   - Position 6: 'k'\n   - Position 7: 'w'\n   - Position 8: 's'\n   - Position 9: 'a'\n   - Position 10: 'w'\n   - Position 11: 'g' (count = 2, position = 11)\n   - Position 12: 'q'\n   - Position 13: 'v'\n   - Position 14: 'g' (count = 3, position = 14)\n   - Position 15: 'c'\n   - Position 16: 'f'\n   - Position 17: 'n'\n   - Position 18: 'j'\n   - Position 19: 'g' (count = 4, position = 19)\n   - Position 20: 'u'\n\n5. **Compile Results**: After iterating through the word, we have found 4 occurrences of 'g'. The positions are 1, 11, 14, and 19.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: According to the required format, we need to present the count and positions in a specific way.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [1, 11, 14, 19]>>>"
