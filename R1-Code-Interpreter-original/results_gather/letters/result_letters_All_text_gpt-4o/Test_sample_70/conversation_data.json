    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"tychoparthenogenesis\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in it, as well as the positions of each occurrence. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"tychoparthenogenesis\".\n\n2. **Locate the Letter 'y'**: We need to find all occurrences of the letter 'y' in the word.\n\n3. **Count the Occurrences**: As we locate each 'y', we will keep a count of how many times it appears.\n\n4. **Determine the Positions**: For each 'y' found, we will note its position in the word. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n5. **List the Positions**: We will list all the positions where 'y' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"tychoparthenogenesis\":\n\n- The word is \"tychoparthenogenesis\".\n- We scan the word from left to right:\n  - The first letter is 't' (position 1).\n  - The second letter is 'y' (position 2).\n  - Continue scanning the rest of the word, and no other 'y' is found.\n\n6. **Count the 'y's**: We found 1 occurrence of 'y'.\n\n7. **Record the Position**: The position of 'y' is 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [2]>>>"
