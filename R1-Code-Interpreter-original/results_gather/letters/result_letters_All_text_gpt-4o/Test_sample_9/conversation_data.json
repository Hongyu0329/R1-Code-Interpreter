    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"gglgxdygmywg\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nLet's analyze the word step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: \"gglgxdygmywg\"\n2. **Initialize a counter**: Start with a count of 0 for the letter 'g'.\n3. **Initialize a list for positions**: Start with an empty list to store the positions of 'g'.\n4. **Iterate through each character in the word**:\n   - **Position 1**: The character is 'g'. Increment the count to 1 and add position 1 to the list.\n   - **Position 2**: The character is 'g'. Increment the count to 2 and add position 2 to the list.\n   - **Position 3**: The character is 'l'. No change in count or positions.\n   - **Position 4**: The character is 'g'. Increment the count to 3 and add position 4 to the list.\n   - **Position 5**: The character is 'x'. No change in count or positions.\n   - **Position 6**: The character is 'd'. No change in count or positions.\n   - **Position 7**: The character is 'y'. No change in count or positions.\n   - **Position 8**: The character is 'g'. Increment the count to 4 and add position 8 to the list.\n   - **Position 9**: The character is 'm'. No change in count or positions.\n   - **Position 10**: The character is 'y'. No change in count or positions.\n   - **Position 11**: The character is 'w'. No change in count or positions.\n   - **Position 12**: The character is 'g'. Increment the count to 5 and add position 12 to the list.\n\n5. **Final count and positions**:\n   - Total count of 'g': 5\n   - Positions of 'g': [1, 2, 4, 8, 12]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 2, 4, 8, 12]>>>"
