    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the given word and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word provided is 'iqimmvjmoedsalxmfmljltjo'.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences of 'm'**: We need to go through each character in the word and count how many times 'm' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions**: As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions of each 'm'. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Word**: We will go through each character in the word, check if it is 'm', and if so, record its position.\n\n5. **Compile the Results**: After iterating through the word, we will have the total count of 'm's and a list of their positions.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word 'iqimmvjmoedsalxmfmljltjo':\n\n- The word is 24 characters long.\n- We will check each character one by one:\n\n  - Position 1: 'i' (not 'm')\n  - Position 2: 'q' (not 'm')\n  - Position 3: 'i' (not 'm')\n  - Position 4: 'm' (first 'm', position 4)\n  - Position 5: 'm' (second 'm', position 5)\n  - Position 6: 'v' (not 'm')\n  - Position 7: 'j' (not 'm')\n  - Position 8: 'm' (third 'm', position 8)\n  - Position 9: 'o' (not 'm')\n  - Position 10: 'e' (not 'm')\n  - Position 11: 'd' (not 'm')\n  - Position 12: 's' (not 'm')\n  - Position 13: 'a' (not 'm')\n  - Position 14: 'l' (not 'm')\n  - Position 15: 'x' (not 'm')\n  - Position 16: 'm' (fourth 'm', position 16)\n  - Position 17: 'f' (not 'm')\n  - Position 18: 'm' (fifth 'm', position 18)\n  - Position 19: 'l' (not 'm')\n  - Position 20: 'j' (not 'm')\n  - Position 21: 'l' (not 'm')\n  - Position 22: 't' (not 'm')\n  - Position 23: 'j' (not 'm')\n  - Position 24: 'o' (not 'm')\n\n- We found 5 occurrences of 'm' at positions 4, 5, 8, 16, and 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [4, 5, 8, 16, 18]>>>"
