    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"palaeoclimatological\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"palaeoclimatological\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'a'**:\n   - Start from the first letter and move to the last, checking each letter to see if it is 'a'.\n   - Keep a count of how many times 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'a'**:\n   - As you identify each 'a', note its position in the word.\n   - Remember that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - Create a list of all the positions where 'a' appears.\n\n5. **Output the result**:\n   - Format the result to show the count of 'a's and their positions in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"palaeoclimatological\":\n\n- The word is \"palaeoclimatological\".\n- The letter 'a' appears in the following positions: 2, 4, 11.\n- Count of 'a's: 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [2, 4, 11]>>>"
