    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word \"diplospondylism\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"diplospondylism\".\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences of 'y'**: \n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'y' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions**:\n   - As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions of each 'y'. \n   - Remember that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Analyze the Word**:\n   - The word \"diplospondylism\" is 15 letters long.\n   - We will examine each letter in sequence:\n\n     - d (1)\n     - i (2)\n     - p (3)\n     - l (4)\n     - o (5)\n     - s (6)\n     - p (7)\n     - o (8)\n     - n (9)\n     - d (10)\n     - y (11) - First occurrence of 'y'\n     - l (12)\n     - i (13)\n     - s (14)\n     - m (15)\n\n5. **Count and Record Positions**:\n   - We found 'y' at position 11.\n   - Total count of 'y' is 1.\n\n6. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Count of 'y': 1\n   - Position of 'y': [11]\n\nNow, we can present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [11]>>>"
