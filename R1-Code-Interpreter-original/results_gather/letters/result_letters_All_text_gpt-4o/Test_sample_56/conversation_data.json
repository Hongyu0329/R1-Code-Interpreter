    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"stereoroentgenography\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"stereoroentgenography\".\n\n2. **Count occurrences of 'g'**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine positions**: As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions of each 'g'. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**: After identifying the positions, we will list them in order.\n\nLet's perform the analysis:\n\n- The word \"stereoroentgenography\" is 20 letters long.\n- We will examine each letter:\n\n  1. s\n  2. t\n  3. e\n  4. r\n  5. e\n  6. o\n  7. r\n  8. o\n  9. e\n  10. n\n  11. t\n  12. g (1st occurrence at position 12)\n  13. e\n  14. n\n  15. o\n  16. g (2nd occurrence at position 16)\n  17. r\n  18. a\n  19. p\n  20. h\n  21. y\n\n- We found two 'g's in the word.\n- The positions of 'g' are 12 and 16.\n\nNow, we can compile the final answer:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [12, 16]>>>"
