    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"dismortgaging\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"dismortgaging\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'g'**:\n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'g'**:\n   - As we count the 'g's, we also need to note their positions in the word. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **Go through the word**:\n   - The word \"dismortgaging\" has 13 letters.\n   - Check each letter one by one:\n     - Position 1: 'd' (not 'g')\n     - Position 2: 'i' (not 'g')\n     - Position 3: 's' (not 'g')\n     - Position 4: 'm' (not 'g')\n     - Position 5: 'o' (not 'g')\n     - Position 6: 'r' (not 'g')\n     - Position 7: 't' (not 'g')\n     - Position 8: 'g' (first 'g')\n     - Position 9: 'a' (not 'g')\n     - Position 10: 'g' (second 'g')\n     - Position 11: 'i' (not 'g')\n     - Position 12: 'n' (not 'g')\n     - Position 13: 'g' (third 'g')\n\n5. **Count and list positions**:\n   - Total 'g's found: 3\n   - Positions of 'g': 8, 10, 13\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [8, 10, 13]>>>"
