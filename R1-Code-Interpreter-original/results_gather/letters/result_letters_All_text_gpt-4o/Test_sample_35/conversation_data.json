    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"nonassimilating\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"nonassimilating\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'm'**:\n   - Go through each letter in the word \"nonassimilating\".\n   - Check if the letter is 'm'.\n   - Keep a count of how many times 'm' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'm'**:\n   - As you go through each letter, note the position (starting from 1) whenever you encounter 'm'.\n   - Record these positions.\n\n4. **Perform the analysis**:\n   - The word \"nonassimilating\" is 14 letters long.\n   - Check each letter:\n     - n (1), o (2), n (3), a (4), s (5), s (6), i (7), m (8), i (9), l (10), a (11), t (12), i (13), n (14).\n   - The letter 'm' appears once at position 8.\n\n5. **Compile the results**:\n   - Count of 'm': 1\n   - Position of 'm': [8]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [8]>>>"
