    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word 'thymolsulphonephthalein' and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is 'thymolsulphonephthalein'.\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 's'**: \n   - Go through each letter in the word and count how many times 's' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 's'**:\n   - As you go through the word, note the position of each 's'. Remember that the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - Collect all the positions where 's' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word 'thymolsulphonephthalein':\n\n- The word is: thymolsulphonephthalein\n- Count the 's's:\n  - The first 's' is at position 6.\n  - The second 's' is at position 9.\n\n- Total count of 's': 2\n- Positions of 's': [6, 9]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [6, 9]>>>"
