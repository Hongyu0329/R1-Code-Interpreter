    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"acetylphenylhydrazine\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears and at which positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"acetylphenylhydrazine\".\n\n2. **Count the 'y's**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times the letter 'y' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions**: As we count the 'y's, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **List the Positions**: After identifying the positions, we will list them in order.\n\nNow, let's perform the analysis:\n\n- The word \"acetylphenylhydrazine\" is 20 letters long.\n- We will examine each letter in the word:\n\n  1. a\n  2. c\n  3. e\n  4. t\n  5. y (Position 5)\n  6. l\n  7. p\n  8. h\n  9. e\n  10. n\n  11. y (Position 11)\n  12. l\n  13. h\n  14. y (Position 14)\n  15. d\n  16. r\n  17. a\n  18. z\n  19. i\n  20. n\n  21. e\n\n- We found the letter 'y' at positions 5, 11, and 14.\n\n- The total count of 'y's is 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [5, 11, 14]>>>"
