    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"smilemaking\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"smilemaking\".\n\n2. **Count the 'm's**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'm' appears.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: As we count the 'm's, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - The word \"smilemaking\" has 11 letters.\n   - Let's examine each letter:\n     - Position 1: 's' (not 'm')\n     - Position 2: 'm' (first 'm')\n     - Position 3: 'i' (not 'm')\n     - Position 4: 'l' (not 'm')\n     - Position 5: 'e' (not 'm')\n     - Position 6: 'm' (second 'm')\n     - Position 7: 'a' (not 'm')\n     - Position 8: 'k' (not 'm')\n     - Position 9: 'i' (not 'm')\n     - Position 10: 'n' (not 'm')\n     - Position 11: 'g' (not 'm')\n\n5. **Count and Positions**:\n   - We found 'm' at positions 2 and 6.\n   - Total count of 'm's is 2.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: We have determined the count and positions of 'm' in the word \"smilemaking\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 2, Positions: [2, 6]>>>."
