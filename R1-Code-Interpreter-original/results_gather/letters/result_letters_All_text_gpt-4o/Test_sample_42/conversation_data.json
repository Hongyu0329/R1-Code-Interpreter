    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"nonexpeditiousness\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"nonexpeditiousness\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 's'**: \n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 's' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 's'**:\n   - As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the position of each 's'. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - After identifying the positions, we will list them in order.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- The word \"nonexpeditiousness\" is 17 letters long.\n- We will examine each letter:\n\n  1. n\n  2. o\n  3. n\n  4. e\n  5. x\n  6. p\n  7. e\n  8. d\n  9. i\n  10. t\n  11. i\n  12. o\n  13. u\n  14. s (1st occurrence at position 14)\n  15. n\n  16. e\n  17. s (2nd occurrence at position 17)\n  18. s (3rd occurrence at position 18)\n\n- We found three occurrences of 's' at positions 14, 17, and 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [14, 17, 18]>>>"
