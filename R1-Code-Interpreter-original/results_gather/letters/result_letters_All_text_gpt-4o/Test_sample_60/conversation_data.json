    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"nondeterministically\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"nondeterministically\".\n\n2. **Locate the letter 'm'**: We need to find all occurrences of the letter 'm' in the word.\n\n3. **Count the occurrences**: As we locate each 'm', we will keep a count of how many times it appears.\n\n4. **Determine the positions**: For each 'm' found, note its position in the word. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n5. **List the positions**: Collect all the positions where 'm' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"nondeterministically\":\n\n- The word is \"nondeterministically\".\n- We scan through the word to find 'm':\n  - The first 'm' is found at position 8.\n- There are no more 'm's in the word.\n\nThus, the letter 'm' appears once in the word, and its position is 8.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [8]>>>"
