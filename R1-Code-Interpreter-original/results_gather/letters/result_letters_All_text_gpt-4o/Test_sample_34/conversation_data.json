    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of occurrences of the letter 'g' in the given word and the positions of these occurrences. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word provided is 'voekrxlgfgdmgkzgg'.\n\n2. **Count the 'g's**: We need to go through each character in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions**: As we count the 'g's, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Word**: \n   - Start from the first character and move to the last.\n   - For each character, check if it is 'g'.\n   - If it is 'g', increase the count by 1 and record the position.\n\n5. **Compile the Results**: After iterating through the word, compile the total count of 'g's and their respective positions.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word 'voekrxlgfgdmgkzgg':\n\n- The word is 17 characters long.\n- We will check each character one by one:\n\n  1. v (not 'g')\n  2. o (not 'g')\n  3. e (not 'g')\n  4. k (not 'g')\n  5. r (not 'g')\n  6. x (not 'g')\n  7. l (not 'g')\n  8. g (is 'g', position 8)\n  9. f (not 'g')\n  10. g (is 'g', position 10)\n  11. d (not 'g')\n  12. m (not 'g')\n  13. g (is 'g', position 13)\n  14. k (not 'g')\n  15. z (not 'g')\n  16. g (is 'g', position 16)\n  17. g (is 'g', position 17)\n\n- Total count of 'g's: 5\n- Positions of 'g's: [8, 10, 13, 16, 17]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [8, 10, 13, 16, 17]>>>"
