    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"overconscientiousness\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"overconscientiousness\".\n\n2. **Count the 's's**: We need to count how many times the letter 's' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 's' in the word. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"overconscientiousness\".\n   - Keep a count of how many 's's are found.\n   - Record the position of each 's'.\n\n5. **Word Analysis**:\n   - The word \"overconscientiousness\" has 20 letters.\n   - Let's go through each letter:\n     - 1: o\n     - 2: v\n     - 3: e\n     - 4: r\n     - 5: c\n     - 6: o\n     - 7: n\n     - 8: s (1st occurrence)\n     - 9: c\n     - 10: i\n     - 11: e\n     - 12: n\n     - 13: t\n     - 14: i\n     - 15: o\n     - 16: u\n     - 17: s (2nd occurrence)\n     - 18: n\n     - 19: e\n     - 20: s (3rd occurrence)\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - Total 's's found: 3\n   - Positions of 's': 8, 17, 20\n\n7. **Final Answer**: We have found 3 's's in the word \"overconscientiousness\" at positions 8, 17, and 20.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 3, Positions: [8, 17, 20]>>>."
