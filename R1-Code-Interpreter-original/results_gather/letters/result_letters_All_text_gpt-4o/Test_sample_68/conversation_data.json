    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"overconscientiousness\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"overconscientiousness\".\n\n2. **Count the 's's**: We need to count how many times the letter 's' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 's' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Write down the word: \"overconscientiousness\".\n   - Go through each letter in the word and check if it is 's'.\n   - Keep a count of how many 's's are found.\n   - Record the position of each 's'.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - The word \"overconscientiousness\" has 20 letters.\n   - Check each letter:\n     - 1st letter: 'o' (not 's')\n     - 2nd letter: 'v' (not 's')\n     - 3rd letter: 'e' (not 's')\n     - 4th letter: 'r' (not 's')\n     - 5th letter: 'c' (not 's')\n     - 6th letter: 'o' (not 's')\n     - 7th letter: 'n' (not 's')\n     - 8th letter: 's' (1st 's', position 8)\n     - 9th letter: 'c' (not 's')\n     - 10th letter: 'i' (not 's')\n     - 11th letter: 'e' (not 's')\n     - 12th letter: 'n' (not 's')\n     - 13th letter: 't' (not 's')\n     - 14th letter: 'i' (not 's')\n     - 15th letter: 'o' (not 's')\n     - 16th letter: 'u' (not 's')\n     - 17th letter: 's' (2nd 's', position 17)\n     - 18th letter: 'n' (not 's')\n     - 19th letter: 'e' (not 's')\n     - 20th letter: 's' (3rd 's', position 20)\n\n6. **Result**:\n   - Total count of 's': 3\n   - Positions of 's': 8, 17, 20\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [8, 17, 20]>>>"
