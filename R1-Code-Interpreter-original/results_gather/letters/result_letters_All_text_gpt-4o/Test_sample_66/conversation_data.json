    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"microelectrophoresis\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"microelectrophoresis\".\n\n2. **Count the 's's**: We need to count how many times the letter 's' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 's' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Write down the word: microelectrophoresis\n   - Identify each 's' and note its position:\n     - The first 's' is at position 15.\n     - The second 's' is at position 18.\n     - The third 's' is at position 20.\n\n5. **Count the 's's**: There are 3 occurrences of the letter 's'.\n\n6. **List the Positions**: The positions of 's' are 15, 18, and 20.\n\n7. **Compile the Answer**: We have determined that there are 3 's's and their positions are 15, 18, and 20.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [15, 18, 20]>>>"
