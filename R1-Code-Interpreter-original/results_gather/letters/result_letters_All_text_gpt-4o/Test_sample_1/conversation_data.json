    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"accroachment\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"accroachment\".\n\n2. **Count the 'a's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'a' in the word. Note that the positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Analyze the Word**:\n   - The word \"accroachment\" is 12 letters long.\n   - We will examine each letter in the word to find the occurrences of 'a'.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Position 1: The letter is 'a'. This is the first occurrence.\n   - Position 2: The letter is 'c'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 3: The letter is 'c'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 4: The letter is 'r'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 5: The letter is 'o'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 6: The letter is 'a'. This is the second occurrence.\n   - Position 7: The letter is 'c'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 8: The letter is 'h'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 9: The letter is 'm'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 10: The letter is 'e'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 11: The letter is 'n'. Not 'a'.\n   - Position 12: The letter is 't'. Not 'a'.\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - We found 2 occurrences of the letter 'a'.\n   - The positions of 'a' are 1 and 6.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - Count of 'a's: 2\n   - Positions of 'a's: [1, 6]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [1, 6]>>>"
