    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"disestablishmentarianism\" and identify the occurrences of the letter 'a'. We will also determine the positions of these occurrences, counting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"disestablishmentarianism\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'a'**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'a'**: As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions of each 'a'. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**: After identifying the positions, we will list them in order.\n\nLet's go through the word:\n\n- The word is \"disestablishmentarianism\".\n- We will check each letter:\n\n  1. d (1st position) - not 'a'\n  2. i (2nd position) - not 'a'\n  3. s (3rd position) - not 'a'\n  4. e (4th position) - not 'a'\n  5. s (5th position) - not 'a'\n  6. t (6th position) - not 'a'\n  7. a (7th position) - 'a' found\n  8. b (8th position) - not 'a'\n  9. l (9th position) - not 'a'\n  10. i (10th position) - not 'a'\n  11. s (11th position) - not 'a'\n  12. h (12th position) - not 'a'\n  13. m (13th position) - not 'a'\n  14. e (14th position) - not 'a'\n  15. n (15th position) - not 'a'\n  16. t (16th position) - not 'a'\n  17. a (17th position) - 'a' found\n  18. r (18th position) - not 'a'\n  19. i (19th position) - not 'a'\n  20. a (20th position) - 'a' found\n  21. n (21st position) - not 'a'\n  22. i (22nd position) - not 'a'\n  23. s (23rd position) - not 'a'\n  24. m (24th position) - not 'a'\n\n- We found 'a' at positions 7, 17, and 20.\n\n5. **Count of 'a'**: There are 3 occurrences of 'a'.\n\n6. **Positions of 'a'**: The positions are 7, 17, and 20.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [7, 17, 20]>>>"
