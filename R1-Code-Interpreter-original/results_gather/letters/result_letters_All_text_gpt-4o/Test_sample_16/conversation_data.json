    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"scalenohedrons\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"scalenohedrons\".\n\n2. **Count the 's's**: We need to count how many times the letter 's' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 's' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"scalenohedrons\".\n   - Check if the letter is 's'.\n   - If it is 's', note its position.\n\n5. **Word Analysis**:\n   - The word \"scalenohedrons\" has 14 letters.\n   - The letter 's' appears at the following positions:\n     - Position 1: 's'\n     - Position 14: 's'\n\n6. **Count of 's's**: There are 2 occurrences of the letter 's'.\n\n7. **Positions of 's's**: The positions are 1 and 14.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the count and positions of the letter 's' in the word \"scalenohedrons\".\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [1, 14]>>>"
