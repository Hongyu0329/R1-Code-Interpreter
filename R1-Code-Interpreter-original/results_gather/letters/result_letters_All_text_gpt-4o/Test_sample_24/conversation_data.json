    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word \"yqyyxelyfgyjp\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"yqyyxelyfgyjp\".\n\n2. **Initialize a counter and a list**: \n   - A counter to keep track of the number of 'y's.\n   - A list to store the positions of each 'y'.\n\n3. **Iterate through the word**:\n   - Check each character in the word.\n   - If the character is 'y', increment the counter and record the position.\n\n4. **Count the positions starting from 1**:\n   - The first character in the word is at position 1, the second at position 2, and so on.\n\n5. **List the positions**:\n   - As we find each 'y', we note its position.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"yqyyxelyfgyjp\":\n\n- The word is \"yqyyxelyfgyjp\".\n- We will check each character one by one:\n\n  1. Position 1: 'y' (count = 1, positions = [1])\n  2. Position 2: 'q' (not 'y')\n  3. Position 3: 'y' (count = 2, positions = [1, 3])\n  4. Position 4: 'y' (count = 3, positions = [1, 3, 4])\n  5. Position 5: 'x' (not 'y')\n  6. Position 6: 'e' (not 'y')\n  7. Position 7: 'l' (not 'y')\n  8. Position 8: 'y' (count = 4, positions = [1, 3, 4, 8])\n  9. Position 9: 'f' (not 'y')\n  10. Position 10: 'g' (not 'y')\n  11. Position 11: 'y' (count = 5, positions = [1, 3, 4, 8, 11])\n  12. Position 12: 'j' (not 'y')\n  13. Position 13: 'p' (not 'y')\n\n- After checking all characters, we find that there are 5 'y's in the word, and their positions are [1, 3, 4, 8, 11].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 3, 4, 8, 11]>>>"
