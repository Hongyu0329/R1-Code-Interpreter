    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"opinionatedness\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"opinionatedness\".\n\n2. **Count the 's's**: We need to count how many times the letter 's' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 's' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Analyze the Word**:\n   - The word \"opinionatedness\" is 14 letters long.\n   - We will go through each letter in the word and check if it is 's'.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Position 1: 'o' (not 's')\n   - Position 2: 'p' (not 's')\n   - Position 3: 'i' (not 's')\n   - Position 4: 'n' (not 's')\n   - Position 5: 'i' (not 's')\n   - Position 6: 'o' (not 's')\n   - Position 7: 'n' (not 's')\n   - Position 8: 'a' (not 's')\n   - Position 9: 't' (not 's')\n   - Position 10: 'e' (not 's')\n   - Position 11: 'd' (not 's')\n   - Position 12: 'n' (not 's')\n   - Position 13: 'e' (not 's')\n   - Position 14: 's' (this is 's')\n   - Position 15: 's' (this is 's')\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - The letter 's' appears 2 times.\n   - The positions of 's' are 14 and 15.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: We have determined the count and positions of 's' in the word.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 2, Positions: [14, 15]>>>."
