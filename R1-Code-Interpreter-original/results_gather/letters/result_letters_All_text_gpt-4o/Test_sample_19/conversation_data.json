    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"christlessness\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"christlessness\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 's'**: \n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 's' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 's'**:\n   - As we count each 's', we also need to note its position in the word. Remember, the position starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - As we find each 's', we record its position in a list.\n\nLet's go through the word \"christlessness\":\n\n- Position 1: 'c' (not 's')\n- Position 2: 'h' (not 's')\n- Position 3: 'r' (not 's')\n- Position 4: 'i' (not 's')\n- Position 5: 's' (first 's')\n- Position 6: 't' (not 's')\n- Position 7: 'l' (not 's')\n- Position 8: 'e' (not 's')\n- Position 9: 's' (second 's')\n- Position 10: 's' (third 's')\n- Position 11: 'n' (not 's')\n- Position 12: 'e' (not 's')\n- Position 13: 's' (fourth 's')\n- Position 14: 's' (fifth 's')\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that there are 5 occurrences of 's' in the word \"christlessness\". The positions of 's' are 5, 9, 10, 13, and 14.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [5, 9, 10, 13, 14]>>>"
