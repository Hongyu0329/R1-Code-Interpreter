    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"disestablishmentarianism\" and identify the occurrences of the letter 'a'. We will also determine the positions of these occurrences, counting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"disestablishmentarianism\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'a'**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions**: As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions of each 'a'. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**: After identifying the positions, we will list them in order.\n\nNow, let's perform the analysis:\n\n- The word \"disestablishmentarianism\" is 24 letters long.\n- We will examine each letter in the word:\n\n  1. d\n  2. i\n  3. s\n  4. e\n  5. s\n  6. t\n  7. a (1st occurrence, position 7)\n  8. b\n  9. l\n  10. i\n  11. s\n  12. h\n  13. m\n  14. e\n  15. n\n  16. t\n  17. a (2nd occurrence, position 17)\n  18. r\n  19. i\n  20. a (3rd occurrence, position 20)\n  21. n\n  22. i\n  23. s\n  24. m\n\n- We found three occurrences of 'a' at positions 7, 17, and 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [7, 17, 20]>>>"
