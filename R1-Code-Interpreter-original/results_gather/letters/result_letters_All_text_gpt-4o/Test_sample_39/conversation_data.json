    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"mqfmxdqifuwmtmbsmrt\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nLet's analyze the word step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the occurrences of 'm':**\n   - Start from the first character and move to the last character of the word.\n   - Check each character to see if it is 'm'.\n\n2. **Count the occurrences and note the positions:**\n   - As we find each 'm', we will increment our count.\n   - We will also record the position of each 'm'.\n\n3. **List the positions:**\n   - The positions are based on a 1-based index, meaning the first character is position 1, the second character is position 2, and so on.\n\nNow, let's go through the word \"mqfmxdqifuwmtmbsmrt\":\n\n- Position 1: 'm' (Count = 1, Position = 1)\n- Position 2: 'q'\n- Position 3: 'f'\n- Position 4: 'm' (Count = 2, Position = 4)\n- Position 5: 'x'\n- Position 6: 'd'\n- Position 7: 'q'\n- Position 8: 'i'\n- Position 9: 'f'\n- Position 10: 'u'\n- Position 11: 'w'\n- Position 12: 'm' (Count = 3, Position = 12)\n- Position 13: 't'\n- Position 14: 'm' (Count = 4, Position = 14)\n- Position 15: 'b'\n- Position 16: 's'\n- Position 17: 'm' (Count = 5, Position = 17)\n- Position 18: 'r'\n- Position 19: 't'\n\n**Final Count and Positions:**\n- Total 'm's found: 5\n- Positions of 'm': [1, 4, 12, 14, 17]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 4, 12, 14, 17]>>>"
