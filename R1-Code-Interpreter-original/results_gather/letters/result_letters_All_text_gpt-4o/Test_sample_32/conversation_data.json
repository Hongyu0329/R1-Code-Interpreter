    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"nonagglutinating\" and determine how many times the letter 'g' appears and at which positions. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"nonagglutinating\".\n\n2. **Count the 'g's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'g' in the word. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"nonagglutinating\".\n   - Check if the letter is 'g'.\n   - If it is 'g', note the position.\n\n5. **Word Analysis**:\n   - The word \"nonagglutinating\" has 16 letters.\n   - The letter 'g' appears in the following positions:\n     - 7th position: 'n', 'o', 'n', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'l', 'u', 't', 'i', 'n', 'a', 't', 'i', 'n', 'g'\n     - 16th position: 'n', 'o', 'n', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'l', 'u', 't', 'i', 'n', 'a', 't', 'i', 'n', 'g'\n\n6. **Count and List Positions**:\n   - There are 2 'g's in the word.\n   - The positions of 'g' are 7 and 16.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [7, 16]>>>"
