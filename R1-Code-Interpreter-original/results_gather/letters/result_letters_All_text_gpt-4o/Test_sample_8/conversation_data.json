    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"lallygagging\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"lallygagging\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'g'**: \n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'g'**:\n   - As we count each 'g', we also need to note its position in the word. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **Go through the word \"lallygagging\"**:\n   - l (position 1) - not 'g'\n   - a (position 2) - not 'g'\n   - l (position 3) - not 'g'\n   - l (position 4) - not 'g'\n   - y (position 5) - not 'g'\n   - g (position 6) - 'g' found\n   - a (position 7) - not 'g'\n   - g (position 8) - 'g' found\n   - g (position 9) - 'g' found\n   - i (position 10) - not 'g'\n   - n (position 11) - not 'g'\n   - g (position 12) - 'g' found\n\n5. **Count and list positions**:\n   - Total 'g's found: 4\n   - Positions of 'g': 6, 8, 9, 12\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [6, 8, 9, 12]>>>"
