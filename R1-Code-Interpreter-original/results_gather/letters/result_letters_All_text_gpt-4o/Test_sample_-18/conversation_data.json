    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the given word and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is 'nmfghmzgvjinzgmijkdxs'.\n\n2. **Initialize a counter and a list**: We will use a counter to keep track of the number of 'g's and a list to store their positions.\n\n3. **Iterate through the word**: We will go through each character in the word, checking if it is 'g'.\n\n4. **Check each character**:\n   - If the character is 'g', increment the counter by 1.\n   - Record the position of 'g' in the list. Remember that positions start from 1, so we need to add 1 to the index of the character.\n\n5. **Count and record positions**:\n   - The first 'g' is at position 4.\n   - The second 'g' is at position 8.\n   - The third 'g' is at position 14.\n\n6. **Compile the results**: We have found 3 occurrences of 'g' at positions 4, 8, and 14.\n\nNow, we can present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [4, 8, 14]>>>"
