    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"phylactolaemata\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"phylactolaemata\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'a'**:\n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'a'**:\n   - As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the positions where 'a' appears. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **Go through the word**:\n   - The word \"phylactolaemata\" has 14 letters.\n   - Check each letter one by one:\n     - 1st letter: 'p' (not 'a')\n     - 2nd letter: 'h' (not 'a')\n     - 3rd letter: 'y' (not 'a')\n     - 4th letter: 'l' (not 'a')\n     - 5th letter: 'a' (is 'a', position 5)\n     - 6th letter: 'c' (not 'a')\n     - 7th letter: 't' (not 'a')\n     - 8th letter: 'o' (not 'a')\n     - 9th letter: 'l' (not 'a')\n     - 10th letter: 'a' (is 'a', position 10)\n     - 11th letter: 'e' (not 'a')\n     - 12th letter: 'm' (not 'a')\n     - 13th letter: 'a' (is 'a', position 13)\n     - 14th letter: 't' (not 'a')\n     - 15th letter: 'a' (is 'a', position 15)\n\n5. **Count and list positions**:\n   - Total 'a's found: 4\n   - Positions of 'a': 5, 10, 13, 15\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [5, 10, 13, 15]>>>"
