    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"microelectrophoresis\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"microelectrophoresis\".\n\n2. **Count the 's's**: We need to count how many times the letter 's' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 's' in the word. Note that the positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Write down the word: microelectrophoresis\n   - Identify each occurrence of 's':\n     - The first 's' is at position 15.\n     - The second 's' is at position 18.\n     - The third 's' is at position 20.\n   - Count the total number of 's's: There are 3 occurrences.\n\n5. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Count of 's's: 3\n   - Positions of 's's: [15, 18, 20]\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined both the count and the positions of the letter 's' in the word \"microelectrophoresis\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 3, Positions: [15, 18, 20]>>>."
