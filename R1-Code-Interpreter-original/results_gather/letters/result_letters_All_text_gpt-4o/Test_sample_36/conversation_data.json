    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"instrumentalism\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"instrumentalism\".\n\n2. **Count the 'm's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'm' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Analyze the Word**:\n   - The word \"instrumentalism\" has 15 letters.\n   - We will go through each letter in the word and check if it is 'm'.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Position 1: 'i' (not 'm')\n   - Position 2: 'n' (not 'm')\n   - Position 3: 's' (not 'm')\n   - Position 4: 't' (not 'm')\n   - Position 5: 'r' (not 'm')\n   - Position 6: 'u' (not 'm')\n   - Position 7: 'm' (first 'm' found)\n   - Position 8: 'e' (not 'm')\n   - Position 9: 'n' (not 'm')\n   - Position 10: 't' (not 'm')\n   - Position 11: 'a' (not 'm')\n   - Position 12: 'l' (not 'm')\n   - Position 13: 'i' (not 'm')\n   - Position 14: 's' (not 'm')\n   - Position 15: 'm' (second 'm' found)\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - We found 2 occurrences of 'm'.\n   - The positions of 'm' are 7 and 15.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: We have determined the count and positions of 'm' in the word \"instrumentalism\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 2, Positions: [7, 15]>>>."
