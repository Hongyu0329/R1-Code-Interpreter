    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"commentarialism\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"commentarialism\".\n\n2. **Count the 's's**: We need to count how many times the letter 's' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 's' in the word. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Write down the word: commentarialism\n   - Identify each letter and its position:\n     - c (1)\n     - o (2)\n     - m (3)\n     - m (4)\n     - e (5)\n     - n (6)\n     - t (7)\n     - a (8)\n     - r (9)\n     - i (10)\n     - a (11)\n     - l (12)\n     - i (13)\n     - s (14)\n     - m (15)\n\n5. **Count the 's's**: \n   - There is 1 's' in the word.\n\n6. **Find the Position of 's'**:\n   - The 's' is at position 14.\n\n7. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Count of 's': 1\n   - Position of 's': 14\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [14]>>>"
