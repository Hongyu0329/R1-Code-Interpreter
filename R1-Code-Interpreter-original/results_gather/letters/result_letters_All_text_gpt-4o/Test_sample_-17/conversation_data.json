    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word 'bmmgtjgzorlbgkwvroerqhkg' and determine how many times the letter 'g' appears and at which positions. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Task**: We need to count the occurrences of the letter 'g' and find their positions in the given word.\n\n2. **Understand the Positioning**: The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0. This means the first letter of the word is at position 1, the second letter is at position 2, and so on.\n\n3. **Examine the Word**: The word given is 'bmmgtjgzorlbgkwvroerqhkg'.\n\n4. **Scan the Word**: We will go through each letter in the word and check if it is 'g'. If it is, we will note the position.\n\n5. **Count and Record Positions**:\n   - Position 1: 'b' (not 'g')\n   - Position 2: 'm' (not 'g')\n   - Position 3: 'm' (not 'g')\n   - Position 4: 'g' (is 'g', record position 4)\n   - Position 5: 't' (not 'g')\n   - Position 6: 'j' (not 'g')\n   - Position 7: 'g' (is 'g', record position 7)\n   - Position 8: 'z' (not 'g')\n   - Position 9: 'o' (not 'g')\n   - Position 10: 'r' (not 'g')\n   - Position 11: 'l' (not 'g')\n   - Position 12: 'b' (not 'g')\n   - Position 13: 'g' (is 'g', record position 13)\n   - Position 14: 'k' (not 'g')\n   - Position 15: 'w' (not 'g')\n   - Position 16: 'v' (not 'g')\n   - Position 17: 'r' (not 'g')\n   - Position 18: 'o' (not 'g')\n   - Position 19: 'e' (not 'g')\n   - Position 20: 'r' (not 'g')\n   - Position 21: 'q' (not 'g')\n   - Position 22: 'h' (not 'g')\n   - Position 23: 'k' (not 'g')\n   - Position 24: 'g' (is 'g', record position 24)\n\n6. **Count the 'g's**: We have found 'g' at positions 4, 7, 13, and 24. This means there are 4 occurrences of 'g'.\n\n7. **Compile the Results**: We have counted 4 'g's and their positions are [4, 7, 13, 24].\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [4, 7, 13, 24]>>>"
