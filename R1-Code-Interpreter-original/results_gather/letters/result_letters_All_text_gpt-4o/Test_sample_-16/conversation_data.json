    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the given word and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word provided is 'gudolnxldzgfsgmgxnnalfgi'.\n\n2. **Initialize Count and Positions**: Start with a count of 0 for the letter 'g' and an empty list to store the positions.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Word**: Go through each character in the word, keeping track of the current position (starting from 1, not 0).\n\n4. **Check for 'g'**: For each character, check if it is 'g'. If it is, increment the count by 1 and add the current position to the list of positions.\n\n5. **Continue Until End of Word**: Repeat the process until you have checked every character in the word.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Once the iteration is complete, output the total count of 'g's and the list of positions where 'g' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word 'gudolnxldzgfsgmgxnnalfgi':\n\n- The word is 25 characters long.\n- As we iterate through the word:\n  - Position 1: 'g' (Count = 1, Positions = [1])\n  - Position 11: 'g' (Count = 2, Positions = [1, 11])\n  - Position 14: 'g' (Count = 3, Positions = [1, 11, 14])\n  - Position 16: 'g' (Count = 4, Positions = [1, 11, 14, 16])\n  - Position 25: 'g' (Count = 5, Positions = [1, 11, 14, 16, 25])\n\nAfter checking all characters, we find that there are 5 occurrences of 'g' at positions 1, 11, 14, 16, and 25.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [1, 11, 14, 16, 25]>>>"
