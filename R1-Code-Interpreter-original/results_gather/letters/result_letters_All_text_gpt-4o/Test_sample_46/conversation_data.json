    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"hypophysectomies\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in it, as well as the positions of these occurrences. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"hypophysectomies\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'y'**:\n   - Look through each letter in the word to find 'y'.\n   - The word \"hypophysectomies\" is composed of 15 letters.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'y'**:\n   - Start counting from the first letter, which is position 1.\n   - Identify each position where 'y' appears.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - The first 'y' is at position 3.\n   - The second 'y' is at position 6.\n\n5. **Count the total number of 'y's**:\n   - There are 2 occurrences of 'y' in the word.\n\n6. **Compile the results**:\n   - Total count of 'y': 2\n   - Positions of 'y': [3, 6]\n\nNow, we can present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [3, 6]>>>"
