    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"thymolsulphonephthalein\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"thymolsulphonephthalein\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 's'**: \n   - Go through each letter in the word and count how many times 's' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 's'**:\n   - As we count the occurrences, note the position of each 's'. Remember that the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - Create a list of all the positions where 's' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- The word is \"thymolsulphonephthalein\".\n- We will go through each letter:\n\n  1. t (1)\n  2. h (2)\n  3. y (3)\n  4. m (4)\n  5. o (5)\n  6. l (6)\n  7. s (7) - First 's' found at position 7\n  8. u (8)\n  9. l (9)\n  10. p (10)\n  11. h (11)\n  12. o (12)\n  13. n (13)\n  14. e (14)\n  15. p (15)\n  16. h (16)\n  17. t (17)\n  18. h (18)\n  19. a (19)\n  20. l (20)\n  21. e (21)\n  22. i (22)\n  23. n (23)\n\n- We found one 's' at position 7.\n\n- Therefore, the count of 's' is 1, and the position is [7].\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [7]>>>"
