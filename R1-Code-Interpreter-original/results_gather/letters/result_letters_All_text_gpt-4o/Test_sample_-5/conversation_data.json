    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"tychoparthenogenesis\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears and at which positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"tychoparthenogenesis\".\n\n2. **Count the 'y's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'y' in the word. Note that the positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"tychoparthenogenesis\".\n   - Check if the letter is 'y'.\n   - If it is 'y', note the position.\n\n5. **Perform the Analysis**:\n   - The word \"tychoparthenogenesis\" is 20 letters long.\n   - The letter 'y' appears once in the word.\n   - The position of 'y' is 2 (since we start counting from 1).\n\n6. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Count of 'y': 1\n   - Position of 'y': 2\n\nNow, we can present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [2]>>>"
