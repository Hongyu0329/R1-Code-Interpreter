    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word \"mesembryanthemaceae\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"mesembryanthemaceae\".\n\n2. **Count the 'm's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'm' appears in this word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'm' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"mesembryanthemaceae\".\n   - Keep a count of how many 'm's are encountered.\n   - Record the position of each 'm'.\n\n5. **Detailed Examination**:\n   - The word is \"mesembryanthemaceae\".\n   - The first 'm' is at position 2.\n   - The second 'm' is at position 5.\n   - The third 'm' is at position 12.\n\n6. **Count of 'm's**: There are 3 'm's in the word.\n\n7. **Positions of 'm's**: The positions are 2, 5, and 12.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined both the count and the positions of the letter 'm' in the word.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [2, 5, 12]>>>"
