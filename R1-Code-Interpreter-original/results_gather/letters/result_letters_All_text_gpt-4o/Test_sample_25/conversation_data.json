    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"superterrestial\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"superterrestial\".\n\n2. **Count the 'a's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'a' in the word. Note that the positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Write down the word: \"superterrestial\".\n   - Go through each letter in the word and check if it is 'a'.\n   - Keep a count of how many 'a's are found.\n   - Record the position of each 'a'.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - The word \"superterrestial\" is 15 letters long.\n   - Check each letter:\n     - s (1), u (2), p (3), e (4), r (5), t (6), e (7), r (8), r (9), e (10), s (11), t (12), i (13), a (14), l (15).\n   - The letter 'a' appears once, at position 14.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is 1 'a' in the word \"superterrestial\".\n   - The position of 'a' is 14.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [14]>>>"
