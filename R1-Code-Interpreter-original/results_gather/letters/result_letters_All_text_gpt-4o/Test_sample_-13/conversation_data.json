    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given word \"mbxxoatfbjtfpndbkyssmm\" and determine how many times the letter 'm' appears in it, as well as the positions of each occurrence. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Task**: We need to count the occurrences of the letter 'm' and find their positions in the word.\n\n2. **Understand the Positioning**: The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0. This means the first character in the word is at position 1, the second character is at position 2, and so on.\n\n3. **Examine the Word**: The word given is \"mbxxoatfbjtfpndbkyssmm\".\n\n4. **Scan the Word**: We will go through each character in the word and check if it is 'm'. If it is, we will note its position.\n\n5. **Count and Record Positions**:\n   - The first character is 'm' at position 1.\n   - The second character is 'b', not 'm'.\n   - Continue this process for each character.\n   - The last two characters are both 'm' at positions 21 and 22.\n\n6. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Total count of 'm's: 3\n   - Positions of 'm's: 1, 21, 22\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: According to the required format, we need to present the count and positions in a specific way.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [1, 21, 22]>>>"
