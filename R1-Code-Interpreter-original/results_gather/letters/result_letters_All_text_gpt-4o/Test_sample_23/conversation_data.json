    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word \"ywxzriyfyzyeb\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nLet's analyze the word step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"ywxzriyfyzyeb\".\n\n2. **Initialize a counter and a list**: \n   - Set a counter to 0 to keep track of the number of 'y's.\n   - Create an empty list to store the positions of 'y's.\n\n3. **Iterate through each character in the word**:\n   - Check each character one by one.\n   - If the character is 'y', increment the counter by 1 and add the current position to the list.\n\n4. **Count and record positions**:\n   - Position 1: 'y' (increment counter to 1, add position 1 to the list)\n   - Position 2: 'w' (not 'y', do nothing)\n   - Position 3: 'x' (not 'y', do nothing)\n   - Position 4: 'z' (not 'y', do nothing)\n   - Position 5: 'r' (not 'y', do nothing)\n   - Position 6: 'i' (not 'y', do nothing)\n   - Position 7: 'y' (increment counter to 2, add position 7 to the list)\n   - Position 8: 'f' (not 'y', do nothing)\n   - Position 9: 'y' (increment counter to 3, add position 9 to the list)\n   - Position 10: 'z' (not 'y', do nothing)\n   - Position 11: 'y' (increment counter to 4, add position 11 to the list)\n   - Position 12: 'e' (not 'y', do nothing)\n   - Position 13: 'b' (not 'y', do nothing)\n\n5. **Final count and positions**:\n   - Total count of 'y': 4\n   - Positions of 'y': [1, 7, 9, 11]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 4, Positions: [1, 7, 9, 11]>>>"
