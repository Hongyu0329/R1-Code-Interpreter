    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"intracanonical\" and determine how many times the letter 'a' appears and at which positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"intracanonical\".\n\n2. **Count the 'a's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'a' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"intracanonical\".\n   - Check if the letter is 'a'.\n   - If it is 'a', note its position.\n\n5. **Word Breakdown**:\n   - i (1)\n   - n (2)\n   - t (3)\n   - r (4)\n   - a (5) -> First 'a'\n   - c (6)\n   - a (7) -> Second 'a'\n   - n (8)\n   - o (9)\n   - n (10)\n   - i (11)\n   - c (12)\n   - a (13) -> Third 'a'\n   - l (14)\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - The letter 'a' appears 3 times.\n   - The positions of 'a' are 5, 7, and 13.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [5, 7, 13]>>>"
