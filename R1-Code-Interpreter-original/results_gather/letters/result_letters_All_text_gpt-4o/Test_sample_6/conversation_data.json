    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"geographers\" and determine the number of times the letter 'g' appears, as well as the positions of each occurrence. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"geographers\".\n\n2. **Count the 'g's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'g' in the word. Note that the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"geographers\" and note its position.\n   - The word \"geographers\" is composed of the following letters: g, e, o, g, r, a, p, h, e, r, s.\n   - Check each letter to see if it is 'g'.\n   - Record the position of each 'g'.\n\n5. **Positions of 'g'**:\n   - The first 'g' is at position 1.\n   - The second 'g' is at position 4.\n\n6. **Count of 'g'**: There are 2 'g's in the word.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: We have determined the count and positions of 'g' in the word \"geographers\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 2, Positions: [1, 4]>>>."
