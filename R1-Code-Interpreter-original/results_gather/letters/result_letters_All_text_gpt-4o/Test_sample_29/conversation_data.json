    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"ambilateralaterally\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"ambilateralaterally\".\n\n2. **Count the 'a's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'a' in the word. Note that the positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each character in the word and check if it is 'a'.\n   - Keep a count of how many 'a's are found.\n   - Record the position of each 'a'.\n\n5. **Perform the Analysis**:\n   - The word is \"ambilateralaterally\".\n   - Check each character:\n     - 1st character: 'a' (position 2)\n     - 2nd character: 'm'\n     - 3rd character: 'b'\n     - 4th character: 'i'\n     - 5th character: 'l'\n     - 6th character: 'a' (position 6)\n     - 7th character: 't'\n     - 8th character: 'e'\n     - 9th character: 'r'\n     - 10th character: 'a' (position 10)\n     - 11th character: 'l'\n     - 12th character: 'a' (position 12)\n     - 13th character: 't'\n     - 14th character: 'e'\n     - 15th character: 'r'\n     - 16th character: 'a' (position 16)\n     - 17th character: 'l'\n     - 18th character: 'l'\n     - 19th character: 'y'\n   - Total 'a's found: 5\n   - Positions of 'a's: [2, 6, 10, 12, 16]\n\n6. **Final Answer**: We have counted 5 'a's and identified their positions.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 5, Positions: [2, 6, 10, 12, 16]>>>."
