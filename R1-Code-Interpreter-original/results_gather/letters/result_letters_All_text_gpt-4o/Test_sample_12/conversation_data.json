    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"lymphomyxoma\" and determine how many times the letter 'm' appears and at which positions. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"lymphomyxoma\".\n\n2. **Count the 'm's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'm' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'm' in the word. Note that the positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"lymphomyxoma\".\n   - Identify the positions where 'm' appears.\n\n5. **Letter-by-Letter Analysis**:\n   - Position 1: 'l' (not 'm')\n   - Position 2: 'y' (not 'm')\n   - Position 3: 'm' (first 'm' found)\n   - Position 4: 'p' (not 'm')\n   - Position 5: 'h' (not 'm')\n   - Position 6: 'o' (not 'm')\n   - Position 7: 'm' (second 'm' found)\n   - Position 8: 'y' (not 'm')\n   - Position 9: 'x' (not 'm')\n   - Position 10: 'o' (not 'm')\n   - Position 11: 'm' (third 'm' found)\n   - Position 12: 'a' (not 'm')\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - Total 'm's found: 3\n   - Positions of 'm's: 3, 7, 11\n\n7. **Final Answer**: We have found 3 'm's at positions 3, 7, and 11.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 3, Positions: [3, 7, 11]>>>."
