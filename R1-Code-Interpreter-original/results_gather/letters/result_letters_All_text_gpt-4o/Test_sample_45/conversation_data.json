    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"nondilatability\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in it, as well as the positions of these occurrences. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"nondilatability\".\n\n2. **Count the 'y's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'y' in the word. Note that the positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"nondilatability\".\n   - The word is: n, o, n, d, i, l, a, t, a, b, i, l, i, t, y.\n   - Check each letter to see if it is 'y'.\n   - The letter 'y' appears once, at the end of the word.\n\n5. **Position of 'y'**:\n   - The position of 'y' is 14, as it is the 14th letter in the word.\n\n6. **Count of 'y's**:\n   - There is 1 'y' in the word.\n\n7. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Count: 1\n   - Positions: [14]\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the count and positions of 'y' in the word \"nondilatability\".\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Count: 1, Positions: [14]>>>"
