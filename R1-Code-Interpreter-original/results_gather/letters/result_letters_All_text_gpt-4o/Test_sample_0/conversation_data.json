    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"multilingualism\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"multilingualism\".\n\n2. **Count the 'a's**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times the letter 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: As we count the 'a's, we also need to note their positions. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Word**: We will examine each letter in the word \"multilingualism\" one by one:\n\n   - Position 1: 'm'\n   - Position 2: 'u'\n   - Position 3: 'l'\n   - Position 4: 't'\n   - Position 5: 'i'\n   - Position 6: 'l'\n   - Position 7: 'i'\n   - Position 8: 'n'\n   - Position 9: 'g'\n   - Position 10: 'u'\n   - Position 11: 'a' (First occurrence of 'a')\n   - Position 12: 'l'\n   - Position 13: 'i'\n   - Position 14: 's'\n   - Position 15: 'm'\n\n5. **Count and Record**: We found one 'a' at position 11.\n\n6. **Compile Results**: We have counted 1 'a' and its position is 11.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<Count: 1, Positions: [11]>>>"
