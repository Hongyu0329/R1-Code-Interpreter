    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 's' appears in the word \"unseveredness\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"unseveredness\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 's'**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word and count how many times 's' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 's'**:\n   - As we count each 's', note its position in the word. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - Create a list of all the positions where 's' appears.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word \"unseveredness\":\n\n- The word \"unseveredness\" has 13 letters.\n- We will examine each letter in sequence:\n\n  1. u (position 1)\n  2. n (position 2)\n  3. s (position 3) - First 's'\n  4. e (position 4)\n  5. v (position 5)\n  6. e (position 6)\n  7. r (position 7)\n  8. e (position 8)\n  9. d (position 9)\n  10. n (position 10)\n  11. e (position 11)\n  12. s (position 12) - Second 's'\n  13. s (position 13) - Third 's'\n\n- The letter 's' appears 3 times in the word.\n- The positions of 's' are 3, 12, and 13.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [3, 12, 13]>>>"
