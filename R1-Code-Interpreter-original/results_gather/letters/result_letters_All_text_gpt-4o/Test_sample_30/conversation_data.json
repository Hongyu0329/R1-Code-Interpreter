    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"salpingorrhaphy\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"salpingorrhaphy\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to count the occurrences of the letter 'g' and find their positions in the word. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\n3. **Scan the Word**: We will go through each letter in the word \"salpingorrhaphy\" and check if it is 'g'.\n\n4. **Count the 'g's**: As we scan through the word, we will keep a count of how many 'g's we encounter.\n\n5. **Record the Positions**: For each 'g' we find, we will note its position in the word.\n\n6. **Perform the Analysis**:\n   - The word \"salpingorrhaphy\" is 14 letters long.\n   - We will examine each letter one by one:\n     - s (1st position)\n     - a (2nd position)\n     - l (3rd position)\n     - p (4th position)\n     - i (5th position)\n     - n (6th position)\n     - g (7th position) â†’ This is a 'g', so we count it and note the position.\n     - o (8th position)\n     - r (9th position)\n     - r (10th position)\n     - h (11th position)\n     - a (12th position)\n     - p (13th position)\n     - y (14th position)\n\n7. **Count and Positions**:\n   - We found 1 'g' in the word.\n   - The position of 'g' is 7.\n\n8. **Final Answer**: We have determined the count and positions of 'g' in the word.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Count: 1, Positions: [7]>>>."
