    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of occurrences of the letter 'y' in the given word and the positions of each 'y' within the word. The positions should be counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"ybywqyqttohdyyeqbldkren\".\n\n2. **Initialize a counter and a list**: \n   - A counter to keep track of the number of 'y's.\n   - A list to store the positions of each 'y'.\n\n3. **Iterate through the word**:\n   - For each character in the word, check if it is 'y'.\n   - If it is 'y', increment the counter by 1.\n   - Record the position of 'y' in the list. Remember that positions start from 1, so the position is the index of the character in the word plus 1.\n\n4. **Count and record positions**:\n   - Go through each character in the word:\n     - At position 1, the character is 'y'. Increment the counter and record position 1.\n     - At position 3, the character is 'y'. Increment the counter and record position 3.\n     - At position 5, the character is 'y'. Increment the counter and record position 5.\n     - At position 7, the character is 'y'. Increment the counter and record position 7.\n     - At position 12, the character is 'y'. Increment the counter and record position 12.\n     - At position 13, the character is 'y'. Increment the counter and record position 13.\n\n5. **Compile the results**:\n   - The total count of 'y's is 6.\n   - The positions of 'y's are [1, 3, 5, 7, 12, 13].\n\nNow, we can present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Count: 6, Positions: [1, 3, 5, 7, 12, 13]>>>"
