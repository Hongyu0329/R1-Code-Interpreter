    "To solve the problem, we need to determine two things: the number of 's' characters in the given word and their respective positions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word provided is 'uszmesgfrhjwecgpoisssk'.\n\n2. **Count the 's' Characters**: We need to go through each character in the word and count how many times 's' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the Positions**: As we count the 's' characters, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Word**: We will go through each character in the word one by one:\n   - Check if the character is 's'.\n   - If it is, increase the count by 1 and record the position.\n\n5. **List the Positions**: As we find each 's', we will add its position to a list.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will output the count of 's' characters and their positions in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the word 'uszmesgfrhjwecgpoisssk':\n\n- The word is 'uszmesgfrhjwecgpoisssk'.\n- We will check each character:\n  - 1st character: 'u' (not 's')\n  - 2nd character: 's' (count = 1, position = 2)\n  - 3rd character: 'z' (not 's')\n  - 4th character: 'm' (not 's')\n  - 5th character: 'e' (not 's')\n  - 6th character: 's' (count = 2, position = 6)\n  - 7th character: 'g' (not 's')\n  - 8th character: 'f' (not 's')\n  - 9th character: 'r' (not 's')\n  - 10th character: 'h' (not 's')\n  - 11th character: 'j' (not 's')\n  - 12th character: 'w' (not 's')\n  - 13th character: 'e' (not 's')\n  - 14th character: 'c' (not 's')\n  - 15th character: 'g' (not 's')\n  - 16th character: 'p' (not 's')\n  - 17th character: 'o' (not 's')\n  - 18th character: 'i' (not 's')\n  - 19th character: 's' (count = 3, position = 19)\n  - 20th character: 's' (count = 4, position = 20)\n  - 21st character: 's' (count = 5, position = 21)\n  - 22nd character: 'k' (not 's')\n\n- Total count of 's' characters is 5.\n- The positions of 's' are [2, 6, 19, 20, 21].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 5, Positions: [2, 6, 19, 20, 21]>>>"
