    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'a' appears in the word \"preterdiplomatically\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word we are analyzing is \"preterdiplomatically\".\n\n2. **Count the 'a's**: We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times the letter 'a' appears.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: As we count the 'a's, we also need to note their positions. Remember, the position count starts from 1, not 0.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"preterdiplomatically\".\n   - Check if the letter is 'a'.\n   - If it is 'a', note the position (starting from 1) and increase the count by 1.\n\n5. **Perform the Analysis**:\n   - The word \"preterdiplomatically\" has 19 letters.\n   - Go through each letter:\n     - p (1), r (2), e (3), t (4), e (5), r (6), d (7), i (8), p (9), l (10), o (11), m (12), a (13), t (14), i (15), c (16), a (17), l (18), l (19).\n   - The letter 'a' appears at positions 13 and 17.\n\n6. **Count and Positions**:\n   - Total count of 'a's: 2\n   - Positions of 'a's: 13, 17\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [13, 17]>>>"
