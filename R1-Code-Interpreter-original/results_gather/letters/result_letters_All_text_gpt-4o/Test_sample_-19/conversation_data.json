    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"stereoroentgenography\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"stereoroentgenography\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'g'**: \n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'g'**:\n   - As we count the 'g's, we also need to note their positions in the word. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **List the positions**:\n   - As we find each 'g', we record its position.\n\nNow, let's perform the analysis:\n\n- The word \"stereoroentgenography\" is 20 letters long.\n- We will examine each letter in sequence:\n\n  1. s (position 1)\n  2. t (position 2)\n  3. e (position 3)\n  4. r (position 4)\n  5. e (position 5)\n  6. o (position 6)\n  7. r (position 7)\n  8. o (position 8)\n  9. e (position 9)\n  10. n (position 10)\n  11. t (position 11)\n  12. g (position 12) - First 'g' found\n  13. e (position 13)\n  14. n (position 14)\n  15. o (position 15)\n  16. g (position 16) - Second 'g' found\n  17. r (position 17)\n  18. a (position 18)\n  19. p (position 19)\n  20. h (position 20)\n  21. y (position 21)\n\n- We found two 'g's in the word.\n- The positions of 'g' are 12 and 16.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [12, 16]>>>"
