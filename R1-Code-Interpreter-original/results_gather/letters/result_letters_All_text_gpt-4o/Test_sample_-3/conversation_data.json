    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the word \"acetylphenylhydrazine\" and determine how many times the letter 'y' appears and at which positions. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"acetylphenylhydrazine\".\n\n2. **Count the 'y's**: We need to count how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word.\n\n3. **Determine Positions**: We need to find the positions of each 'y' in the word. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Look at each letter in the word \"acetylphenylhydrazine\".\n   - Check if the letter is 'y'.\n   - If it is 'y', note the position.\n\n5. **Detailed Examination**:\n   - The word is: a c e t y l p h e n y l h y d r a z i n e\n   - Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\n6. **Identify 'y' and Positions**:\n   - The first 'y' is at position 5.\n   - The second 'y' is at position 11.\n   - The third 'y' is at position 14.\n\n7. **Count of 'y's**: There are 3 occurrences of the letter 'y'.\n\n8. **Positions of 'y's**: The positions are 5, 11, and 14.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Count: 3, Positions: [5, 11, 14]>>>"
