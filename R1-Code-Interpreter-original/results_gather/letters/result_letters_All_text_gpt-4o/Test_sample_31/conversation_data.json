    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'g' appears in the word \"chemicoengineering\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1, not 0.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"chemicoengineering\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'g'**:\n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'g' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'g'**:\n   - As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the position of each 'g'. Remember, the position starts from 1.\n\n4. **Go through the word**:\n   - The word \"chemicoengineering\" has 17 letters.\n   - Check each letter one by one:\n     - Position 1: 'c'\n     - Position 2: 'h'\n     - Position 3: 'e'\n     - Position 4: 'm'\n     - Position 5: 'i'\n     - Position 6: 'c'\n     - Position 7: 'o'\n     - Position 8: 'e'\n     - Position 9: 'n'\n     - Position 10: 'g' (first occurrence)\n     - Position 11: 'i'\n     - Position 12: 'n'\n     - Position 13: 'e'\n     - Position 14: 'e'\n     - Position 15: 'r'\n     - Position 16: 'i'\n     - Position 17: 'n'\n     - Position 18: 'g' (second occurrence)\n\n5. **Count and list positions**:\n   - The letter 'g' appears 2 times.\n   - The positions of 'g' are 10 and 18.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [10, 18]>>>"
