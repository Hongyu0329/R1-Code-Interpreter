    "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the letter 'y' appears in the word \"cholecystoduodenostomy\" and identify the positions of each occurrence. The positions are counted starting from 1.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"cholecystoduodenostomy\".\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of 'y'**:\n   - We need to go through each letter in the word and count how many times 'y' appears.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of 'y'**:\n   - As we count the occurrences, we also need to note the position of each 'y'. Remember, the position count starts from 1.\n\n4. **Go through the word**:\n   - The word is \"cholecystoduodenostomy\".\n   - Check each letter:\n     - c (1)\n     - h (2)\n     - o (3)\n     - l (4)\n     - e (5)\n     - c (6)\n     - y (7) → First 'y' found at position 7\n     - s (8)\n     - t (9)\n     - o (10)\n     - d (11)\n     - u (12)\n     - o (13)\n     - d (14)\n     - e (15)\n     - n (16)\n     - o (17)\n     - s (18)\n     - t (19)\n     - o (20)\n     - m (21)\n     - y (22) → Second 'y' found at position 22\n\n5. **Count and list positions**:\n   - Total count of 'y': 2\n   - Positions of 'y': 7 and 22\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<Count: 2, Positions: [7, 22]>>>"
