    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is given as:\n\n```\n14, 10, 8, -3\n-4, 13, 8, 11\n-8, -4, -9, 1\n-9, 15, 8, 7\n```\n\nThe average pooling operation involves sliding a 2x2 window across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window, and then forming a new matrix with these averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Initialize the Matrix**: Start by representing the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The window size is 2x2, and it will slide across the matrix.\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n4. **Form the New Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1)x(N-n+1), where N is the original matrix size and n is the window size.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [14, 10, 8, -3],\n    [-4, 13, 8, 11],\n    [-8, -4, -9, 1],\n    [-9, 15, 8, 7]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix to store the averages\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform the average pooling operation\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the new matrix\n        new_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average values for each 2x2 window and store them in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of performing average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n```\n[[8.25, 9.75, 6.0],\n [-0.75, 2.0, 2.75],\n [-1.5, 2.5, 1.75]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix. Each element in the new matrix corresponds to the average of a 2x2 section of the original matrix.\n\n<<<[[8.25, 9.75, 6.0], [-0.75, 2.0, 2.75], [-1.5, 2.5, 1.75]]>>>"
