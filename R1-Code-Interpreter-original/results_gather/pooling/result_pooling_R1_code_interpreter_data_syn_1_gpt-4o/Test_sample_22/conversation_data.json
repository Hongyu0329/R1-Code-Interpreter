    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 sliding window to iterate over the matrix. The window will slide from left to right and top to bottom.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the sliding window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **Result Matrix**: Store the maximum values in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1)x(N-n+1), where N is the size of the original matrix and n is the size of the sliding window.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 3, 20, 3],\n    [6, 17, 12, -7],\n    [17, 20, 17, -2],\n    [16, -9, 0, -7]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the window\n        max_value = max(window)\n        # Store the maximum value in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max_value\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the result of the max pooling operation. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of the max pooling operation on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n<<<17,20,20,20,20,17,20,20,17>>>"
