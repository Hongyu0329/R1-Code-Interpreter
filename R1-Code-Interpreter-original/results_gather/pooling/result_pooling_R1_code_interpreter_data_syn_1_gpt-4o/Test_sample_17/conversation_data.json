    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is given as:\n\n```\n9, 3, -4\n-6, 4, 12\n-10, 12, -4\n```\n\nThe max pooling operation involves sliding a 2x2 window over the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The window slides from left to right and top to bottom, and the maximum values are arranged in a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the sliding windows**: \n   - The first window covers the top-left 2x2 sub-matrix: \n     ```\n     9, 3\n     -6, 4\n     ```\n   - The second window covers the top-right 2x2 sub-matrix:\n     ```\n     3, -4\n     4, 12\n     ```\n   - The third window covers the bottom-left 2x2 sub-matrix:\n     ```\n     -6, 4\n     -10, 12\n     ```\n   - The fourth window covers the bottom-right 2x2 sub-matrix:\n     ```\n     4, 12\n     12, -4\n     ```\n\n2. **Find the maximum value in each window**:\n   - For the first window, the maximum is `9`.\n   - For the second window, the maximum is `12`.\n   - For the third window, the maximum is `12`.\n   - For the fourth window, the maximum is `12`.\n\n3. **Arrange the maximum values in a new matrix**:\n   - The resulting matrix from the max pooling operation will be:\n     ```\n     9, 12\n     12, 12\n     ```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to verify our reasoning:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 3, -4],\n    [-6, 4, 12],\n    [-10, 12, -4]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Resulting matrix dimensions\nresult_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\nresult_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult = np.zeros((result_rows, result_cols), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_rows):\n    for j in range(result_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        result[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches our expectations. The max pooling operation on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window results in the following 2x2 matrix:\n\n<<<9,12,12,12>>>"
