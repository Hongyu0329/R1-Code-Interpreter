    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window at each position. The result will be a new matrix of averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Parse the Input Matrix**: Convert the given string representation of the matrix into a 2D list of integers.\n\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The sliding window is 3x3, and it will slide across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n\n4. **Store the Results**: Store the calculated averages in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix due to the size of the sliding window.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Format the resulting matrix of averages as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [13, -9, -3, 17, 2, -7],\n    [16, 1, 18, 12, -8, 2],\n    [17, -8, -1, 10, 2, 18],\n    [-5, 4, -2, 12, -4, -9],\n    [-2, -4, 6, -1, -5, 4],\n    [3, 7, 11, -6, 0, -3]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = len(matrix[0]) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = [[0] * output_cols for _ in range(output_rows)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 3x3 window\n        window_sum = 0\n        for wi in range(window_size):\n            for wj in range(window_size):\n                window_sum += matrix[i + wi][j + wj]\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output matrix after performing average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window.
