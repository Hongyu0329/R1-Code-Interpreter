    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Define the Matrix**: We have a 5x5 matrix as input.\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The sliding window is 3x3.\n3. **Slide the Window**: Slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom.\n4. **Find Maximum Values**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the window.\n5. **Form the New Matrix**: Arrange these maximum values in a new matrix according to their positions.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nWe'll implement this in Python to compute the result efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 13, 12, 13, -5],\n    [16, 7, 6, 12, 15],\n    [-4, -3, -5, 13, 1],\n    [0, 5, 12, 6, -2],\n    [-5, 17, -10, -8, 7]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = [matrix[x][j:j+window_size] for x in range(i, i+window_size)]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        max_value = max(max(row) for row in window)\n        # Assign the maximum value to the new matrix\n        new_matrix[i][j] = max_value\n\n# Print the new matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 3x3 sliding window on the given 5x5 matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the max pooling operation. The resulting matrix after applying a 3x3 sliding window on the given 5x5 matrix is:\n\n<<<[[16, 13, 15], [16, 13, 15], [17, 17, 13]]>>>"
