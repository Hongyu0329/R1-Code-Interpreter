    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The average pooling operation involves calculating the average of the numbers within each 2x2 window as it slides across the matrix. The resulting averages will form a new matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 window to slide across the matrix. The window will start from the top-left corner and move right and down.\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n4. **Form New Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-1, 11, -10, 8],\n    [8, 13, -9, 13],\n    [-8, 12, 5, 0],\n    [-6, -6, 20, -9]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix to store the averages\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Extract the 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Calculate the average of the window\n        average = sum(window) / len(window)\n        # Store the average in the new matrix\n        new_matrix[i][j] = average\n\n# Print the new matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average values for each 2x2 window and store them in a new matrix. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the new matrix formed by performing average pooling on the original matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Each element in the output matrix represents the average of a 2x2 window from the original matrix.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[7.75, 1.25, 0.5], \n [6.25, 5.25, 2.25], \n [-2.0, 7.75, 4.0]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is smaller than the original 4x4 matrix because the 2x2 window reduces the dimensions by 1 in each direction.\n\n<<<[[7.75, 1.25, 0.5], [6.25, 5.25, 2.25], [-2.0, 7.75, 4.0]]>>>"
