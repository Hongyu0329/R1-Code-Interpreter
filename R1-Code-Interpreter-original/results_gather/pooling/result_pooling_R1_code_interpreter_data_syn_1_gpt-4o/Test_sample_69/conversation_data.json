  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 3*3 sliding window:\n8, 11, 19, 19, 0\n7, 11, 15, 8, 10\n11, 7, 4, 15, 7\n4, -6, -9, 10, 12\n-3, 15, 20, 9, 15\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, and for each position, we will calculate the average of the numbers within the window. The result will be a new matrix of size 3x3, as the window can slide 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically in a 5x5 matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Extract the Matrix**: First, we need to represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The sliding window is 3x3, so we will iterate over possible top-left corners of the window in the matrix.\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n4. **Store the Results**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be the output.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 11, 19, 19, 0],\n    [7, 11, 15, 8, 10],\n    [11, 7, 4, 15, 7],\n    [4, -6, -9, 10, 12],\n    [-3, 15, 20, 9, 15]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the output matrix\noutput_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = [[0] * output_size for _ in range(output_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = [matrix[x][j:j+window_size] for x in range(i, i+window_size)]\n        # Flatten the window and calculate the average\n        window_values = [num for row in window for num in row]\n        average = sum(window_values) / len(window_values)\n        # Store the average in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i][j] = average\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
