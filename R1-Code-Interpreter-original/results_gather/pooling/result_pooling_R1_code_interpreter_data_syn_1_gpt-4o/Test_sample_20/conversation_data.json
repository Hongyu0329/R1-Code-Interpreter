    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: We have a 4x4 matrix:\n   ```\n   1, -3, -9, 4\n   -3, 15, -5, 2\n   -5, 5, 2, 10\n   -4, 6, 12, 13\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a 2x2 window. This means we will slide the window across the matrix, both horizontally and vertically, to cover all possible 2x2 submatrices.\n\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each 2x2 submatrix, we find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the new matrix.\n\n4. **Resulting Matrix**: The resulting matrix will be of size (4-2+1)x(4-2+1) = 3x3.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, -3, -9, 4],\n    [-3, 15, -5, 2],\n    [-5, 5, 2, 10],\n    [-4, 6, 12, 13]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the resulting matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of performing max pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting 3x3 matrix is:\n\n```\n[[15, 15, 4],\n [15, 15, 10],\n [6, 12, 13]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the maximum values found in each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix.\n\n<<<15,15,4,15,15,10,6,12,13>>>"
