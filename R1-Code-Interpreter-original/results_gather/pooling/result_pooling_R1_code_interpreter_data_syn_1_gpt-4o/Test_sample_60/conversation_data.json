    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is given as:\n\n```\n19, 14, 3, 6\n5, 12, 7, -2\n-8, 13, -2, 20\n11, 10, -4, -10\n```\n\nThe average pooling operation involves sliding a 2x2 window over the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window, and then forming a new matrix with these averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. **Form New Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-1)x(N-1) since the window is 2x2.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [19, 14, 3, 6],\n    [5, 12, 7, -2],\n    [-8, 13, -2, 20],\n    [11, 10, -4, -10]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix to store the averages\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform the average pooling operation\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the new matrix\n        new_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the new matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average values for each 2x2 window and store them in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of performing average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n```\n[[12.5, 9.0, 3.5],\n [5.5, 7.5, 5.75],\n [6.5, 4.25, 1.0]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix. Each element in the new matrix corresponds to the average of a 2x2 section of the original matrix.\n\n<<<12.5,9.0,3.5,5.5,7.5,5.75,6.5,4.25,1.0>>>"
