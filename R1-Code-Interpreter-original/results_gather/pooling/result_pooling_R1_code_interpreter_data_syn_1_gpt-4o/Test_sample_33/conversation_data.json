    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: We have a 4x4 matrix:\n   ```\n   17, 10, 6, 10\n   0, -5, 16, 16\n   0, 8, 0, 19\n   -2, 17, -8, 11\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a 2x2 window to slide across the matrix. The window will slide from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n3. **Max Pooling Operation**:\n   - For each position of the 2x2 window, find the maximum value.\n   - The window will slide across the matrix, and we will collect the maximum values to form a new matrix.\n\n4. **Resulting Matrix**: The resulting matrix will be smaller than the original matrix. Since we are using a 2x2 window on a 4x4 matrix, the resulting matrix will be 3x3.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the resulting matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [17, 10, 6, 10],\n    [0, -5, 16, 16],\n    [0, 8, 0, 19],\n    [-2, 17, -8, 11]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the resulting matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the resulting matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the resulting matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n<<<17,16,16,8,16,19,17,17,19>>>"
