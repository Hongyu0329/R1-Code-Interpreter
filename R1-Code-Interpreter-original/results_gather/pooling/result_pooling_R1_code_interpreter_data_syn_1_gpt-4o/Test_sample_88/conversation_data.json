    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window at each position. The result will be a new matrix of averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 3x3 window within the 6x6 matrix, calculate the average of the numbers in the window.\n3. **Result Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix. Since the original matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the resulting matrix will be (6-3+1)x(6-3+1) = 4x4.\n4. **Output the Result**: Format the result matrix as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original 6x6 matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 4, 11, -2, -10, 8],\n    [0, 5, 3, 15, -7, 10],\n    [20, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6],\n    [14, 9, -5, 10, 6, 17],\n    [-7, 17, 4, -3, 20, 0],\n    [8, 9, 13, -10, -2, 11]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform the average pooling operation\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 3x3 window\n        window_sum = 0\n        for wi in range(window_size):\n            for wj in range(window_size):\n                window_sum += matrix[i + wi][j + wj]\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 3x3 window in the 6x6 matrix and store the results in a 4x4 matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output, which is the result of performing average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window.
