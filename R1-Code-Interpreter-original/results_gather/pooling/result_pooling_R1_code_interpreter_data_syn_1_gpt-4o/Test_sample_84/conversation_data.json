    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window at each position. The result will be a new matrix of size 3x3, as the window can slide across the original matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Extract the Matrix**: First, we need to represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The sliding window is 3x3, and it will slide across the 5x5 matrix.\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the numbers within the window.\n4. **Store the Results**: Store the calculated averages in a new matrix of size 3x3.\n5. **Output the Result**: Format the result as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original 5x5 matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-7, -5, 19, -10, 12],\n    [4, 0, -7, 2, -10],\n    [11, -5, -4, 11, 6],\n    [2, 10, -7, -4, 18],\n    [6, 13, 5, 6, 2]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the output matrix\noutput_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = [[0] * output_size for _ in range(output_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = [matrix[x][j:j+window_size] for x in range(i, i+window_size)]\n        # Flatten the window and calculate the average\n        window_values = [num for row in window for num in row]\n        average = sum(window_values) / len(window_values)\n        # Store the average in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i][j] = average\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a 3x3 matrix representing the average values calculated from the 3x3 sliding window applied to the original 5x5 matrix. Each element in the output matrix corresponds to the average of the numbers within the sliding window at that position.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[0.6666666666666666, 0.1111111111111111, 2.111111111111111],\n [0.4444444444444444, -0.4444444444444444, 0.5555555555555556],\n [3.4444444444444446, 2.7777777777777777, 3.6666666666666665]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 3x3 window as it slides across the original matrix. The values are calculated by summing the elements within each window and dividing by the number of elements (9 in this case).\n\n<<<[[0.6666666666666666, 0.1111111111111111, 2.111111111111111], [0.4444444444444444, -0.4444444444444444, 0.5555555555555556], [3.4444444444444446, 2.7777777777777777, 3.6666666666666665]]>>>"
