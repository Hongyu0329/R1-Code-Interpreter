We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n11, 4, -7, -9\n3, -10, 2, 9\n-7, 5, -8, 13\n17, 1, 5, -9\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is given as:\n\n```\n11, 4, -7, -9\n3, -10, 2, 9\n-7, 5, -8, 13\n17, 1, 5, -9\n```\n\nThe average pooling operation involves sliding a 2x2 window over the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window, and then forming a new matrix with these averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: Slide a 2x2 window over the matrix, calculate the average of the elements within each window, and store these averages in a new matrix.\n3. **Output the Result**: The resulting matrix will be smaller than the original matrix. For a 4x4 matrix with a 2x2 window, the resulting matrix will be 3x3.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [11, 4, -7, -9],\n    [3, -10, 2, 9],\n    [-7, 5, -8, 13],\n    [17, 1, 5, -9]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nN = 4\n\n# Size of the sliding window\nn = 2\n\n# Resulting matrix dimensions\nresult_dim = N - n + 1\n\n# Initialize the resulting matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_dim for _ in range(result_dim)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_dim):\n    for j in range(result_dim):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average\n        result_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (n * n)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average of each 2x2 window and store the results in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a 3x3 matrix representing the average values of each 2x2 sliding window from the original 4x4 matrix. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the result:\n\n- The first element `2.0` is the average of the first 2x2 window: `[(11, 4), (3, -10)]`.\n- The second element `-2.75` is the average of the second 2x2 window: `[(4, -7), (-10, 2)]`.\n- The third element `-1.25` is the average of the third 2x2 window: `[(-7, -9), (2, 9)]`.\n- This pattern continues for the rest of the matrix.\n\nThe final result of the average pooling operation is:\n\n<<<[[2.0, -2.75, -1.25], [-2.25, -2.75, 4.0], [4.0, 0.75, 0.25]]>>>"
