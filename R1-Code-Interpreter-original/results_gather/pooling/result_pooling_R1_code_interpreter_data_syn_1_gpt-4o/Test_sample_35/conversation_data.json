    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding a smaller window over the matrix and taking the maximum value from each window position to form a new matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 window to slide over the matrix. The window will start from the top-left corner and move right and down.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **New Matrix Formation**: Store these maximum values in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, -6, -9, -8],\n    [2, 7, 4, 16],\n    [5, 19, -6, 11],\n    [20, 14, -8, 4]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nN = 4\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nn = 2\n\n# Resultant matrix after max pooling\nresult = []\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(N - n + 1):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(N - n + 1):\n        # Extract the 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the window\n        max_value = max(window)\n        row.append(max_value)\n    result.append(row)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window on the given 4x4 matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of performing max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[7, 7, 16], \n [19, 19, 16], \n [20, 19, 11]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the maximum values found in each 2x2 window as it slides across the original 4x4 matrix.\n\n<<<[[7, 7, 16], [19, 19, 16], [20, 19, 11]]>>>"
