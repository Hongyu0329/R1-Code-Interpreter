    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window at each position. The result will be a new matrix of averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 3x3 window within the 6x6 matrix, calculate the average of the numbers in the window.\n3. **Result Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (6-3+1)x(6-3+1) = 4x4.\n4. **Output the Result**: Format the result matrix as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-4, 10, 7, 14, 6, 5],\n    [-5, 13, -3, -5, 1, 11],\n    [-1, 5, 19, 5, 16, 15],\n    [9, 0, -8, 19, 6, 6],\n    [1, 12, 8, 3, -10, 15],\n    [-5, 14, 18, 16, -6, 14]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the result matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 3x3 window\n        window_sum = 0\n        for wi in range(window_size):\n            for wj in range(window_size):\n                window_sum += matrix[i + wi][j + wj]\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average of each 3x3 window in the 6x6 matrix and store the results in a 4x4 matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
