    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n7, -9, 2\n-5, 11, -3\n8, 7, 18\n```\n\nWe will slide a 2x2 window across this matrix. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Start with the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the 2x2 window across the matrix.\n2. For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the window.\n3. Store these maximum values in a new matrix.\n\nThe sliding window positions and their corresponding maximum values are:\n- Top-left (0,0) to (1,1): max(7, -9, -5, 11) = 11\n- Top-middle (0,1) to (1,2): max(-9, 2, 11, -3) = 11\n- Middle-left (1,0) to (2,1): max(-5, 11, 8, 7) = 11\n- Middle-middle (1,1) to (2,2): max(11, -3, 7, 18) = 18\n\nThe resulting matrix after max pooling is:\n```\n11, 11\n11, 18\n```\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, -9, 2],\n    [-5, 11, -3],\n    [8, 7, 18]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n```\n[[11 11]\n [11 18]]\n```\n\nThis confirms that the max pooling operation was performed correctly on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window.\n\n<<<11, 11, 11, 18>>>"
