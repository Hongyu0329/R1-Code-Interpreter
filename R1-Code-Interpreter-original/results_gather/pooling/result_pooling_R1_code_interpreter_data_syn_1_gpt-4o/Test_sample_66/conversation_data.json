    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The average pooling operation involves calculating the average of the numbers within each 2x2 window as it slides across the matrix. The resulting averages will form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. **Resultant Matrix Construction**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1) x (N-n+1), where N is the size of the original matrix and n is the size of the sliding window.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n8, 8, 9, -3\n14, 10, 12, -9\n18, 11, 8, -10\n18, 18, 6, 19\n```\n\nWe will perform the average pooling with a 2x2 window. Let's write the code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 8, 9, -3],\n    [14, 10, 12, -9],\n    [18, 11, 8, -10],\n    [18, 18, 6, 19]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix to store the averages\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the new matrix\n        new_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
