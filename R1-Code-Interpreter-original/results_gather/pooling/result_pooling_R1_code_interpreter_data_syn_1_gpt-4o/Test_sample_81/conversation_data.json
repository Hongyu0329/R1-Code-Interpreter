    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The average pooling operation involves calculating the average of the numbers within each 3x3 window as it slides across the matrix. The result will be a new matrix of size (5-3+1)x(5-3+1) = 3x3, where each element is the average of the corresponding 3x3 window from the original matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Extract the 5x5 matrix**: We need to parse the input to form the matrix.\n2. **Initialize the result matrix**: This will be a 3x3 matrix to store the averages.\n3. **Slide the 3x3 window**: Iterate over the possible top-left corners of the 3x3 window in the 5x5 matrix.\n4. **Calculate the average**: For each position of the window, calculate the average of the 9 elements within the window.\n5. **Store the result**: Place the calculated average in the corresponding position in the result matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the 5x5 matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [15, 5, 7, 1, -6],\n    [-10, 19, 14, 0, 0],\n    [-5, 16, 15, -9, 16],\n    [12, -3, 3, 9, 12],\n    [9, 7, 8, 16, -2]\n]\n\n# Size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the result matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the 3x3 window\n        window = [matrix[x][j:j+window_size] for x in range(i, i+window_size)]\n        # Flatten the window and calculate the average\n        window_elements = [element for row in window for element in row]\n        average = sum(window_elements) / len(window_elements)\n        # Store the average in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = average\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window and output the resulting 3x3 matrix.",
