    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window at each position. The result will be a new matrix of size (6-3+1)x(6-3+1) = 4x4, as the window can slide 4 times horizontally and 4 times vertically.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Matrix**: Start with the given 6x6 matrix.\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The window size is 3x3.\n3. **Slide the Window**: Move the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom.\n4. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n5. **Store the Results**: Store these averages in a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the original 6x6 matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [-8, 1, 1, -8, 5, -7],\n    [4, 10, 19, 11, 17, 15],\n    [5, 10, 5, -10, 13, -2],\n    [-4, -10, 2, -9, 15, -8],\n    [12, 11, 11, -7, 11, 14],\n    [13, -9, 10, 5, -6, 10]\n])\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the output matrix\noutput_size = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_size, output_size))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the window\n        window_average = np.mean(window)\n        # Store the result in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = window_average\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window and output the resulting 4x4 matrix.",
