    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: We have a 4x4 matrix:\n   ```\n   11, 15, 18, 18\n   20, -8, -4, 19\n   14, -9, 11, -7\n   -9, 2, -7, 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a 2x2 window. The window will slide across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, we find the maximum value and store it in a new matrix.\n\n4. **New Matrix Dimensions**: Since the original matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the resulting matrix will be (4-2+1)x(4-2+1) = 3x3.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the max pooled matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [11, 15, 18, 18],\n    [20, -8, -4, 19],\n    [14, -9, 11, -7],\n    [-9, 2, -7, 2]\n])\n\n# Dimensions\nN = 4\nn = 2\n\n# Resulting matrix dimensions\nresult_dim = N - n + 1\nresult_matrix = np.zeros((result_dim, result_dim), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_dim):\n    for j in range(result_dim):\n        # Extract the 2x2 window\n        window = matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n]\n        # Find the maximum value in the window\n        max_value = np.max(window)\n        # Store the maximum value in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i, j] = max_value\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window on the given 4x4 matrix. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of performing max pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting 3x3 matrix is:\n\n```\n[[20 18 19]\n [20 11 19]\n [14 11 11]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the maximum values found in each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix.\n\n<<<20,18,19;20,11,19;14,11,11>>>"
