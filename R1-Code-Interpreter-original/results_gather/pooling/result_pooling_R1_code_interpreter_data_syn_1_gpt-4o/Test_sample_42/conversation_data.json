    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 3x3 window to slide over the matrix. The window will start from the top-left corner and move right until it reaches the end of the row, then move down one row and repeat.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 3x3 window.\n4. **Result Matrix**: Store these maximum values in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix.\n\nThe resulting matrix will have dimensions of (5-3+1)x(5-3+1) = 3x3.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, -7, -6, 6, 0],\n    [-8, 13, -2, 8, -7],\n    [20, 9, -8, 17, 3],\n    [11, -8, 19, 14, 3],\n    [-3, 15, 0, 8, 9]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = [matrix[x][j:j+window_size] for x in range(i, i+window_size)]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        max_value = max(max(row) for row in window)\n        # Store the maximum value in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max_value\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the result of the max pooling operation. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of the max pooling operation on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n<<<[[20, 17, 17], [20, 19, 19], [20, 19, 19]]>>>"
