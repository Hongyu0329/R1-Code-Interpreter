    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The average pooling operation involves calculating the average of the numbers within each 2x2 window as it slides across the matrix. The result will be a new matrix with dimensions reduced by the size of the sliding window.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: We have a 4x4 matrix:\n   ```\n   8, 10, -6, -7\n   0, 10, 2, 19\n   4, 3, -5, -10\n   2, 2, -1, -9\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a 2x2 sliding window. This means we will calculate the average of each 2x2 sub-matrix.\n\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The resulting matrix will be 3x3 because the sliding window reduces the dimensions by 1 in each direction (4-2+1 = 3).\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 10, -6, -7],\n    [0, 10, 2, 19],\n    [4, 3, -5, -10],\n    [2, 2, -1, -9]\n])\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the current window\n        window_average = np.mean(window)\n        # Store the result in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = window_average\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 2x2 window and store the results in a new matrix. Let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of performing average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The output matrix is a 3x3 matrix, where each element represents the average of a 2x2 sub-matrix from the original matrix.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[ 7.    4.    2.  ]\n [ 4.25  2.5   1.5 ]\n [ 2.75 -0.25 -6.25]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix.\n\n<<<[[7.0, 4.0, 2.0], [4.25, 2.5, 1.5], [2.75, -0.25, -6.25]]>>>"
