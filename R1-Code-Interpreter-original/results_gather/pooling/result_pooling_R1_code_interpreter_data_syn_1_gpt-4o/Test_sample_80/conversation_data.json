  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 3*3 sliding window:\n0, 5, 3, 10, -7\n-10, -3, 11, -3, 19\n-3, 2, 5, -5, -1\n2, -9, 12, 8, 5\n3, 18, -6, 6, 15\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, and for each position, we will calculate the average of the numbers within the window. The result will be a new matrix of averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Parse the Input Matrix**: Convert the given matrix into a 2D list for easier manipulation.\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The window size is 3x3, and it will slide across the matrix.\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each valid position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the numbers within the window.\n4. **Store the Results**: Store these averages in a new matrix.\n5. **Output the Result**: Format the result as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 5, 3, 10, -7],\n    [-10, -3, 11, -3, 19],\n    [-3, 2, 5, -5, -1],\n    [2, -9, 12, 8, 5],\n    [3, 18, -6, 6, 15]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = len(matrix[0]) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = []\n\n# Perform the average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = [matrix[i+x][j+y] for x in range(window_size) for y in range(window_size)]\n        # Calculate the average of the current window\n        average = sum(window) / (window_size * window_size)\n        row.append(average)\n    output_matrix.append(row)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
