    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, and for each position, we will calculate the average of the numbers within the window. The result will be a new matrix of averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: Use a 3x3 window to slide over the matrix. The window will start from the top-left corner and move right until it reaches the end of the row, then move down one row and repeat.\n3. **Average Calculation**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n4. **Result Matrix**: Store the calculated averages in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix due to the size of the sliding window.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, -2, 10, 3, 3],\n    [1, 3, 9, 15, 16],\n    [20, 20, 6, 13, 15],\n    [5, -3, 19, -1, 14],\n    [7, 19, 4, 1, 16]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\nN = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = []\n\n# Perform the average pooling\nfor i in range(N - window_size + 1):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(N - window_size + 1):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 3x3 window\n        window_sum = 0\n        for wi in range(window_size):\n            for wj in range(window_size):\n                window_sum += matrix[i + wi][j + wj]\n        # Calculate the average\n        window_average = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n        row.append(window_average)\n    result_matrix.append(row)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
