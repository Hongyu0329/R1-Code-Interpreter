    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, we need to represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: We will slide a 2x2 window across the matrix. The window will start from the top-left corner and move right and then down.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, we will find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **Result Matrix**: The maximum values will be stored in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n19, 11, -6, -6\n11, 2, 8, 2\n6, 20, 12, 10\n-10, -8, 13, 14\n```\n\nWe will perform the max pooling operation using a 2x2 window. Let's write the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [19, 11, -6, -6],\n    [11, 2, 8, 2],\n    [6, 20, 12, 10],\n    [-10, -8, 13, 14]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of the max pooling operation on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n```\n[[19, 11, 8],\n [20, 20, 12],\n [20, 20, 14]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix.\n\n<<<[[19, 11, 8], [20, 20, 12], [20, 20, 14]]>>>"
