    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 window to slide across the matrix. The window will start at the top-left corner and move right and down.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **Result Matrix**: Store the maximum values in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix.\n\nThe original matrix is:\n```\n9, -9, 4, -3\n-1, -8, 15, 7\n11, 13, -9, 17\n20, 15, 20, -7\n```\n\nThe resulting matrix after max pooling with a 2x2 window will be a 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, -9, 4, -3],\n    [-1, -8, 15, 7],\n    [11, 13, -9, 17],\n    [20, 15, 20, -7]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nN = 4\n\n# Size of the sliding window\nn = 2\n\n# Resultant matrix after max pooling\nresult = []\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(N - n + 1):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(N - n + 1):\n        # Extract the 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the window\n        max_value = max(window)\n        row.append(max_value)\n    result.append(row)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix and print it. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of the max pooling operation on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n<<<[[9, 15, 15], [13, 15, 17], [20, 20, 20]]>>>"
