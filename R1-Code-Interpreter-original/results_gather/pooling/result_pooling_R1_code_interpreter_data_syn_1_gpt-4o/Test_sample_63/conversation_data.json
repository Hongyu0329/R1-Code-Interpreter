Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n20, 8, 7, -1\n12, 3, -2, -3\n5, 4, 18, -10\n2, 10, -7, 6\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The average pooling operation involves calculating the average of the numbers within each 2x2 window as it slides across the matrix. The result will be a new matrix that is smaller than the original, specifically a 3x3 matrix in this case, since the window reduces the dimensions by 1 in each direction.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. **Store Results**: Store these averages in a new matrix.\n4. **Output the Result**: Format the result as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [20, 8, 7, -1],\n    [12, 3, -2, -3],\n    [5, 4, 18, -10],\n    [2, 10, -7, 6]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = [[0] * output_size for _ in range(output_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average\n        window_average = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n        # Store the average in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i][j] = window_average\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 2x2 window and store the results in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of performing average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window.
