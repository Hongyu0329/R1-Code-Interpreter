We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n-8, -6, 2, 18\n3, 13, 20, 9\n-8, -6, 0, -4\n-10, -4, 10, 10\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is given as:\n\n```\n-8, -6, 2, 18\n3, 13, 20, 9\n-8, -6, 0, -4\n-10, -4, 10, 10\n```\n\nThe steps to perform average pooling are as follows:\n\n1. **Initialize the Matrix**: First, we need to represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The sliding window is 2x2, which means we will calculate the average of each 2x2 sub-matrix.\n\n3. **Slide the Window**: We will slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom. For a 4x4 matrix with a 2x2 window, the resulting matrix will be 3x3 because the window can slide 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n5. **Store the Result**: Store the calculated averages in a new matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-8, -6, 2, 18],\n    [3, 13, 20, 9],\n    [-8, -6, 0, -4],\n    [-10, -4, 10, 10]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Calculate the average\n        average = sum(window) / len(window)\n        # Store the average in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = average\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is a 3x3 matrix representing the average values obtained from the 2x2 sliding window applied to the original 4x4 matrix. Each element in the resulting matrix is the average of a 2x2 sub-matrix from the original matrix.\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n```\n[[0.5, 7.25, 12.25],\n [0.5, 6.75, 6.25],\n [-7.0, 0.0, 4.0]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of the average pooling operation. Each value corresponds to the average of a 2x2 section of the original matrix, calculated as the window slides across the matrix.\n\n<<<[[0.5, 7.25, 12.25], [0.5, 6.75, 6.25], [-7.0, 0.0, 4.0]]>>>"
