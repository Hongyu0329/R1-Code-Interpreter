  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n10, 11, -2, 1\n5, 18, 18, 18\n-9, -1, 7, 11\n12, -1, -4, 14\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n\n3. **Resultant Matrix Construction**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1) x (N-n+1), where N is the size of the original matrix and n is the size of the sliding window.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Format the resultant matrix as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [10, 11, -2, 1],\n    [5, 18, 18, 18],\n    [-9, -1, 7, 11],\n    [12, -1, -4, 14]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix to store the averages\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform the average pooling operation\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the elements in the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the new matrix\n        new_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the new matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average values for each 2x2 window and store them in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of performing average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The output matrix is a 3x3 matrix, as expected, since the original matrix is 4x4 and the sliding window is 2x2.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[11.0, 11.25, 8.75],\n [3.25, 10.5, 13.5],\n [0.25, 0.25, 7.0]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix.\n\n<<<11.0, 11.25, 8.75, 3.25, 10.5, 13.5, 0.25, 0.25, 7.0>>>"
