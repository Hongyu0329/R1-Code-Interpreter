    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window at each position. The result will be a new matrix of averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 3x3 window within the 6x6 matrix, calculate the average of the numbers in the window.\n3. **Result Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix. Since the window is 3x3, the resulting matrix will be of size (6-3+1)x(6-3+1) = 4x4.\n4. **Output the Result**: Format the result matrix as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original 6x6 matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 4, 11, 15, 18, 2],\n    [14, 3, 1, 0, 19, 11],\n    [5, 8, 14, -8, -10, 15],\n    [-7, -9, 9, -8, 9, -6],\n    [20, 5, 9, 1, 8, 19],\n    [16, 12, -10, 2, 6, -1]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform the average pooling operation\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 3x3 window\n        window_sum = 0\n        for wi in range(window_size):\n            for wj in range(window_size):\n                window_sum += matrix[i + wi][j + wj]\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average values for each 3x3 window in the matrix and store them in a new 4x4 matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the average pooling operation using a 3x3 sliding window on the given 6x6 matrix. The result is a 4x4 matrix where each element represents the average of a 3x3 window from the original matrix.\n\nNow, let's format the result matrix as specified in the problem statement.\n\n<<<7.444444444444445,5.333333333333333,6.666666666666667,6.888888888888889;4.222222222222222,1.1111111111111112,2.888888888888889,2.4444444444444446;6.0,2.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,2.2222222222222223;5.0,1.2222222222222223,2.888888888888889,3.3333333333333335>>>"
