    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is given as:\n\n```\n-6, 12, 13\n-5, -3, 8\n4, 8, 18\n```\n\nThe max pooling operation involves sliding a 2x2 window over the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The window slides from left to right and top to bottom, and the maximum values are arranged in a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Slide a 2x2 window over the matrix. For a 3x3 matrix, the window can be positioned at the following top-left corners:\n   - (0,0)\n   - (0,1)\n   - (1,0)\n   - (1,1)\n3. **Max Calculation**: For each window position, calculate the maximum value.\n4. **Result Matrix**: Arrange these maximum values in a new matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-6, 12, 13],\n    [-5, -3, 8],\n    [4, 8, 18]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult = []\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(len(matrix) - window_size + 1):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(len(matrix[0]) - window_size + 1):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        max_value = max(window)\n        row.append(max_value)\n    result.append(row)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooling result for the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output `[[12, 13], [8, 18]]`. This output represents the result of the max pooling operation on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the result:\n\n- The first 2x2 window (top-left corner at (0,0)) contains the elements `[-6, 12, -5, -3]`. The maximum value is `12`.\n- The second 2x2 window (top-left corner at (0,1)) contains the elements `[12, 13, -3, 8]`. The maximum value is `13`.\n- The third 2x2 window (top-left corner at (1,0)) contains the elements `[-5, -3, 4, 8]`. The maximum value is `8`.\n- The fourth 2x2 window (top-left corner at (1,1)) contains the elements `[-3, 8, 8, 18]`. The maximum value is `18`.\n\nThese maximum values are arranged in a new 2x2 matrix as `[[12, 13], [8, 18]]`.\n\n<<<[[12, 13], [8, 18]]>>>"
