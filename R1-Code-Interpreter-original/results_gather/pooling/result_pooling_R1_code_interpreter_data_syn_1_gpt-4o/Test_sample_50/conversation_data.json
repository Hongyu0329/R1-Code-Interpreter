We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n2, -7, -10, 1\n14, 5, 18, -5\n7, 7, 18, -9\n9, 9, 10, -5\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is given as:\n\n```\n2, -7, -10, 1\n14, 5, 18, -5\n7, 7, 18, -9\n9, 9, 10, -5\n```\n\nThe average pooling operation involves sliding a 2x2 window over the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window, and then forming a new matrix with these averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. **Form New Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1)x(N-n+1), where N is the original matrix size and n is the window size.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, -7, -10, 1],\n    [14, 5, 18, -5],\n    [7, 7, 18, -9],\n    [9, 9, 10, -5]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average\n        new_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the new matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 2x2 window and store it in the new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of performing average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The new matrix, which contains the average values of each 2x2 window, is:\n\n<<<3.5, 1.5, 1.0\n8.25, 12.0, 5.5\n8.0, 11.0, 3.5>>>"
