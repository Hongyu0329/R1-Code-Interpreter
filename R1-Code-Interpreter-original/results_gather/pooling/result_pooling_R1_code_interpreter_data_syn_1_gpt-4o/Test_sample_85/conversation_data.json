  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 3*3 sliding window:\n-9, 20, -4, 6, -9\n-2, 10, 14, 19, 0\n-3, 12, 15, 7, -10\n6, -9, 17, 7, 11\n8, 2, 6, -9, -5\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The average pooling operation involves calculating the average of the numbers within each 3x3 window as it slides across the matrix. The result will be a new matrix of size 3x3, as the sliding window will have 3 possible positions in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 3x3 window, calculate the average of the numbers within the window.\n\n3. **Store Results**: Store the calculated averages in a new matrix.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Format the result as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the average pooling:\n\n```python\n# Define the original 5x5 matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-9, 20, -4, 6, -9],\n    [-2, 10, 14, 19, 0],\n    [-3, 12, 15, 7, -10],\n    [6, -9, 17, 7, 11],\n    [8, 2, 6, -9, -5]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the output matrix\noutput_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = [[0] * output_size for _ in range(output_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the 3x3 window\n        window = [matrix[x][j:j+window_size] for x in range(i, i+window_size)]\n        # Flatten the window and calculate the average\n        window_values = [value for row in window for value in row]\n        average = sum(window_values) / len(window_values)\n        # Store the average in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i][j] = average\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 3x3 window and store the results in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
