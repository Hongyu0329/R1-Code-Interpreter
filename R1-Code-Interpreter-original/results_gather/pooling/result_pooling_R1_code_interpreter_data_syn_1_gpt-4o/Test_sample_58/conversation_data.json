    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is given as:\n\n```\n-10, 9, -6, -2\n-9, 9, 7, 15\n12, -3, -10, 7\n5, 3, 17, 9\n```\n\nThe average pooling operation involves sliding a 2x2 window across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window, and then forming a new matrix with these averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Initialize the Matrix**: Start by representing the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Define the Sliding Window**: The window size is 2x2, and it will slide across the matrix.\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n4. **Form the New Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1)x(N-n+1), where N is the original matrix size and n is the window size.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-10, 9, -6, -2],\n    [-9, 9, 7, 15],\n    [12, -3, -10, 7],\n    [5, 3, 17, 9]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix to store the averages\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform the average pooling operation\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Extract the 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Calculate the average of the window\n        average = sum(window) / len(window)\n        # Store the average in the new matrix\n        new_matrix[i][j] = average\n\n# Print the new matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average values for each 2x2 window and store them in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of performing average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The new matrix, which is a 3x3 matrix, contains the average values of each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[-0.25, 4.75, 3.5],\n [2.25, 0.75, 4.75],\n [4.25, 1.75, 5.75]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values calculated from each 2x2 window in the original matrix.\n\n<<<[-0.25, 4.75, 3.5], [2.25, 0.75, 4.75], [4.25, 1.75, 5.75]>>>"
