    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The matrix is:\n\n```\n-1, 7, 20\n6, 16, -4\n9, 13, 7\n```\n\nThe max pooling operation involves sliding a 2x2 window over the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The window slides from left to right and top to bottom, and the maximum values are used to form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the sliding windows**: \n   - The first window covers the top-left 2x2 sub-matrix.\n   - The second window slides to the right, covering the top-right 2x2 sub-matrix.\n   - The third window slides down, covering the bottom-left 2x2 sub-matrix.\n   - The fourth window slides to the right, covering the bottom-right 2x2 sub-matrix.\n\n2. **Calculate the maximum for each window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, find the maximum value.\n\n3. **Form the new matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in the same order as the windows were processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [-1, 7, 20],\n    [6, 16, -4],\n    [9, 13, 7]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooling result for the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n```\n[[16 20]\n [16 16]]\n```\n\nThis result is obtained by sliding a 2x2 window over the original 3x3 matrix and taking the maximum value from each window. The windows and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n1. **Top-left window**: \n   ```\n   -1, 7\n   6, 16\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 16\n\n2. **Top-right window**:\n   ```\n   7, 20\n   16, -4\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 20\n\n3. **Bottom-left window**:\n   ```\n   6, 16\n   9, 13\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 16\n\n4. **Bottom-right window**:\n   ```\n   16, -4\n   13, 7\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 16\n\nThese maximum values are arranged in the output matrix as shown above.\n\n<<<[[16, 20], [16, 16]]>>>"
