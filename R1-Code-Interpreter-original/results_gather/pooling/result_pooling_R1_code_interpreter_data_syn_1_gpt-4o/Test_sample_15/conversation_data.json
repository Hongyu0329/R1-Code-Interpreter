    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n9, -5, -5\n-5, 6, 1\n19, 16, 12\n```\n\nWe will slide a 2x2 window across this matrix. The window will start at the top-left corner and move right and down. For each position of the window, we will find the maximum value and store it in a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Start with the top-left 2x2 window: \n   ```\n   9, -5\n   -5, 6\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n2. Move the window one step to the right:\n   ```\n   -5, -5\n   6, 1\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 6.\n\n3. Move the window down to the next row:\n   ```\n   -5, 6\n   19, 16\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 19.\n\n4. Move the window one step to the right:\n   ```\n   6, 1\n   16, 12\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 16.\n\nThe resulting matrix from the max pooling operation will be:\n```\n9, 6\n19, 16\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to verify our results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, -5, -5],\n    [-5, 6, 1],\n    [19, 16, 12]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n```\n[[ 9  6]\n [19 16]]\n```\n\nThis confirms that the max pooling operation was performed correctly on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window.\n\n<<<9,6,19,16>>>"
