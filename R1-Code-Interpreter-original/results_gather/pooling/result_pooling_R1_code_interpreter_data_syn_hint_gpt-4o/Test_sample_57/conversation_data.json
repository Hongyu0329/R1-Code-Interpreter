    "To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to calculate the average of each 2x2 sub-matrix as the window slides across the original matrix. The resulting matrix will be a 3x3 matrix because the window can slide across three positions horizontally and three positions vertically.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the 2x2 sub-matrices**: \n   - The top-left corner of each 2x2 sub-matrix will be the starting point for calculating the average.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix, the top-left corners of the 2x2 sub-matrices will be at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\n2. **Calculate the average for each 2x2 sub-matrix**:\n   - For each sub-matrix, sum the four elements and divide by 4 to get the average.\n\n3. **Store the averages in a new 3x3 matrix**.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the averages and form the new matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original 4x4 matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [17, 8, 5, 8],\n    [10, -6, -6, 4],\n    [0, 4, 16, -9],\n    [17, 7, 6, -8]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_size, output_size))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the window\n        window_average = np.mean(window)\n        # Store the average in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = window_average\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 2x2 sub-matrix and store the results in a new 3x3 matrix. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average pooling operation was performed correctly, and the resulting 3x3 matrix was computed without any errors. The averages were calculated for each 2x2 sub-matrix, and the results were stored in the new matrix.\n\nTo summarize the process:\n\n1. We started with a 4x4 matrix.\n2. We used a 2x2 sliding window to calculate the average of each sub-matrix.\n3. The resulting averages were stored in a 3x3 matrix.\n\nThe final 3x3 matrix after performing average pooling is:\n\n```\n[[7.25, 0.25, 2.75],\n [2.00, 2.00, 1.25],\n [7.00, 8.25, 1.25]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 sub-matrix from the original matrix.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
