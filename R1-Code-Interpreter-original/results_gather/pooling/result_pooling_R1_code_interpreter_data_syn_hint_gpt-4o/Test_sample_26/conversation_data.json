    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the 2x2 window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D array format:\n   ```\n   [\n     [7, 9, 2, -8],\n     [-1, 1, 7, 20],\n     [8, -8, 16, -1],\n     [-4, 6, -10, -10]\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 sliding window to iterate over the matrix. The window will slide from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the sliding window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n\n4. **Resulting Matrix**: The resulting matrix will be of size (N-n+1)x(N-n+1), where N is the size of the original matrix and n is the size of the sliding window. In this case, the resulting matrix will be 3x3.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 9, 2, -8],\n    [-1, 1, 7, 20],\n    [8, -8, 16, -1],\n    [-4, 6, -10, -10]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the resulting matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it has successfully performed the max pooling operation on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n```\n[\n  [9, 9, 20],\n  [8, 16, 20],\n  [8, 16, 16]\n]\n```\n\nThis matrix is obtained by sliding the 2x2 window across the original matrix and taking the maximum value from each window. The process was implemented correctly, and the output matches the expected result.\n\nSince the task has been completed successfully, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
