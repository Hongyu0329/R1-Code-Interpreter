    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the 2x2 window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting maximum values will form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Slide a 2x2 window across the matrix. The window will start at the top-left corner and move right and down.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **Result Matrix**: Store these maximum values in a new matrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n```\n19, 11, -6, -6\n11, 2, 8, 2\n6, 20, 12, 10\n-10, -8, 13, 14\n```\n\nThe 2x2 sliding window will move as follows:\n- Top-left corner (0,0) to (1,1)\n- Top-right corner (0,1) to (1,2)\n- Bottom-left corner (1,0) to (2,1)\n- Bottom-right corner (1,1) to (2,2)\n- And so on...\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [19, 11, -6, -6],\n    [11, 2, 8, 2],\n    [6, 20, 12, 10],\n    [-10, -8, 13, 14]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the output matrix\noutput_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult = [[0] * output_size for _ in range(output_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        result[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the max pooling operation was performed correctly, and the output matrix is as expected. The 2x2 sliding window was applied to the 4x4 matrix, and the maximum values from each window were collected to form the new matrix.\n\nLet's verify the result step-by-step:\n\n1. **First Window (Top-left corner)**:\n   - Elements: [19, 11, 11, 2]\n   - Maximum: 19\n\n2. **Second Window (Top-middle)**:\n   - Elements: [11, -6, 2, 8]\n   - Maximum: 11\n\n3. **Third Window (Top-right corner)**:\n   - Elements: [-6, -6, 8, 2]\n   - Maximum: 8\n\n4. **Fourth Window (Middle-left)**:\n   - Elements: [11, 2, 6, 20]\n   - Maximum: 20\n\n5. **Fifth Window (Center)**:\n   - Elements: [2, 8, 20, 12]\n   - Maximum: 20\n\n6. **Sixth Window (Middle-right)**:\n   - Elements: [8, 2, 12, 10]\n   - Maximum: 12\n\n7. **Seventh Window (Bottom-left)**:\n   - Elements: [6, 20, -10, -8]\n   - Maximum: 20\n\n8. **Eighth Window (Bottom-middle)**:\n   - Elements: [20, 12, -8, 13]\n   - Maximum: 20\n\n9. **Ninth Window (Bottom-right corner)**:\n   - Elements: [12, 10, 13, 14]\n   - Maximum: 14\n\nThe resulting matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n```\n[[19, 11, 8],\n [20, 20, 12],\n [20, 20, 14]]\n```\n\nThis confirms that the max pooling operation was performed correctly. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'[[19, 11, 8], [20, 20, 12], [20, 20, 14]]'>>>"
