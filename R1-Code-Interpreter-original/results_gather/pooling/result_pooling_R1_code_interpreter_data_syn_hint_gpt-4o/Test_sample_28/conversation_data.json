  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window.

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 window to slide across the matrix. The window will start at the top-left corner and move right and down.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **Result Matrix**: Store the maximum values in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix.\n\nThe original matrix is:\n```\n9, -9, 4, -3\n-1, -8, 15, 7\n11, 13, -9, 17\n20, 15, 20, -7\n```\n\nThe resulting matrix after max pooling with a 2x2 window will be a 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, -9, 4, -3],\n    [-1, -8, 15, 7],\n    [11, 13, -9, 17],\n    [20, 15, 20, -7]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nN = len(matrix)\n\n# Resultant matrix dimensions\nresult_size = N - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the window\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the max pooled matrix. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the max pooling operation was performed correctly, and the output matrix is as expected. The 2x2 sliding window was applied to the original 4x4 matrix, and the maximum values from each window were used to form the new 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's verify the result step-by-step:\n\n1. **First Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window at (0,0): `[[9, -9], [-1, -8]]` → Max: 9\n   - Window at (0,1): `[[-9, 4], [-8, 15]]` → Max: 15\n   - Window at (0,2): `[[4, -3], [15, 7]]` → Max: 15\n\n2. **Second Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window at (1,0): `[[-1, -8], [11, 13]]` → Max: 13\n   - Window at (1,1): `[[-8, 15], [13, -9]]` → Max: 15\n   - Window at (1,2): `[[15, 7], [-9, 17]]` → Max: 17\n\n3. **Third Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window at (2,0): `[[11, 13], [20, 15]]` → Max: 20\n   - Window at (2,1): `[[13, -9], [15, 20]]` → Max: 20\n   - Window at (2,2): `[[-9, 17], [20, -7]]` → Max: 20\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n```\n[[9, 15, 15],\n [13, 15, 17],\n [20, 20, 20]]\n```\n\nThis confirms that the max pooling operation was performed correctly. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
