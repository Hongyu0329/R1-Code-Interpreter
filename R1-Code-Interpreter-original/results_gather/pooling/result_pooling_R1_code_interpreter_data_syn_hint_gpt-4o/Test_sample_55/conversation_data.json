    "To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to calculate the average of each 2x2 sub-matrix as the window slides across the original matrix. The resulting matrix will be a 3x3 matrix because the window can slide across three positions horizontally and three positions vertically.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the 2x2 sub-matrices**: \n   - The top-left corner of each sub-matrix will be the starting point for calculating the average.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix, the top-left corners of the 2x2 sub-matrices will be at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\n2. **Calculate the average for each sub-matrix**:\n   - For each 2x2 sub-matrix, sum the four elements and divide by 4 to get the average.\n\n3. **Store the averages in a new matrix**:\n   - The new matrix will be a 3x3 matrix where each element is the average of a corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix from the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the averages and form the new matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original 4x4 matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [14, 10, 8, -3],\n    [-4, 13, 8, 11],\n    [-8, -4, -9, 1],\n    [-9, 15, 8, 7]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the new matrix\nnew_matrix_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix\nnew_matrix = np.zeros((new_matrix_size, new_matrix_size))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(new_matrix_size):\n    for j in range(new_matrix_size):\n        # Extract the 2x2 sub-matrix\n        sub_matrix = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Calculate the average\n        average = np.mean(sub_matrix)\n        # Store the average in the new matrix\n        new_matrix[i, j] = average\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average of each 2x2 sub-matrix and store the results in a new 3x3 matrix. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average pooling operation was performed correctly, and the resulting 3x3 matrix was computed without any errors. The averages were calculated for each 2x2 sub-matrix, and the results were stored in the new matrix.\n\nThe resulting matrix from the average pooling operation is:\n```\n[[ 8.25  9.75  6.  ]\n [-0.75  2.    2.75]\n [-1.5   2.5   1.75]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 sliding window from the original 4x4 matrix.\n\nSince the task has been completed successfully, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
