    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible 2x2 window in the matrix, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. **Resultant Matrix Construction**: Construct a new matrix from these averages, which will be of size (N-n+1) x (N-n+1), where N is the size of the original matrix and n is the size of the sliding window.\n\nLet's break down the steps with the given matrix:\n\nOriginal Matrix:\n```\n-1, 11, -10, 8\n8, 13, -9, 13\n-8, 12, 5, 0\n-6, -6, 20, -9\n```\n\nThe sliding window size is 2x2, so the resultant matrix will be 3x3.\n\nNow, let's write the code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-1, 11, -10, 8],\n    [8, 13, -9, 13],\n    [-8, 12, 5, 0],\n    [-6, -6, 20, -9]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resultant matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the resultant matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the resultant matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the resultant matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 2x2 window and store the results in a new matrix. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average pooling operation was performed correctly, and the resultant matrix was calculated as expected. The process involved iterating over each possible 2x2 window in the original matrix, calculating the average of the elements within each window, and storing these averages in a new matrix.\n\nThe resultant matrix is:\n```\n[[7.75, 1.25, 0.5],\n [6.25, 5.25, 2.25],\n [-2.0, 7.75, 4.0]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 window in the original 4x4 matrix. The code efficiently computes these averages by iterating over the possible starting positions of the 2x2 windows and calculating the sum and average for each window.\n\nSince the code execution was successful and the output is correct, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
