    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within each 2x2 section. The resulting averages will form a new matrix.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: Represent the given matrix in a 2D array format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. **Result Matrix Construction**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1) x (N-n+1), where N is the size of the original matrix and n is the size of the sliding window.\n\n### Matrix and Sliding Window Details:\n\n- Original Matrix (4x4):\n  ```\n  3, 13, 4, 14\n  17, -9, -5, 10\n  8, 0, 7, 13\n  13, -6, 1, 8\n  ```\n\n- Sliding Window Size: 2x2\n\n- Resulting Matrix Size: (4-2+1) x (4-2+1) = 3x3\n\n### Calculation:\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations and output the resulting matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [3, 13, 4, 14],\n    [17, -9, -5, 10],\n    [8, 0, 7, 13],\n    [13, -6, 1, 8]\n])\n\n# Size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the resulting matrix\nresult_matrix = np.zeros((result_size, result_size))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the window\n        window_average = np.mean(window)\n        # Store the average in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i, j] = window_average\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the average for each 2x2 window and store it in the resulting 3x3 matrix. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result provides the correct output for the average pooling operation using a 2x2 sliding window on the given 4x4 matrix. The resulting 3x3 matrix contains the average values of each 2x2 window as expected.\n\nTo ensure clarity and correctness, let's break down the results:\n\n1. **First Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window 1 (Top-left): \\((3 + 13 + 17 - 9) / 4 = 6\\)\n   - Window 2 (Top-middle): \\((13 + 4 - 9 - 5) / 4 = 0.75\\)\n   - Window 3 (Top-right): \\((4 + 14 - 5 + 10) / 4 = 5.75\\)\n\n2. **Second Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window 4 (Middle-left): \\((17 - 9 + 8 + 0) / 4 = 4\\)\n   - Window 5 (Middle-middle): \\((-9 - 5 + 0 + 7) / 4 = -1.75\\)\n   - Window 6 (Middle-right): \\((-5 + 10 + 7 + 13) / 4 = 6.25\\)\n\n3. **Third Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window 7 (Bottom-left): \\((8 + 0 + 13 - 6) / 4 = 3.75\\)\n   - Window 8 (Bottom-middle): \\((0 + 7 - 6 + 1) / 4 = 0.5\\)\n   - Window 9 (Bottom-right): \\((7 + 13 + 1 + 8) / 4 = 7.25\\)\n\nThe code correctly computes these averages and outputs the resulting matrix. Since the task is straightforward and the code is efficient for this problem size, no further optimization or symbolic computing is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
