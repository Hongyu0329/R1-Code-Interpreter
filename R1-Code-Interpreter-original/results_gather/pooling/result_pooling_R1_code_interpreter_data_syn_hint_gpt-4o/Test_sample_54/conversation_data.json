    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D array format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the numbers within the window.\n3. **Result Matrix Construction**: Construct a new matrix with the calculated averages, maintaining the relative positions of the windows.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- The given matrix is:\n  ```\n  -5, 5, -5, 12\n  20, -4, 17, -7\n  -1, 7, -7, 19\n  -6, 5, 15, -1\n  ```\n\n- The 2x2 sliding window will move across the matrix, and for each position, we calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n- The possible top-left positions for the 2x2 window in a 4x4 matrix are:\n  - (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n  - (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n  - (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n- For each position, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window and store it in the corresponding position in the result matrix.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to compute the result matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-5, 5, -5, 12],\n    [20, -4, 17, -7],\n    [-1, 7, -7, 19],\n    [-6, 5, 15, -1]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average values for each 2x2 window and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average pooling operation was performed correctly, and the resulting matrix was computed as expected. The result matrix is:\n\n```\n[[4.0, 3.25, 4.25],\n [5.5, 3.25, 5.5],\n [1.25, 5.0, 6.5]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 sliding window in the original 4x4 matrix. Each value in the result matrix corresponds to the average of the numbers in a 2x2 window from the original matrix.\n\nSince the code execution was successful and the result is correct, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
