    "To solve this problem, we need to perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window at each position. The result will be a new matrix of averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 3x3 window within the 6x6 matrix, calculate the average of the numbers in the window.\n3. **Resultant Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (6-3+1)x(6-3+1) = 4x4.\n4. **Output the Result**: Format the output as a 2D array.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [17, -6, 2, 10, 6, 1],\n    [5, -8, -4, 12, 7, -2],\n    [10, 6, -2, -3, 4, 2],\n    [6, 5, 13, -2, 18, 15],\n    [10, -8, 6, 5, -9, -8],\n    [17, -7, 16, 7, -4, 7]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the output matrix\noutput_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = [[0] * output_size for _ in range(output_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 3x3 window\n        window_sum = 0\n        for wi in range(window_size):\n            for wj in range(window_size):\n                window_sum += matrix[i + wi][j + wj]\n        \n        # Calculate the average and store it in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 3x3 window and store the results in a new 4x4 matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result seems correct, as it provides the average values for each 3x3 sliding window in the original 6x6 matrix. The output is a 4x4 matrix, which is expected given the dimensions of the sliding window and the original matrix.\n\nTo ensure clarity and correctness, let's break down the process and verify the calculations:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The original matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3. This means the sliding window can move across the matrix in such a way that it covers all possible 3x3 submatrices.\n\n2. **Output Matrix Dimensions**: The output matrix will be (6-3+1)x(6-3+1) = 4x4, as the sliding window can move 4 steps horizontally and 4 steps vertically.\n\n3. **Average Calculation**: For each position of the sliding window, the code calculates the sum of the elements within the window and then divides by 9 (since the window is 3x3) to get the average.\n\n4. **Output**: The output matrix contains the averages of each 3x3 window, arranged in the order corresponding to their positions in the original matrix.\n\nGiven the code execution result, the calculations appear to be correct. The output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[2.22, 0.78, 3.56, 4.11],\n [3.44, 1.89, 4.78, 5.67],\n [5.11, 2.22, 3.33, 2.44],\n [6.44, 3.89, 5.56, 3.22]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 3x3 window in the original matrix.\n\nIf there are no further issues or specific requirements for symbolic computing or optimization, the current solution is appropriate for the task. \n\nIf you have any specific requirements or need further optimization, please let me know. Otherwise, here is the final answer:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
