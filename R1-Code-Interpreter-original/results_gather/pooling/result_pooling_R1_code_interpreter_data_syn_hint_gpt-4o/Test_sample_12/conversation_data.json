    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Definition**: We have a 3x3 matrix:\n   ```\n   1, 3, 8\n   13, -7, 4\n   -1, -9, -4\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a 2x2 sliding window. This means we will slide the window across the matrix, starting from the top-left corner, and move it to the right and then down.\n\n3. **Max Pooling Operation**:\n   - Start at the top-left corner (0,0) of the matrix and consider the 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     1, 3\n     13, -7\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this window is 13.\n   \n   - Move the window one step to the right:\n     ```\n     3, 8\n     -7, 4\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this window is 8.\n\n   - Move the window down to the next row (0,1):\n     ```\n     13, -7\n     -1, -9\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this window is 13.\n\n   - Move the window one step to the right:\n     ```\n     -7, 4\n     -9, -4\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this window is 4.\n\n4. **Resulting Matrix**: The resulting matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n   ```\n   13, 8\n   13, 4\n   ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 3, 8],\n    [13, -7, 4],\n    [-1, -9, -4]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Initialize the resulting matrix\nresult = []\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(len(matrix) - window_size + 1):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(len(matrix[0]) - window_size + 1):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        max_value = max(window)\n        row.append(max_value)\n    result.append(row)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the output matches the expected result of the max pooling operation on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n```\n13, 8\n13, 4\n```\n\nThis confirms that the max pooling operation was performed correctly. The code efficiently slides the window across the matrix, extracts the values within each window, and computes the maximum value for each window position.\n\nSince the task is complete and the output is as expected, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
