We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n12, 2, 13, 1\n20, 9, -4, -9\n9, 1, 5, 1\n11, 17, -3, 15\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding a smaller window over the matrix and taking the maximum value from each window position to form a new matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D array format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 window to slide over the matrix. The window will start from the top-left corner and move right and then down.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **New Matrix Formation**: Collect these maximum values to form a new matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [12, 2, 13, 1],\n    [20, 9, -4, -9],\n    [9, 1, 5, 1],\n    [11, 17, -3, 15]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        new_matrix[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the output matrix is the result of performing max pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The process involves taking the maximum value from each 2x2 window as it slides across the matrix.\n\nLet's verify the result step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Matrix**:\n   ```\n   12, 2, 13, 1\n   20, 9, -4, -9\n   9, 1, 5, 1\n   11, 17, -3, 15\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window and Max Pooling**:\n   - For the top-left 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     12, 2\n     20, 9\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 20.\n\n   - For the top-middle 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     2, 13\n     9, -4\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 13.\n\n   - For the top-right 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     13, 1\n     -4, -9\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 13.\n\n   - For the middle-left 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     20, 9\n     9, 1\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 20.\n\n   - For the middle 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     9, -4\n     1, 5\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 9.\n\n   - For the middle-right 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     -4, -9\n     5, 1\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 5.\n\n   - For the bottom-left 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     9, 1\n     11, 17\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 17.\n\n   - For the bottom-middle 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     1, 5\n     17, -3\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 17.\n\n   - For the bottom-right 2x2 window:\n     ```\n     5, 1\n     -3, 15\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 15.\n\n3. **Resulting Matrix**:\n   ```\n   20, 13, 13\n   20, 9, 5\n   17, 17, 15\n   ```\n\nThe code correctly implements the max pooling operation, and the output matches the expected result.
