    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 window to slide across the matrix. The window will start at the top-left corner and move right and down.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **Result Matrix**: Store the maximum values in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1)x(N-n+1), where N is the size of the original matrix and n is the size of the sliding window.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 3, 20, 3],\n    [6, 17, 12, -7],\n    [17, 20, 17, -2],\n    [16, -9, 0, -7]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        max_value = max(window)\n        # Store the maximum value in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max_value\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window on the given 4x4 matrix. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it has successfully performed the max pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The resulting matrix is:\n\n```\n[[17, 20, 20],\n [20, 20, 17],\n [20, 20, 17]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is obtained by sliding the 2x2 window across the original matrix and taking the maximum value from each window. The process is as follows:\n\n1. **First Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window at (0,0): max(4, 3, 6, 17) = 17\n   - Window at (0,1): max(3, 20, 17, 12) = 20\n   - Window at (0,2): max(20, 3, 12, -7) = 20\n\n2. **Second Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window at (1,0): max(6, 17, 17, 20) = 20\n   - Window at (1,1): max(17, 12, 20, 17) = 20\n   - Window at (1,2): max(12, -7, 17, -2) = 17\n\n3. **Third Row of Result Matrix**:\n   - Window at (2,0): max(17, 20, 16, -9) = 20\n   - Window at (2,1): max(20, 17, -9, 0) = 20\n   - Window at (2,2): max(17, -2, 0, -7) = 17\n\nThe code correctly implements the max pooling operation, and the result is as expected. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[17, 20, 20], [20, 20, 17], [20, 20, 17]]>>>"
