    "To solve this problem, we need to perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The sliding window will move across the matrix, calculating the average of the numbers within the window at each position. The result will be a new matrix of averages.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 3x3 window within the 6x6 matrix, calculate the average of the numbers in the window.\n3. **Resultant Matrix**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (6-3+1)x(6-3+1) = 4x4.\n4. **Output the Result**: Format the output as a 2D array.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original 6x6 matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 4, 11, -2, -10, 8],\n    [0, 5, 3, 15, -7, 10],\n    [20, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6],\n    [14, 9, -5, 10, 6, 17],\n    [-7, 17, 4, -3, 20, 0],\n    [8, 9, 13, -10, -2, 11]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the output matrix\noutput_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = [[0] * output_size for _ in range(output_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 3x3 window\n        window_sum = 0\n        for wi in range(window_size):\n            for wj in range(window_size):\n                window_sum += matrix[i + wi][j + wj]\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window and output the resulting 4x4 matrix.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average pooling operation was performed correctly, and the output is a 4x4 matrix with the calculated averages. The task was to perform average pooling on a 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, and the code has successfully achieved this.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[5.222222222222222, 4.666666666666667, 1.5555555555555556, 2.6666666666666665],\n [5.333333333333333, 4.777777777777778, 2.888888888888889, 6.777777777777778],\n [6.0, 4.222222222222222, 4.0, 6.666666666666667],\n [6.888888888888889, 4.888888888888889, 3.6666666666666665, 5.444444444444445]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 3x3 window as it slides across the original matrix. Each element in the output matrix corresponds to the average of a 3x3 section of the input matrix.\n\nSince the task has been completed successfully, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
