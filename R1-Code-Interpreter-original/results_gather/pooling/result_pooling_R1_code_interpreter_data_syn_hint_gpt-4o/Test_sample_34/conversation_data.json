    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on a given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   -5, 2, -9, -7\n   -8, -8, 9, -2\n   13, 0, -5, -8\n   19, 13, 4, 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a 2x2 window to slide over the matrix. The window will slide from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n3. **Max Pooling Operation**:\n   - For each position of the 2x2 window, find the maximum value.\n   - The window will slide over the matrix, and for each position, we will calculate the maximum value.\n\n4. **Resulting Matrix**: The resulting matrix will be smaller than the original matrix. Since we are using a 2x2 window on a 4x4 matrix, the resulting matrix will be 3x3.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the resulting matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-5, 2, -9, -7],\n    [-8, -8, 9, -2],\n    [13, 0, -5, -8],\n    [19, 13, 4, 5]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the resulting matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        result_matrix[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window on the given 4x4 matrix. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result provided the max pooled matrix correctly. The process involved iterating over the original matrix with a 2x2 sliding window and finding the maximum value in each window. The resulting matrix is a 3x3 matrix, which is expected when using a 2x2 window on a 4x4 matrix.\n\nThe resulting matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n```\n[[2, 9, 9],\n [13, 9, 9],\n [19, 13, 5]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the maximum values found in each 2x2 window as the window slides across the original matrix.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
