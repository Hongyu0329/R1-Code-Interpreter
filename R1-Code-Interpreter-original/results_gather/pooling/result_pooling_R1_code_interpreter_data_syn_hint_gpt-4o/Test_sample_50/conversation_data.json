    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The average pooling operation involves calculating the average of the numbers within each 2x2 window as it slides across the matrix. The resulting averages will form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. **Result Matrix Construction**: Store these averages in a new matrix, which will be of size (N-n+1) x (N-n+1), where N is the size of the original matrix and n is the size of the sliding window.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n2, -7, -10, 1\n14, 5, 18, -5\n7, 7, 18, -9\n9, 9, 10, -5\n```\n\nWe will perform the average pooling with a 2x2 window. The resulting matrix will be 3x3 because the window can slide 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, -7, -10, 1],\n    [14, 5, 18, -5],\n    [7, 7, 18, -9],\n    [9, 9, 10, -5]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (\n            matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n            matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        )\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = window_sum / (window_size * window_size)\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 2x2 window and store the results in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the final result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average pooling operation was performed correctly, and the resulting matrix is as expected. The code calculates the average of each 2x2 window and stores these averages in a new matrix.\n\nLet's verify the calculations for each 2x2 window to ensure the results are correct:\n\n1. **Top-left 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: 2, -7, 14, 5\n   - Average: (2 + (-7) + 14 + 5) / 4 = 3.5\n\n2. **Top-middle 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: -7, -10, 5, 18\n   - Average: ((-7) + (-10) + 5 + 18) / 4 = 1.5\n\n3. **Top-right 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: -10, 1, 18, -5\n   - Average: ((-10) + 1 + 18 + (-5)) / 4 = 1.0\n\n4. **Middle-left 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: 14, 5, 7, 7\n   - Average: (14 + 5 + 7 + 7) / 4 = 8.25\n\n5. **Middle 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: 5, 18, 7, 18\n   - Average: (5 + 18 + 7 + 18) / 4 = 12.0\n\n6. **Middle-right 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: 18, -5, 18, -9\n   - Average: (18 + (-5) + 18 + (-9)) / 4 = 5.5\n\n7. **Bottom-left 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: 7, 7, 9, 9\n   - Average: (7 + 7 + 9 + 9) / 4 = 8.0\n\n8. **Bottom-middle 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: 7, 18, 9, 10\n   - Average: (7 + 18 + 9 + 10) / 4 = 11.0\n\n9. **Bottom-right 2x2 window**:\n   - Elements: 18, -9, 10, -5\n   - Average: (18 + (-9) + 10 + (-5)) / 4 = 3.5\n\nThe calculations match the output from the code execution. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> [[3.5, 1.5, 1.0], [8.25, 12.0, 5.5], [8.0, 11.0, 3.5]]"
