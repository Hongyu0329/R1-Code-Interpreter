    "To solve this problem, we need to perform an average pooling operation on a 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. The average pooling operation involves calculating the average of the numbers within each 3x3 window as it slides across the matrix. The resulting averages will form a new matrix.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 3x3 window to slide over the matrix. The window will start from the top-left corner and move right until it reaches the end of the row, then move down one row and repeat.\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n4. **Store Results**: Store these averages in a new matrix that represents the result of the average pooling operation.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 12, 3, 2, -9],\n    [-1, -1, -7, 10, 1],\n    [20, -8, -3, -10, -6],\n    [12, -4, 5, 3, 13],\n    [12, 12, 15, 3, 0]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix after pooling\nresult_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = [[0] * result_size for _ in range(result_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(result_size):\n    for j in range(result_size):\n        # Extract the 3x3 window\n        window = [matrix[x][j:j+window_size] for x in range(i, i+window_size)]\n        # Flatten the window and calculate the average\n        window_values = [num for row in window for num in row]\n        average = sum(window_values) / len(window_values)\n        # Store the average in the result matrix\n        result_matrix[i][j] = average\n\n# Print the result matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 3x3 window and store the results in a new matrix. Let's execute this code to get the final result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average pooling operation was performed correctly, and the output matrix was generated without any errors. The result matrix contains the average values of each 3x3 sliding window from the original 5x5 matrix.\n\nLet's summarize the final result:\n\nThe average pooling operation on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window results in the following 3x3 matrix:\n\n```\n[[1.67, -0.22, -2.11],\n [1.44, -1.67, 0.67],\n [6.78, 1.44, 2.22]]\n```\n\nThese values are rounded to two decimal places for clarity.\n\nThe process involved:\n- Sliding a 3x3 window over the original matrix.\n- Calculating the average of the numbers within each window.\n- Storing these averages in a new matrix.\n\nThis operation effectively reduces the size of the matrix while capturing the local average features of the original matrix.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
