We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n6, 9, -7, 10\n-8, 10, 16, -1\n7, 0, 1, 0\n16, -1, 17, 6\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a max pooling operation on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. The max pooling operation involves sliding the window across the matrix and finding the maximum value within each window. The resulting values form a new matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D list format.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 2x2 window to slide across the matrix. The window will start at the top-left corner and move right and then down.\n3. **Max Pooling**: For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n4. **New Matrix Formation**: Store these maximum values in a new matrix, which will be smaller than the original matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 9, -7, 10],\n    [-8, 10, 16, -1],\n    [7, 0, 1, 0],\n    [16, -1, 17, 6]\n]\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the size of the new matrix\nnew_size = len(matrix) - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix\nnew_matrix = [[0] * new_size for _ in range(new_size)]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(new_size):\n    for j in range(new_size):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = [\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[i][j+1],\n            matrix[i+1][j], matrix[i+1][j+1]\n        ]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        new_matrix[i][j] = max(window)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooled matrix using a 2x2 sliding window. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the max pooling operation was performed correctly, and the output matrix is as expected. The 2x2 sliding window was applied to the 4x4 matrix, and the maximum values from each window were used to form the new 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's verify the result step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Matrix**:\n   ```\n   6, 9, -7, 10\n   -8, 10, 16, -1\n   7, 0, 1, 0\n   16, -1, 17, 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Sliding Window and Max Values**:\n   - Window starting at (0,0): [6, 9, -8, 10] → Max: 10\n   - Window starting at (0,1): [9, -7, 10, 16] → Max: 16\n   - Window starting at (0,2): [-7, 10, 16, -1] → Max: 16\n   - Window starting at (1,0): [-8, 10, 7, 0] → Max: 10\n   - Window starting at (1,1): [10, 16, 0, 1] → Max: 16\n   - Window starting at (1,2): [16, -1, 1, 0] → Max: 16\n   - Window starting at (2,0): [7, 0, 16, -1] → Max: 16\n   - Window starting at (2,1): [0, 1, -1, 17] → Max: 17\n   - Window starting at (2,2): [1, 0, 17, 6] → Max: 17\n\n3. **Resulting Matrix**:\n   ```\n   10, 16, 16\n   10, 16, 16\n   16, 17, 17\n   ```\n\nThe code correctly implements the max pooling operation, and the resulting matrix matches the expected output. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
