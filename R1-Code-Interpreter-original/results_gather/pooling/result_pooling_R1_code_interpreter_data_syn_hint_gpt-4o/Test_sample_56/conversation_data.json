    "To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to slide the window across the matrix, calculate the average of the numbers within each window, and then arrange these averages into a new matrix.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Matrix Representation**: First, represent the given matrix in a 2D array format.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each possible position of the 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. **New Matrix Construction**: Construct a new matrix with the calculated averages, which will be a 3x3 matrix since the original matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2.\n\n### Calculation:\n- The original matrix is:\n  ```\n  -8, -6, 2, 18\n  3, 13, 20, 9\n  -8, -6, 0, -4\n  -10, -4, 10, 10\n  ```\n- The sliding window will move across the matrix, and for each position, we calculate the average of the 2x2 block.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the averages and form the new matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [-8, -6, 2, 18],\n    [3, 13, 20, 9],\n    [-8, -6, 0, -4],\n    [-10, -4, 10, 10]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the original matrix\nN = 4\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nn = 2\n\n# Resultant matrix after average pooling\nresult = []\n\n# Iterate over the matrix with the sliding window\nfor i in range(N - n + 1):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(N - n + 1):\n        # Calculate the average of the current 2x2 window\n        window_sum = (matrix[i][j] + matrix[i][j+1] +\n                      matrix[i+1][j] + matrix[i+1][j+1])\n        window_avg = window_sum / (n * n)\n        row.append(window_avg)\n    result.append(row)\n\n# Print the resultant matrix\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average for each 2x2 window and store the results in a new 3x3 matrix. Let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the average pooling operation was performed correctly, and the output matrix is as expected. The 2x2 sliding window was applied to the 4x4 matrix, and the averages were calculated for each window position, resulting in a 3x3 matrix.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[0.5, 7.25, 12.25],\n [0.5, 6.75, 6.25],\n [-7.0, 0.0, 4.0]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix.\n\nSince the task has been completed successfully, I will now provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
