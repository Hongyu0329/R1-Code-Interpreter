    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom. For each position of the window, we will calculate the average of the numbers within the window. The resulting averages will form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Define the original 5x5 matrix.\n2. Define the size of the sliding window (3x3).\n3. Slide the window across the matrix, calculating the average for each position.\n4.
