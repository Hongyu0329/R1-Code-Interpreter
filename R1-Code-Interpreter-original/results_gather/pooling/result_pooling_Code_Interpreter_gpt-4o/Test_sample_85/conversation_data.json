    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom. For each position of the window, we will calculate the average of the numbers within the window. The resulting averages will form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Definition**: Define the original 5x5 matrix.\n2. **Sliding Window**: Use a 3x3 window to slide across the matrix.\n3. **Calculate Averages**: For each position of the window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n4. **Form New Matrix**: Arrange these averages in a new matrix.\n\nLet's perform these steps.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the original 5x5 matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [-9, 20, -4, 6, -9],\n    [-2, 10, 14, 19, 0],\n    [-3, 12, 15, 7, -10],\n    [6, -9, 17, 7, 11],\n    [8, 2, 6, -9, -5]\n])\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the new matrix after pooling\nnew_matrix_size = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the new matrix to store the averages\npooled_matrix = np.zeros((new_matrix_size, new_matrix_size))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(new_matrix_size):\n    for j in range(new_matrix_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the current window\n        pooled_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(window)\n\npooled_matrix\nassistant > The result of performing average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window is a new 3x3 matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5.89 & 11.00 & 4.22 \\\\\n6.67 & 10.22 & 8.89 \\\\\n6.00 & 5.33 & 4.33 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nEach value in this matrix represents the average of the numbers within a 3x3 window from the original matrix."
