    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, calculate the average of the numbers within each window, and then arrange these averages into a new matrix.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n11,  4, -7, -9\n 3, -10,  2,  9\n-7,  5, -8, 13\n17,  1,  5, -9\n```\n\nThe sliding window will move across the matrix, and for each position, we will calculate the average of the numbers within the 2x2 window. The resulting matrix will have dimensions of (N-1)x(N-1) since the window is 2x2.\n\nLet's perform the average pooling operation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [11, 4, -7, -9],\n    [3, -10, 2, 9],\n    [-7, 5, -8, 13],\n    [17, 1, 5, -9]\n])\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_dim = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_dim, output_dim))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_dim):\n    for j in range(output_dim):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the window\n        window_average = np.mean(window)\n        # Store the average in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = window_average\n\noutput_matrix\nassistant > The resulting matrix after performing average pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n\n```\n[[ 2.00, -2.75, -1.25],\n [-2.25, -2.75,  4.00],\n [ 4.00,  0.75,  0.25]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix."
