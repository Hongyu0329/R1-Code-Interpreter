We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n1, -3, -9, 4\n-3, 15, -5, 2\n-5, 5, 2, 10\n-4, 6, 12, 13\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom, and for each position of the window, we will find the maximum value within that window. The resulting values will form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the 2x2 window across the matrix.\n2. For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the window.\n3.
