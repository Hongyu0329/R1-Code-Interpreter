    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom. For each position of the window, we will find the maximum value within that 3x3 sub-matrix. The resulting values will form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the top-left corner of the matrix and extract the 3x3 sub-matrix.\n2. Find the maximum value in this sub-matrix.\n3. Slide the window one position to the right and repeat the process until the window reaches the end of the row.\n4. Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the window reaches the bottom of the matrix.\n5. Collect all the maximum values to form the new matrix.\n\nLet's perform these steps on the given matrix:\n\n```\n17, -2, 14, -1, 19\n11, 11, -1, 5, -2\n15, 19, 17, 3, -5\n-8, 9, 19, -6, 10\n12, 14, 11, 18, -10\n```\n\nWe'll calculate the max-pooled matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the original 5x5 matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [17, -2, 14, -1, 19],\n    [11, 11, -1, 5, -2],\n    [15, 19, 17, 3, -5],\n    [-8, 9, 19, -6, 10],\n    [12, 14, 11, 18, -10]\n])\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the size of the resulting matrix after max pooling\noutput_size = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\nmax_pooled_matrix = np.zeros((output_size, output_size))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the current 3x3 window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        max_pooled_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\nmax_pooled_matrix\nassistant > The max-pooled matrix obtained by using a 3x3 sliding window on the given 5x5 matrix is:\n\n```\n19, 19, 19\n19, 19, 19\n19, 19, 19\n```\n\nEach element in this 3x3 matrix represents the maximum value found in the corresponding 3x3 window of the original matrix."
