    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom, and find the maximum value in each 2x2 window. The resulting maximum values will form a new matrix.\n\nLet's break down the given matrix and perform the max pooling operation:\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n6, 9, -7, 10\n-8, 10, 16, -1\n7, 0, 1, 0\n16, -1, 17, 6\n```\n\nWe will slide a 2x2 window over this matrix and find the maximum value in each window. The windows will be:\n\n1. Top-left corner: \n   ```\n   6, 9\n   -8, 10\n   ```\n   Max value: 10\n\n2. Top-middle:\n   ```\n   9, -7\n   10, 16\n   ```\n   Max value: 16\n\n3. Top-right:\n   ```\n   -7, 10\n   16, -1\n   ```\n   Max value: 16\n\n4. Middle-left:\n   ```\n   -8, 10\n   7, 0\n   ```\n   Max value: 10\n\n5. Center:\n   ```\n   10, 16\n   0, 1\n   ```\n   Max value: 16\n\n6. Middle-right:\n   ```\n   16, -1\n   1, 0\n   ```\n   Max value: 16\n\n7. Bottom-left:\n   ```\n   7, 0\n   16, -1\n   ```\n   Max value: 16\n\n8. Bottom-middle:\n   ```\n   0, 1\n   -1, 17\n   ```\n   Max value: 17\n\n9. Bottom-right:\n   ```\n   1, 0\n   17, 6\n   ```\n   Max value: 17\n\nNow, let's arrange these maximum values into a new matrix. The resulting matrix will be a 3x3 matrix because the original 4x4 matrix is reduced by the size of the sliding window (2x2).\n\nLet's compute this using Python.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [6, 9, -7, 10],\n    [-8, 10, 16, -1],\n    [7, 0, 1, 0],\n    [16, -1, 17, 6]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_size = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_size, output_size), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\noutput_matrix\nassistant > The resulting matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window on the given matrix is:\n\n```\n10, 16, 16\n10, 16, 16\n16, 17, 17\n```\n\nThis 3x3 matrix represents the maximum values from each 2x2 window in the original 4x4 matrix."
