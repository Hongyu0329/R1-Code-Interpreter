    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, calculate the average of the numbers within each window, and then arrange these averages into a new matrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-8 & -6 & 2 & 18 \\\\\n3 & 13 & 20 & 9 \\\\\n-8 & -6 & 0 & -4 \\\\\n-10 & -4 & 10 & 10 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe 2x2 sliding window will move across the matrix, and the average of each window will be calculated as follows:\n\n1.
