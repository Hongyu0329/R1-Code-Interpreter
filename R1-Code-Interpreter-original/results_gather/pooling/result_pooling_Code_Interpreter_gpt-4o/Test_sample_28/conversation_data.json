    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each 2x2 sub-matrix. The resulting matrix will be smaller, with dimensions reduced by one in both rows and columns compared to the original matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the 2x2 window across the matrix.\n2. For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 sub-matrix.\n3.
