    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, calculate the average of the numbers within each window, and then arrange these averages in a new matrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\n```\n20, -6,  8,  6, -5\n 0,  4, 19,  2, 18\n 4,  1, 19, 15, -3\n14,  5, 16, 19, -6\n 3,  3, -1, -7, 20\n```\n\nThe sliding window is 3x3, so the resulting matrix will be smaller than the original.
