    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, find the maximum value in each window, and then arrange these maximum values to form a new matrix.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n12,  2, 13,  1\n20,  9, -4, -9\n 9,  1,  5,  1\n11, 17, -3, 15\n```\n\nThe 2x2 sliding window will move across the matrix as follows:\n\n1. Top-left corner (0,0) to (1,1)\n2. Top-right corner (0,1) to (1,2)\n3. Bottom-left corner (1,0) to (2,1)\n4. Bottom-right corner (1,1) to (2,2)\n5. Continue this pattern until the entire matrix is covered.\n\nLet's perform the max pooling operation and construct the new matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [12, 2, 13, 1],\n    [20, 9, -4, -9],\n    [9, 1, 5, 1],\n    [11, 17, -3, 15]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        max_value = np.max(window)\n        # Assign the maximum value to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = max_value\n\noutput_matrix\nassistant > The result of performing max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window is:\n\n```\n20, 13, 13\n20,  9,  5\n17, 17, 15\n```\n\nThis new matrix is formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix."
