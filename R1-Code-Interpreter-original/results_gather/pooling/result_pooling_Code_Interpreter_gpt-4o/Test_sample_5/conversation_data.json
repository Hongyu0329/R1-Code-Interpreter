    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each 2x2 sub-matrix. The resulting matrix will be a 2x2 matrix, as the sliding window reduces the dimensions by 1 in each direction.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n17, -10, 13\n7, -5, 9\n-9, 11, 17\n```\n\nLet's perform the max pooling operation:\n\n1. **First 2x2 window (top-left corner):**\n   ```\n   17, -10\n   7,  -5\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 17\n\n2. **Second 2x2 window (top-right corner):**\n   ```\n   -10, 13\n   -5,  9\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 13\n\n3. **Third 2x2 window (bottom-left corner):**\n   ```\n   7,  -5\n   -9, 11\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 11\n\n4. **Fourth 2x2 window (bottom-right corner):**\n   ```\n   -5, 9\n   11, 17\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 17\n\nThe resulting matrix after max pooling is:\n```\n17, 13\n11, 17\n```\n\nLet's implement this in code to verify the result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [17, -10, 13],\n    [7, -5, 9],\n    [-9, 11, 17]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_size = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_size, output_size), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\noutput_matrix\nassistant > The resulting matrix after performing max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window is:\n\n```\n17, 13\n11, 17\n```\n\nThis confirms the manual calculation."
