    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, calculate the average of the numbers within each window, and then arrange these averages into a new matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the 2x2 window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom.\n2. For each position of the window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n3. Store the average in the corresponding position of the new matrix.\n4.
