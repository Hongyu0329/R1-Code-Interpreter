    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, calculate the average of the numbers within each window, and then arrange these averages in a new matrix.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n20, 8, 7, -1\n12, 3, -2, -3\n5, 4, 18, -10\n2, 10, -7, 6\n```\n\nThe 2x2 sliding window will move across the matrix, and the average of each window will be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Start at the top-left corner and calculate the average of the first 2x2 window.\n2. Slide the window to the right and calculate the average of the next 2x2 window.\n3. Continue sliding the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n4. Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the entire matrix is covered.\n\nLet's perform the average pooling operation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [20, 8, 7, -1],\n    [12, 3, -2, -3],\n    [5, 4, 18, -10],\n    [2, 10, -7, 6]\n])\n\n# Define the size of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the current window\n        window_average = np.mean(window)\n        # Store the average in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = window_average\n\noutput_matrix\nassistant > The result of performing average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window is:\n\n```\n10.75, 4.00, 0.25\n6.00, 5.75, 0.75\n5.25, 6.25, 1.75\n```\n\nThis new matrix represents the average values calculated from each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix."
