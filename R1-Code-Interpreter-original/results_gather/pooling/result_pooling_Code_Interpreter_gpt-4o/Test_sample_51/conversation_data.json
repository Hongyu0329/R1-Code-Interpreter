    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, calculate the average of the numbers within each window, and then arrange these averages in a new matrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\n```\n10, 11, -2,  1\n 5, 18, 18, 18\n-9, -1,  7, 11\n12, -1, -4, 14\n```\n\nThe sliding window will move across the matrix, and for each position, we will calculate the average of the 2x2 sub-matrix.
