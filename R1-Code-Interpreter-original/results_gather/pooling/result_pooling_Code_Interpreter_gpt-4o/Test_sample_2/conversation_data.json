    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to slide the window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each 2x2 sub-matrix. The resulting matrix will have dimensions reduced by one in both rows and columns compared to the original matrix.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n-2, 12, -3\n11, 20, -3\n-9, -4, 10\n```\n\nLet's perform the max pooling operation step by step:\n\n1. **First 2x2 window (top-left corner):**\n   ```\n   -2, 12\n   11, 20\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 20\n\n2. **Second 2x2 window (top-right corner):**\n   ```\n   12, -3\n   20, -3\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 20\n\n3. **Third 2x2 window (bottom-left corner):**\n   ```\n   11, 20\n   -9, -4\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 20\n\n4. **Fourth 2x2 window (bottom-right corner):**\n   ```\n   20, -3\n   -4, 10\n   ```\n   Maximum value: 20\n\nThe resulting matrix after max pooling is:\n```\n20, 20\n20, 20\n```\n\nLet's compute this using Python to verify the result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [-2, 12, -3],\n    [11, 20, -3],\n    [-9, -4, 10]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the resulting matrix\nresult_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\nresult_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the result matrix\nresult_matrix = np.zeros((result_rows, result_cols), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_rows):\n    for j in range(result_cols):\n        # Extract the current window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        result_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\nresult_matrix\nassistant > The resulting matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window on the given matrix is:\n\n```\n20, 20\n20, 20\n```\n\nThis confirms our manual calculation."
