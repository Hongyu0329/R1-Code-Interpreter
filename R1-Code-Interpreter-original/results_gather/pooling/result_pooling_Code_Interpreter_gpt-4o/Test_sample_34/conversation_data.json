    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, find the maximum value in each window, and then arrange these maximum values to form a new matrix.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n-5,  2, -9, -7\n-8, -8,  9, -2\n13,  0, -5, -8\n19, 13,  4,  5\n```\n\nThe sliding window will move across the matrix as follows:\n\n1. Top-left corner of the window at (0,0):\n   ```\n   -5,  2\n   -8, -8\n   ```\n   Max value: 2\n\n2. Top-left corner of the window at (0,1):\n   ```\n    2, -9\n   -8,  9\n   ```\n   Max value: 9\n\n3. Top-left corner of the window at (0,2):\n   ```\n   -9, -7\n    9, -2\n   ```\n   Max value: 9\n\n4. Top-left corner of the window at (1,0):\n   ```\n   -8, -8\n   13,  0\n   ```\n   Max value: 13\n\n5. Top-left corner of the window at (1,1):\n   ```\n   -8,  9\n    0, -5\n   ```\n   Max value: 9\n\n6. Top-left corner of the window at (1,2):\n   ```\n    9, -2\n   -5, -8\n   ```\n   Max value: 9\n\n7. Top-left corner of the window at (2,0):\n   ```\n   13,  0\n   19, 13\n   ```\n   Max value: 19\n\n8. Top-left corner of the window at (2,1):\n   ```\n    0, -5\n   13,  4\n   ```\n   Max value: 13\n\n9. Top-left corner of the window at (2,2):\n   ```\n   -5, -8\n    4,  5\n   ```\n   Max value: 5\n\nNow, let's arrange these maximum values into a new matrix. The resulting matrix will be of size (N-n+1) x (N-n+1), which is 3x3 in this case. Let's compute this using Python.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [-5,  2, -9, -7],\n    [-8, -8,  9, -2],\n    [13,  0, -5, -8],\n    [19, 13,  4,  5]\n])\n\n# Dimensions\nN = matrix.shape[0]\nn = 2\n\n# Resulting matrix dimensions\nresult_dim = N - n + 1\nresult_matrix = np.zeros((result_dim, result_dim))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(result_dim):\n    for j in range(result_dim):\n        window = matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n]\n        result_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\nresult_matrix\nassistant > The resulting matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n\n```\n[[ 2,  9,  9],\n [13,  9,  9],\n [19, 13,  5]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the maximum values found in each 2x2 window as it slides across the original matrix."
