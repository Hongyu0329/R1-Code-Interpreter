We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n16, 2, -9, 17\n5, -3, -5, 2\n3, 7, 19, -9\n8, 5, -8, 12\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix, calculate the average of the numbers within each window, and then arrange these averages in a new matrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n16 & 2 & -9 & 17 \\\\\n5 & -3 & -5 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 7 & 19 & -9 \\\\\n8 & 5 & -8 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe 2x2 sliding window will move across the matrix, and we will calculate the average for each position of the window.
