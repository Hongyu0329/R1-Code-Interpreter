    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom, finding the maximum value in each 2x2 sub-matrix. The resulting matrix will be smaller than the original matrix, with dimensions reduced by one in both rows and columns.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the top-left 2x2 sub-matrix and find the maximum value.\n2. Slide the window one column to the right and find the maximum value in the new 2x2 sub-matrix.\n3. Continue sliding the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n4. Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the entire matrix is covered.\n\nLet's perform the max pooling operation on the given matrix:\n\n```\nOriginal Matrix:\n16, 4, 15, 5\n16, 15, 4, 6\n18, 1, -5, -2\n8, 20, -10, 14\n```\n\nWe'll calculate the max-pooled matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [16, 4, 15, 5],\n    [16, 15, 4, 6],\n    [18, 1, -5, -2],\n    [8, 20, -10, 14]\n])\n\n# Dimensions of the sliding window\nwindow_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] - window_size + 1\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] - window_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\nmax_pooled_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 window\n        window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the current window\n        max_pooled_matrix[i, j] = np.max(window)\n\nmax_pooled_matrix\nassistant > The result of the max pooling operation on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window is:\n\n```\n16, 15, 15\n18, 15,  6\n20, 20, 14\n```\n\nThis is the new matrix formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 sub-matrix as the window slides across the original matrix."
