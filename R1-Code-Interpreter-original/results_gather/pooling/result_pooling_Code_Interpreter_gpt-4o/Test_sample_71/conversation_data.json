We define the \"average pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, calculating the average value in each sliding window. Then, the average values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform average pooling on the following matrix by using a 3*3 sliding window:\n0, 12, 3, 2, -9\n-1, -1, -7, 10, 1\n20, -8, -3, -10, -6\n12, -4, 5, 3, 13\n12, 12, 15, 3, 0\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we will slide the window across the matrix from left to right and top to bottom.
