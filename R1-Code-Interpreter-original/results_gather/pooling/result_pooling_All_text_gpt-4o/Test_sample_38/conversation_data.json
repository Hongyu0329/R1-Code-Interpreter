  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 3*3 sliding window:\n0, 9, -1, -10, 20\n4, 2, -7, -3, 6\n-5, -10, 5, 14, 3\n7, -4, 7, -1, 6\n7, 5, 2, -9, 17\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - Horizontally, the window can start at columns 0, 1, and 2 (3 positions).\n   - Vertically, the window can start at rows 0, 1, and 2 (3 positions).\n   - This results in a total of 3x3 = 9 sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, find the maximum value within the 3x3 window.\n   - Record the maximum value in a new matrix that corresponds to the top-left position of the sliding window.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Window**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):** \n     - Sub-matrix: \n       ```\n       0, 9, -1\n       4, 2, -7\n       -5, -10, 5\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 9\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     - Sub-matrix:\n       ```\n       9, -1, -10\n       2, -7, -3\n       -10, 5, 14\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 14\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     - Sub-matrix:\n       ```\n       -1, -10, 20\n       -7, -3, 6\n       5, 14, 3\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 20\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     - Sub-matrix:\n       ```\n       4, 2, -7\n       -5, -10, 5\n       7, -4, 7\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 7\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     - Sub-matrix:\n       ```\n       2, -7, -3\n       -10, 5, 14\n       -4, 7, -1\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 14\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     - Sub-matrix:\n       ```\n       -7, -3, 6\n       5, 14, 3\n       7, -1, 6\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 14\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     - Sub-matrix:\n       ```\n       -5, -10, 5\n       7, -4, 7\n       7, 5, 2\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 7\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     - Sub-matrix:\n       ```\n       -10, 5, 14\n       -4, 7, -1\n       5, 2, -9\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 14\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     - Sub-matrix:\n       ```\n       5, 14, 3\n       7, -1, 6\n       2, -9, 17\n       ```\n     - Maximum value: 17\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     9, 14, 20\n     7, 14, 14\n     7, 14, 17\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling with a 3x3 sliding window, is:\n```\n9, 14, 20\n7, 14, 14\n7, 14, 17\n```"
