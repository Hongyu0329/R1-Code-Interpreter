    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     19, 14, 3, 6\n     5, 12, 7, -2\n     -8, 13, -2, 20\n     11, 10, -4, -10\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of windows vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and slide the window across the matrix, calculating the average for each position.\n\n5. **List the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a new 3x3 matrix, maintaining the order of the windows.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  ```\n  19, 14\n  5, 12\n  ```\n  Average = (19 + 14 + 5 + 12) / 4 = 50 / 4 = 12.5\n\n- **Window 2 (Top row, middle)**:\n  ```\n  14, 3\n  12, 7\n  ```\n  Average = (14 + 3 + 12 + 7) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9.0\n\n- **Window 3 (Top row, right)**:\n  ```\n  3, 6\n  7, -2\n  ```\n  Average = (3 + 6 + 7 - 2) / 4 = 14 / 4 = 3.5\n\n- **Window 4 (Middle row, left)**:\n  ```\n  5, 12\n  -8, 13\n  ```\n  Average = (5 + 12 - 8 + 13) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5\n\n- **Window 5 (Middle row, middle)**:\n  ```\n  12, 7\n  13, -2\n  ```\n  Average = (12 + 7 + 13 - 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5\n\n- **Window 6 (Middle row, right)**:\n  ```\n  7, -2\n  -2, 20\n  ```\n  Average = (7 - 2 - 2 + 20) / 4 = 23 / 4 = 5.75\n\n- **Window 7 (Bottom row, left)**:\n  ```\n  -8, 13\n  11, 10\n  ```\n  Average = (-8 + 13 + 11 + 10) / 4 = 26 / 4 = 6.5\n\n- **Window 8 (Bottom row, middle)**:\n  ```\n  13, -2\n  10, -4\n  ```\n  Average = (13 - 2 + 10 - 4) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25\n\n- **Window 9 (Bottom row, right)**:\n  ```\n  -2, 20\n  -4, -10\n  ```\n  Average = (-2 + 20 - 4 - 10) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1.0\n\n6. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     12.5, 9.0, 3.5\n     5.5, 7.5, 5.75\n     6.5, 4.25, 1.0\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n```\n12.5, 9.0, 3.5\n5.5, 7.5, 5.75\n6.5, 4.25, 1.0\n```"
