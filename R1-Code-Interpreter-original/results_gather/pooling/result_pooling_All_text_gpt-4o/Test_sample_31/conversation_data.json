We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n5, 3, 2, 7\n-9, 13, 10, -3\n12, 3, -2, 16\n14, 4, 9, 18\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5, 3, 2, 7\n     -9, 13, 10, -3\n     12, 3, -2, 16\n     14, 4, 9, 18\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means it will cover 2 rows and 2 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the original matrix is 4x4 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of positions the sliding window can take horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the sliding window can take vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Apply the Sliding Window and Find Maximums:**\n   - For each position of the sliding window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n\n   - **Position (0,0):**\n     ```\n     5, 3\n     -9, 13\n     ```\n     Maximum = 13\n\n   - **Position (0,1):**\n     ```\n     3, 2\n     13, 10\n     ```\n     Maximum = 13\n\n   - **Position (0,2):**\n     ```\n     2, 7\n     10, -3\n     ```\n     Maximum = 10\n\n   - **Position (1,0):**\n     ```\n     -9, 13\n     12, 3\n     ```\n     Maximum = 13\n\n   - **Position (1,1):**\n     ```\n     13, 10\n     3, -2\n     ```\n     Maximum = 13\n\n   - **Position (1,2):**\n     ```\n     10, -3\n     -2, 16\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Position (2,0):**\n     ```\n     12, 3\n     14, 4\n     ```\n     Maximum = 14\n\n   - **Position (2,1):**\n     ```\n     3, -2\n     4, 9\n     ```\n     Maximum = 9\n\n   - **Position (2,2):**\n     ```\n     -2, 16\n     9, 18\n     ```\n     Maximum = 18\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values found in each sliding window according to their original positions to form a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     13, 13, 10\n     13, 13, 16\n     14, 9, 18\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after max pooling, is:\n```\n13, 13, 10\n13, 13, 16\n14, 9, 18\n```"
