    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically, and similarly for other rows.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, as the window can move 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated by summing all the numbers in the window and dividing by 9.\n\n4. **Arrange the Averages into a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages from each window will form a new 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window starting at (0,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 8 & -7 \\\\\n  -8 & -5 & 14 \\\\\n  14 & -5 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (10 + 8 - 7 - 8 - 5 + 14 + 14 - 5 + 9) / 9 = 3.78\n\n- **Window starting at (0,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & -7 & -3 \\\\\n  -5 & 14 & 11 \\\\\n  -5 & 9 & 8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (8 - 7 - 3 - 5 + 14 + 11 - 5 + 9 + 8) / 9 = 3.33\n\n- **Window starting at (0,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -7 & -3 & 19 \\\\\n  14 & 11 & -2 \\\\\n  9 & 8 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-7 - 3 + 19 + 14 + 11 - 2 + 9 + 8 - 9) / 9 = 4.44\n\n- **Window starting at (1,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & -5 & 14 \\\\\n  14 & -5 & 9 \\\\\n  2 & 10 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-8 - 5 + 14 + 14 - 5 + 9 + 2 + 10 - 5) / 9 = 2.89\n\n- **Window starting at (1,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & 14 & 11 \\\\\n  -5 & 9 & 8 \\\\\n  10 & -5 & 7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-5 + 14 + 11 - 5 + 9 + 8 + 10 - 5 + 7) / 9 = 5.78\n\n- **Window starting at (1,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & 11 & -2 \\\\\n  9 & 8 & -9 \\\\\n  -5 & 7 & 12 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (14 + 11 - 2 + 9 + 8 - 9 - 5 + 7 + 12) / 9 = 5.00\n\n- **Window starting at (2,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & -5 & 9 \\\\\n  2 & 10 & -5 \\\\\n  18 & 0 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (14 - 5 + 9 + 2 + 10 - 5 + 18 + 0 - 9) / 9 = 3.78\n\n- **Window starting at (2,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & 9 & 8 \\\\\n  10 & -5 & 7 \\\\\n  0 & -9 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-5 + 9 + 8 + 10 - 5 + 7 + 0 - 9 - 10) / 9 = 0.56\n\n- **Window starting at (2,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & 8 & -9 \\\\\n  -5 & 7 & 12 \\\\\n  -9 & -10 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (9 + 8 - 9 - 5 + 7 + 12 - 9 - 10 + 1) / 9 = 0.44\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix formed by the averages is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   3.78 & 3.33 & 4.44 \\\\\n   2.89 & 5.78 & 5.00 \\\\\n   3.78 & 0.56 & 0.44 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3.78 & 3.33 & 4.44 \\\\\n2.89 & 5.78 & 5.00 \\\\\n3.78 & 0.56 & 0.44 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
