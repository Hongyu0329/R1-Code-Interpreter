    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages from each window form a new 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner starting at (0,0))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -9 & 20 & -4 \\\\\n  -2 & 10 & 14 \\\\\n  -3 & 12 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-9 + 20 - 4 - 2 + 10 + 14 - 3 + 12 + 15) / 9 = 53 / 9 \\approx 5.89\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Starting at (0,1))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & -4 & 6 \\\\\n  10 & 14 & 19 \\\\\n  12 & 15 & 7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((20 - 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 19 + 12 + 15 + 7) / 9 = 99 / 9 = 11\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Starting at (0,2))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -4 & 6 & -9 \\\\\n  14 & 19 & 0 \\\\\n  15 & 7 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-4 + 6 - 9 + 14 + 19 + 0 + 15 + 7 - 10) / 9 = 38 / 9 \\approx 4.22\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Starting at (1,0))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 10 & 14 \\\\\n  -3 & 12 & 15 \\\\\n  6 & -9 & 17 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-2 + 10 + 14 - 3 + 12 + 15 + 6 - 9 + 17) / 9 = 60 / 9 \\approx 6.67\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Starting at (1,1))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 14 & 19 \\\\\n  12 & 15 & 7 \\\\\n  -9 & 17 & 7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((10 + 14 + 19 + 12 + 15 + 7 - 9 + 17 + 7) / 9 = 92 / 9 \\approx 10.22\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Starting at (1,2))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & 19 & 0 \\\\\n  15 & 7 & -10 \\\\\n  17 & 7 & 11 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((14 + 19 + 0 + 15 + 7 - 10 + 17 + 7 + 11) / 9 = 80 / 9 \\approx 8.89\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Starting at (2,0))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -3 & 12 & 15 \\\\\n  6 & -9 & 17 \\\\\n  8 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-3 + 12 + 15 + 6 - 9 + 17 + 8 + 2 + 6) / 9 = 54 / 9 = 6\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Starting at (2,1))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & 15 & 7 \\\\\n  -9 & 17 & 7 \\\\\n  2 & 6 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((12 + 15 + 7 - 9 + 17 + 7 + 2 + 6 - 9) / 9 = 48 / 9 \\approx 5.33\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Starting at (2,2))**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  15 & 7 & -10 \\\\\n  17 & 7 & 11 \\\\\n  6 & -9 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((15 + 7 - 10 + 17 + 7 + 11 + 6 - 9 - 5) / 9 = 39 / 9 \\approx 4.33\\)\n\n6. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix formed by the averages is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   5.89 & 11 & 4.22 \\\\\n   6.67 & 10.22 & 8.89 \\\\\n   6 & 5.33 & 4.33 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5.89 & 11 & 4.22 \\\\\n6.67 & 10.22 & 8.89 \\\\\n6 & 5.33 & 4.33 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
