    "To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 4x4, and the sliding window is 2x2.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 2x2 sub-matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n\n4. **Arrange the Averages into a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages will form a new 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations for each window:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & -6 \\\\\n  3 & 13\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-8 + (-6) + 3 + 13}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Top-center)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -6 & 2 \\\\\n  13 & 20\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-6 + 2 + 13 + 20}{4} = \\frac{29}{4} = 7.25\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 18 \\\\\n  20 & 9\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{2 + 18 + 20 + 9}{4} = \\frac{49}{4} = 12.25\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 13 \\\\\n  -8 & -6\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{3 + 13 + (-8) + (-6)}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  13 & 20 \\\\\n  -6 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{13 + 20 + (-6) + 0}{4} = \\frac{27}{4} = 6.75\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & 9 \\\\\n  0 & -4\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{20 + 9 + 0 + (-4)}{4} = \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & -6 \\\\\n  -10 & -4\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-8 + (-6) + (-10) + (-4)}{4} = \\frac{-28}{4} = -7\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -6 & 0 \\\\\n  -4 & 10\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-6 + 0 + (-4) + 10}{4} = \\frac{0}{4} = 0\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & -4 \\\\\n  10 & 10\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{0 + (-4) + 10 + 10}{4} = \\frac{16}{4} = 4\\)\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages into a 3x3 matrix:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   0.5 & 7.25 & 12.25 \\\\\n   0.5 & 6.75 & 6.25 \\\\\n   -7 & 0 & 4\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.5 & 7.25 & 12.25 \\\\\n0.5 & 6.75 & 6.25 \\\\\n-7 & 0 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
