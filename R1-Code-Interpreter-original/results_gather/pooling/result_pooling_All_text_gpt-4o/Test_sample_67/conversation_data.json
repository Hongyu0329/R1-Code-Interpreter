    "To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     -8, 17, 7, 9\n     12, -10, 10, -3\n     12, 5, -6, 1\n     -6, -10, 3, 15\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means we will calculate the average of each 2x2 sub-matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is (4 - 2 + 1) = 3. So, there will be 3x3 = 9 windows in total.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and slide the window to the right and then down.\n\n5. **Compute the Averages**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n     ```\n     -8, 17\n     12, -10\n     ```\n     Average = (-8 + 17 + 12 - 10) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top row, middle):**\n     ```\n     17, 7\n     -10, 10\n     ```\n     Average = (17 + 7 - 10 + 10) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top row, right):**\n     ```\n     7, 9\n     10, -3\n     ```\n     Average = (7 + 9 + 10 - 3) / 4 = 23 / 4 = 5.75\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle row, left):**\n     ```\n     12, -10\n     12, 5\n     ```\n     Average = (12 - 10 + 12 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle row, middle):**\n     ```\n     -10, 10\n     5, -6\n     ```\n     Average = (-10 + 10 + 5 - 6) / 4 = -1 / 4 = -0.25\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle row, right):**\n     ```\n     10, -3\n     -6, 1\n     ```\n     Average = (10 - 3 - 6 + 1) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 0.5\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom row, left):**\n     ```\n     12, 5\n     -6, -10\n     ```\n     Average = (12 + 5 - 6 - 10) / 4 = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom row, middle):**\n     ```\n     5, -6\n     -10, 3\n     ```\n     Average = (5 - 6 - 10 + 3) / 4 = -8 / 4 = -2\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom row, right):**\n     ```\n     -6, 1\n     3, 15\n     ```\n     Average = (-6 + 1 + 3 + 15) / 4 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\n6. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     2.75, 6, 5.75\n     4.75, -0.25, 0.5\n     0.25, -2, 3.25\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n2.75, 6, 5.75\n4.75, -0.25, 0.5\n0.25, -2, 3.25\n```"
