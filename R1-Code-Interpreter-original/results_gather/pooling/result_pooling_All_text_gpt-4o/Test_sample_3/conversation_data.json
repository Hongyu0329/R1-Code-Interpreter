    "To perform max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     1, 5, 8\n     6, 15, -2\n     -3, -4, -3\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means it will cover 2 rows and 2 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is `3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is `3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of 2x2 = 4 sliding windows.\n\n3. **Apply the Sliding Window and Find Maximum Values:**\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n     - Covers elements: \n       ```\n       1, 5\n       6, 15\n       ```\n     - Maximum value is 15.\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-right corner):**\n     - Covers elements:\n       ```\n       5, 8\n       15, -2\n       ```\n     - Maximum value is 15.\n\n   - **Window 3 (Bottom-left corner):**\n     - Covers elements:\n       ```\n       6, 15\n       -3, -4\n       ```\n     - Maximum value is 15.\n\n   - **Window 4 (Bottom-right corner):**\n     - Covers elements:\n       ```\n       15, -2\n       -4, -3\n       ```\n     - Maximum value is 15.\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values from each sliding window according to their original positions:\n     ```\n     15, 15\n     15, 15\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Output:**\n   - The resulting matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n     ```\n     15, 15\n     15, 15\n     ```\n\nAnswer: \n15, 15\n15, 15"
