    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages from each window will form a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & -6 & -2 \\\\\n  -4 & 0 & -10 \\\\\n  20 & -4 & 3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((2 + (-6) + (-2) + (-4) + 0 + (-10) + 20 + (-4) + 3) / 9 = -0.111\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -6 & -2 & 17 \\\\\n  0 & -10 & 1 \\\\\n  -4 & 3 & 12 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-6) + (-2) + 17 + 0 + (-10) + 1 + (-4) + 3 + 12) / 9 = 1.222\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 17 & 3 \\\\\n  -10 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n  3 & 12 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-2) + 17 + 3 + (-10) + 1 + 3 + 3 + 12 + (-9)) / 9 = 2.111\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 3 & -4 \\\\\n  12 & -9 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(17 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + (-4) + 12 + (-9) + (-2)) / 9 = 2.444\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -4 & 0 & -10 \\\\\n  20 & -4 & 3 \\\\\n  -2 & -7 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-4) + 0 + (-10) + 20 + (-4) + 3 + (-2) + (-7) + (-2)) / 9 = -0.667\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & -10 & 1 \\\\\n  -4 & 3 & 12 \\\\\n  -7 & -2 & 19 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(0 + (-10) + 1 + (-4) + 3 + 12 + (-7) + (-2) + 19) / 9 = 1.333\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n  3 & 12 & -9 \\\\\n  -2 & 19 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-10) + 1 + 3 + 3 + 12 + (-9) + (-2) + 19 + (-1)) / 9 = 1.778\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 3 & -4 \\\\\n  12 & -9 & -2 \\\\\n  19 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(1 + 3 + (-4) + 12 + (-9) + (-2) + 19 + (-1) + 1) / 9 = 2.222\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & -4 & 3 \\\\\n  -2 & -7 & -2 \\\\\n  10 & 11 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(20 + (-4) + 3 + (-2) + (-7) + (-2) + 10 + 11 + 4) / 9 = 3.667\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -4 & 3 & 12 \\\\\n  -7 & -2 & 19 \\\\\n  11 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-4) + 3 + 12 + (-7) + (-2) + 19 + 11 + 4 + 0) / 9 = 4.000\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 12 & -9 \\\\\n  -2 & 19 & -1 \\\\\n  4 & 0 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(3 + 12 + (-9) + (-2) + 19 + (-1) + 4 + 0 + 5) / 9 = 3.444\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & -9 & -2 \\\\\n  19 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n  0 & 5 & 17 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(12 + (-9) + (-2) + 19 + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 5 + 17) / 9 = 4.667\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & -7 & -2 \\\\\n  10 & 11 & 4 \\\\\n  -4 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-2) + (-7) + (-2) + 10 + 11 + 4 + (-4) + 0 + (-7)) / 9 = 0.333\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -7 & -2 & 19 \\\\\n  11 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & -7 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-7) + (-2) + 19 + 11 + 4 + 0 + 0 + (-7) + 9) / 9 = 3.000\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 19 & -1 \\\\\n  4 & 0 & 5 \\\\\n  -7 & 9 & -8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-2) + 19 + (-1) + 4 + 0 + 5 + (-7) + 9 + (-8)) / 9 = 2.111\\)\n\n- **Window 16 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n  0 & 5 & 17 \\\\\n  9 & -8"
