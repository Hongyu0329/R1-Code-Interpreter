    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     -10, 9, -6, -2\n     -9, 9, 7, 15\n     12, -3, -10, 7\n     5, 3, 17, 9\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means it will cover 4 elements at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the sliding window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Sliding Window:**\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 4 numbers within the window.\n\n4. **Position the Averages in a New Matrix:**\n   - The resulting matrix will be 3x3, as there are 3 positions horizontally and 3 positions vertically.\n\nLet's calculate the averages for each sliding window:\n\n- **Top-left corner (0,0):**\n  - Elements: \\([-10, 9, -9, 9]\\)\n  - Average: \\((-10 + 9 - 9 + 9) / 4 = -1\\)\n\n- **Top-middle (0,1):**\n  - Elements: \\([9, -6, 9, 7]\\)\n  - Average: \\((9 - 6 + 9 + 7) / 4 = 4.75\\)\n\n- **Top-right corner (0,2):**\n  - Elements: \\([-6, -2, 7, 15]\\)\n  - Average: \\((-6 - 2 + 7 + 15) / 4 = 3.5\\)\n\n- **Middle-left (1,0):**\n  - Elements: \\([-9, 9, 12, -3]\\)\n  - Average: \\((-9 + 9 + 12 - 3) / 4 = 2.25\\)\n\n- **Center (1,1):**\n  - Elements: \\([9, 7, -3, -10]\\)\n  - Average: \\((9 + 7 - 3 - 10) / 4 = 0.75\\)\n\n- **Middle-right (1,2):**\n  - Elements: \\([7, 15, -10, 7]\\)\n  - Average: \\((7 + 15 - 10 + 7) / 4 = 4.75\\)\n\n- **Bottom-left corner (2,0):**\n  - Elements: \\([12, -3, 5, 3]\\)\n  - Average: \\((12 - 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 4.25\\)\n\n- **Bottom-middle (2,1):**\n  - Elements: \\([-3, -10, 3, 17]\\)\n  - Average: \\((-3 - 10 + 3 + 17) / 4 = 1.75\\)\n\n- **Bottom-right corner (2,2):**\n  - Elements: \\([-10, 7, 17, 9]\\)\n  - Average: \\((-10 + 7 + 17 + 9) / 4 = 5.75\\)\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     -1, 4.75, 3.5\n     2.25, 0.75, 4.75\n     4.25, 1.75, 5.75\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n```\n-1, 4.75, 3.5\n2.25, 0.75, 4.75\n4.25, 1.75, 5.75\n```"
