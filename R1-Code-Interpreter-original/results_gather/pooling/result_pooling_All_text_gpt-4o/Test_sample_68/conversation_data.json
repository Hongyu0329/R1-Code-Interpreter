    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, meaning there will be 9 windows in total.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window:**\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated by summing all the numbers in the window and dividing by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix:**\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until it reaches the end of the row.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the window has covered all possible positions.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix:**\n   - The resulting averages from each window will form a new 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n  - Elements: 0, 12, 3, 7, 10, -2, 15, 18, 5\n  - Average: (0 + 12 + 3 + 7 + 10 - 2 + 15 + 18 + 5) / 9 = 68 / 9 ≈ 7.56\n\n- **Window 2 (Top-middle):**\n  - Elements: 12, 3, 11, 10, -2, -7, 18, 5, 14\n  - Average: (12 + 3 + 11 + 10 - 2 - 7 + 18 + 5 + 14) / 9 = 64 / 9 ≈ 7.11\n\n- **Window 3 (Top-right):**\n  - Elements: 3, 11, -7, -2, -7, -3, 5, 14, 20\n  - Average: (3 + 11 - 7 - 2 - 7 - 3 + 5 + 14 + 20) / 9 = 34 / 9 ≈ 3.78\n\n- **Window 4 (Middle-left):**\n  - Elements: 7, 10, -2, 15, 18, 5, -1, 6, 4\n  - Average: (7 + 10 - 2 + 15 + 18 + 5 - 1 + 6 + 4) / 9 = 62 / 9 ≈ 6.89\n\n- **Window 5 (Middle):**\n  - Elements: 10, -2, -7, 18, 5, 14, 6, 4, 16\n  - Average: (10 - 2 - 7 + 18 + 5 + 14 + 6 + 4 + 16) / 9 = 64 / 9 ≈ 7.11\n\n- **Window 6 (Middle-right):**\n  - Elements: -2, -7, -3, 5, 14, 20, 4, 16, 8\n  - Average: (-2 - 7 - 3 + 5 + 14 + 20 + 4 + 16 + 8) / 9 = 55 / 9 ≈ 6.11\n\n- **Window 7 (Bottom-left):**\n  - Elements: 15, 18, 5, -1, 6, 4, -8, 14, -5\n  - Average: (15 + 18 + 5 - 1 + 6 + 4 - 8 + 14 - 5) / 9 = 48 / 9 ≈ 5.33\n\n- **Window 8 (Bottom-middle):**\n  - Elements: 18, 5, 14, 6, 4, 16, 14, -5, 10\n  - Average: (18 + 5 + 14 + 6 + 4 + 16 + 14 - 5 + 10) / 9 = 82 / 9 ≈ 9.11\n\n- **Window 9 (Bottom-right):**\n  - Elements: 5, 14, 20, 4, 16, 8, -5, 10, 3\n  - Average: (5 + 14 + 20 + 4 + 16 + 8 - 5 + 10 + 3) / 9 = 75 / 9 ≈ 8.33\n\n6. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - The new matrix formed by the averages is:\n     ```\n     7.56, 7.11, 3.78\n     6.89, 7.11, 6.11\n     5.33, 9.11, 8.33\n     ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n7.56, 7.11, 3.78\n6.89, 7.11, 6.11\n5.33, 9.11, 8.33\n```"
