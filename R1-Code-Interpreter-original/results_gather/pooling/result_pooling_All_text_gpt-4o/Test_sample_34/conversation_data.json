    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     -5,  2, -9, -7\n     -8, -8,  9, -2\n     13,  0, -5, -8\n     19, 13,  4,  5\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means it will cover 4 elements at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the sliding window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the new matrix.\n\n   - **First Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       -5,  2\n       -8, -8\n       ```\n       Max = 2\n\n     - Window 2 (shift right by 1 column):\n       ```\n        2, -9\n       -8,  9\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n     - Window 3 (shift right by 2 columns):\n       ```\n       -9, -7\n        9, -2\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 4 (shift down by 1 row):\n       ```\n       -8, -8\n       13,  0\n       ```\n       Max = 13\n\n     - Window 5 (shift right by 1 column):\n       ```\n       -8,  9\n        0, -5\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n     - Window 6 (shift right by 2 columns):\n       ```\n        9, -2\n       -5, -8\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 7 (shift down by 2 rows):\n       ```\n       13,  0\n       19, 13\n       ```\n       Max = 19\n\n     - Window 8 (shift right by 1 column):\n       ```\n        0, -5\n       13,  4\n       ```\n       Max = 13\n\n     - Window 9 (shift right by 2 columns):\n       ```\n       -5, -8\n        4,  5\n       ```\n       Max = 5\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values from each window into a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     2, 9, 9\n     13, 9, 9\n     19, 13, 5\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window, is:\n```\n2, 9, 9\n13, 9, 9\n19, 13, 5\n```"
