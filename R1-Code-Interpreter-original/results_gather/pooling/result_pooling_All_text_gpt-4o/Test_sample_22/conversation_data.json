We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n4, 3, 20, 3\n6, 17, 12, -7\n17, 20, 17, -2\n16, -9, 0, -7\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     4,  3, 20,  3\n     6, 17, 12, -7\n     17, 20, 17, -2\n     16, -9,  0, -7\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size. Here, it is (4 - 2 + 1) = 3.\n   - Therefore, there will be 3 windows horizontally and 3 windows vertically, resulting in a total of 3x3 = 9 windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the new matrix.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Window**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**: \n     ```\n     4, 3\n     6, 17\n     ```\n     Maximum = 17\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     ```\n     3, 20\n     17, 12\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     20, 3\n     12, -7\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     6, 17\n     17, 20\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 5 (Center)**:\n     ```\n     17, 12\n     20, 17\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     12, -7\n     17, -2\n     ```\n     Maximum = 17\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     17, 20\n     16, -9\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle)**:\n     ```\n     20, 17\n     -9, 0\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     17, -2\n     0, -7\n     ```\n     Maximum = 17\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix according to their original positions:\n     ```\n     17, 20, 20\n     20, 20, 17\n     20, 20, 17\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window, is:\n```\n17, 20, 20\n20, 20, 17\n20, 20, 17\n```"
