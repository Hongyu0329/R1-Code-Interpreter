We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n7, 9, 2, -8\n-1, 1, 7, 20\n8, -8, 16, -1\n-4, 6, -10, -10\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     7, 9, 2, -8\n     -1, 1, 7, 20\n     8, -8, 16, -1\n     -4, 6, -10, -10\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size. Here, N = 4 and n = 2, so we have (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 windows in each direction.\n\n3. **Slide the Window and Find Maximum Values**:\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each window.\n   - The windows and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **First Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       7, 9\n       -1, 1\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 9\n     - Window 2:\n       ```\n       9, 2\n       1, 7\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 9\n     - Window 3:\n       ```\n       2, -8\n       7, 20\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 4:\n       ```\n       -1, 1\n       8, -8\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 8\n     - Window 5:\n       ```\n       1, 7\n       -8, 16\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 16\n     - Window 6:\n       ```\n       7, 20\n       16, -1\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 7:\n       ```\n       8, -8\n       -4, 6\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 8\n     - Window 8:\n       ```\n       -8, 16\n       6, -10\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 16\n     - Window 9:\n       ```\n       16, -1\n       -10, -10\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 16\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in the order of their original window positions to form a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     9, 9, 20\n     8, 16, 20\n     8, 16, 16\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after max pooling, is:\n```\n9, 9, 20\n8, 16, 20\n8, 16, 16\n```"
