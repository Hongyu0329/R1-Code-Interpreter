    "To perform max pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to cover all possible 3x3 submatrices.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) windows.\n\n3. **Extract Each 3x3 Submatrix and Find the Maximum:**\n   - For each position of the sliding window, extract the 3x3 submatrix and find the maximum value within that submatrix.\n\n4. **Arrange the Maximum Values:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix according to the position of the sliding window.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 12 & 10 \\\\\n  19 & -5 & 17 \\\\\n  2 & 20 & 18 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n- **Window 2 (Top-center):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & 10 & 5 \\\\\n  -5 & 17 & 20 \\\\\n  20 & 18 & 20 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n- **Window 3 (Top-right corner):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 5 & 7 \\\\\n  17 & 20 & -1 \\\\\n  18 & 20 & 2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n- **Window 4 (Middle-left):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & -5 & 17 \\\\\n  2 & 20 & 18 \\\\\n  0 & -9 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n- **Window 5 (Middle-center):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & 17 & 20 \\\\\n  20 & 18 & 20 \\\\\n  -9 & -1 & -3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n- **Window 6 (Middle-right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & 20 & -1 \\\\\n  18 & 20 & 2 \\\\\n  -1 & -3 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n- **Window 7 (Bottom-left):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 20 & 18 \\\\\n  0 & -9 & -1 \\\\\n  10 & 5 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n- **Window 8 (Bottom-center):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & 18 & 20 \\\\\n  -9 & -1 & -3 \\\\\n  5 & -6 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n- **Window 9 (Bottom-right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  18 & 20 & 2 \\\\\n  -1 & -3 & -5 \\\\\n  -6 & -5 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 20\n\n5. **Form the Resulting Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   20 & 20 & 20 \\\\\n   20 & 20 & 20 \\\\\n   20 & 20 & 20 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n20 & 20 & 20 \\\\\n20 & 20 & 20 \\\\\n20 & 20 & 20 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
