    "To perform max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     -6, 12, -4\n     12, 19, 5\n     -5, 10, 17\n     ```\n   - We will use a 2x2 sliding window to find the maximum value in each window.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the original matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move in the following positions:\n     - Top-left corner (0,0)\n     - Top-middle (0,1)\n     - Middle-left (1,0)\n     - Middle (1,1)\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Sliding Window:**\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     -6, 12\n     12, 19\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 19.\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     12, -4\n     19, 5\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 19.\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     12, 19\n     -5, 10\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 19.\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     ```\n     19, 5\n     10, 17\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 19.\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - The new matrix formed by the maximum values from each sliding window is:\n     ```\n     19, 19\n     19, 19\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The result of the max pooling operation is a 2x2 matrix:\n     ```\n     19, 19\n     19, 19\n     ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n19, 19\n19, 19"
