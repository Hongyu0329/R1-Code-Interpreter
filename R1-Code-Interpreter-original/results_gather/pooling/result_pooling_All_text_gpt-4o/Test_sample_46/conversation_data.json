    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid:\n     ```\n     1, 4, 11, 3, 12\n     -9, 13, 11, 1, 9\n     16, 12, -9, 7, 4\n     8, 0, 14, -5, 6\n     -4, 0, -7, -1, 1\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically, and similarly for the next rows.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, as the window can slide 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the new matrix.\n   - Slide the window across the matrix and calculate the maximum for each position.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum Values for Each Window**:\n   - Window starting at (0,0):\n     ```\n     1, 4, 11\n     -9, 13, 11\n     16, 12, -9\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - Window starting at (0,1):\n     ```\n     4, 11, 3\n     13, 11, 1\n     12, -9, 7\n     ```\n     Maximum = 13\n\n   - Window starting at (0,2):\n     ```\n     11, 3, 12\n     11, 1, 9\n     -9, 7, 4\n     ```\n     Maximum = 12\n\n   - Window starting at (1,0):\n     ```\n     -9, 13, 11\n     16, 12, -9\n     8, 0, 14\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - Window starting at (1,1):\n     ```\n     13, 11, 1\n     12, -9, 7\n     0, 14, -5\n     ```\n     Maximum = 14\n\n   - Window starting at (1,2):\n     ```\n     11, 1, 9\n     -9, 7, 4\n     14, -5, 6\n     ```\n     Maximum = 14\n\n   - Window starting at (2,0):\n     ```\n     16, 12, -9\n     8, 0, 14\n     -4, 0, -7\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - Window starting at (2,1):\n     ```\n     12, -9, 7\n     0, 14, -5\n     0, -7, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 14\n\n   - Window starting at (2,2):\n     ```\n     -9, 7, 4\n     14, -5, 6\n     -7, -1, 1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 14\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     16, 13, 12\n     16, 14, 14\n     16, 14, 14\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling with a 3x3 sliding window, is:\n```\n16, 13, 12\n16, 14, 14\n16, 14, 14\n```"
