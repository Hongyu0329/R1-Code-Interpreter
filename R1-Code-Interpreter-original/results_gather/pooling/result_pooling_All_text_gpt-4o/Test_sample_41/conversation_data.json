    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid:\n     ```\n     6, 3, 8, 4, 20\n     -8, -8, 0, 19, -10\n     -7, 15, 2, -2, 10\n     9, -9, 10, 7, 13\n     -5, 11, -9, -1, 12\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 3x3.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 3x3 window position, find the maximum value within that window.\n   - Slide the window across the matrix and record the maximum values.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum Values for Each Window**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     6, 3, 8\n     -8, -8, 0\n     -7, 15, 2\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 15\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center)**:\n     ```\n     3, 8, 4\n     -8, 0, 19\n     15, 2, -2\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     8, 4, 20\n     0, 19, -10\n     2, -2, 10\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     -8, -8, 0\n     -7, 15, 2\n     9, -9, 10\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 15\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n     ```\n     -8, 0, 19\n     15, 2, -2\n     -9, 10, 7\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     0, 19, -10\n     2, -2, 10\n     10, 7, 13\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     ```\n     -7, 15, 2\n     9, -9, 10\n     -5, 11, -9\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 15\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n     ```\n     15, 2, -2\n     -9, 10, 7\n     11, -9, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 15\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right)**:\n     ```\n     2, -2, 10\n     10, 7, 13\n     -9, -1, 12\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 13\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix according to their original window positions:\n     ```\n     15, 19, 20\n     15, 19, 19\n     15, 15, 13\n     ```\n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling with a 3x3 sliding window is:\n```\n15, 19, 20\n15, 19, 19\n15, 15, 13\n```"
