  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n3, 2, 9\n-4, 1, 20\n18, 14, -5\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     3, 2, 9\n     -4, 1, 20\n     18, 14, -5\n     ```\n   - We will use a 2x2 sliding window to find the maximum value in each window.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the window can slide in the following positions:\n     - Top-left corner (0,0)\n     - Top-middle (0,1)\n     - Middle-left (1,0)\n     - Middle (1,1)\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Window:**\n   - **Window at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     3, 2\n     -4, 1\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 3.\n\n   - **Window at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     2, 9\n     1, 20\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 20.\n\n   - **Window at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     -4, 1\n     18, 14\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 18.\n\n   - **Window at (1,1):**\n     ```\n     1, 20\n     14, -5\n     ```\n     Maximum value is 20.\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values according to the positions of the sliding windows:\n     ```\n     3, 20\n     18, 20\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The resulting matrix after max pooling is:\n     ```\n     3, 20\n     18, 20\n     ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n3, 20\n18, 20\n```"
