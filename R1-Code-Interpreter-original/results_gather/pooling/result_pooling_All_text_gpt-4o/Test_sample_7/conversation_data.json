    "To perform max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5, 18, 17\n     16, 7, 5\n     -9, 4, 3\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means it will cover 2 rows and 2 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the window can slide in the following positions:\n     - Top-left corner (0,0)\n     - Top-middle (0,1)\n     - Middle-left (1,0)\n     - Middle-middle (1,1)\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Sliding Window:**\n   - **Window at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     5, 18\n     16, 7\n     ```\n     - Maximum value is 18.\n\n   - **Window at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     18, 17\n     7, 5\n     ```\n     - Maximum value is 18.\n\n   - **Window at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     16, 7\n     -9, 4\n     ```\n     - Maximum value is 16.\n\n   - **Window at (1,1):**\n     ```\n     7, 5\n     4, 3\n     ```\n     - Maximum value is 7.\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values according to the positions of the sliding windows:\n     ```\n     18, 18\n     16, 7\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The resulting matrix after max pooling is:\n     ```\n     18, 18\n     16, 7\n     ```\n\nAnswer: \n18, 18\n16, 7"
