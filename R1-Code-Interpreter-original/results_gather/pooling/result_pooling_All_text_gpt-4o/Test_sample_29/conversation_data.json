  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n20, 19, 12, 3\n-4, 6, 2, 11\n13, 19, 6, -9\n-1, 10, -9, -10\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     20, 19, 12, 3\n     -4, 6, 2, 11\n     13, 19, 6, -9\n     -1, 10, -9, -10\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the new matrix.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Window**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**: \n     ```\n     20, 19\n     -4, 6\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center)**:\n     ```\n     19, 12\n     6, 2\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     12, 3\n     2, 11\n     ```\n     Maximum = 12\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     -4, 6\n     13, 19\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n     ```\n     6, 2\n     19, 6\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     2, 11\n     6, -9\n     ```\n     Maximum = 11\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     13, 19\n     -1, 10\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n     ```\n     19, 6\n     10, -9\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     6, -9\n     -9, -10\n     ```\n     Maximum = 6\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in the order of their corresponding windows:\n     ```\n     20, 19, 12\n     19, 19, 11\n     19, 19, 6\n     ```\n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n```\n20, 19, 12\n19, 19, 11\n19, 19, 6\n```"
