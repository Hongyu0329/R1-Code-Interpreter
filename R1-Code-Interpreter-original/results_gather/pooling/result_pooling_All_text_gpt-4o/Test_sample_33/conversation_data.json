    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     17, 10, 6, 10\n     0, -5, 16, 16\n     0, 8, 0, 19\n     -2, 17, -8, 11\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix with a 2x2 window, the number of windows is (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 in both directions.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling:**\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each window.\n   - The windows and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **First Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       17, 10\n       0, -5\n       ```\n       Max value = 17\n\n     - Window 2:\n       ```\n       10, 6\n       -5, 16\n       ```\n       Max value = 16\n\n     - Window 3:\n       ```\n       6, 10\n       16, 16\n       ```\n       Max value = 16\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 4:\n       ```\n       0, -5\n       0, 8\n       ```\n       Max value = 8\n\n     - Window 5:\n       ```\n       -5, 16\n       8, 0\n       ```\n       Max value = 16\n\n     - Window 6:\n       ```\n       16, 16\n       0, 19\n       ```\n       Max value = 19\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 7:\n       ```\n       0, 8\n       -2, 17\n       ```\n       Max value = 17\n\n     - Window 8:\n       ```\n       8, 0\n       17, -8\n       ```\n       Max value = 17\n\n     - Window 9:\n       ```\n       0, 19\n       -8, 11\n       ```\n       Max value = 19\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values from each window into a new matrix, maintaining the order of the windows:\n     ```\n     17, 16, 16\n     8, 16, 19\n     17, 17, 19\n     ```\n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n```\n<<<17, 16, 16>, <8, 16, 19>, <17, 17, 19>>>\n```"
