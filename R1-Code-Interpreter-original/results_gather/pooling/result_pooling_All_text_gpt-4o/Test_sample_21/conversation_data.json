    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     10, 19, 3, 18\n     2, 20, 8, 8\n     1, 14, 12, -8\n     -6, 8, 11, -2\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the original matrix is 4x4 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the new matrix.\n\n   - **First Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       10, 19\n       2, 20\n       ```\n       Max value = 20\n     - Window 2:\n       ```\n       19, 3\n       20, 8\n       ```\n       Max value = 20\n     - Window 3:\n       ```\n       3, 18\n       8, 8\n       ```\n       Max value = 18\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 4:\n       ```\n       2, 20\n       1, 14\n       ```\n       Max value = 20\n     - Window 5:\n       ```\n       20, 8\n       14, 12\n       ```\n       Max value = 20\n     - Window 6:\n       ```\n       8, 8\n       12, -8\n       ```\n       Max value = 12\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 7:\n       ```\n       1, 14\n       -6, 8\n       ```\n       Max value = 14\n     - Window 8:\n       ```\n       14, 12\n       8, 11\n       ```\n       Max value = 14\n     - Window 9:\n       ```\n       12, -8\n       11, -2\n       ```\n       Max value = 12\n\n4. **Construct the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values from each window into a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     20, 20, 18\n     20, 20, 12\n     14, 14, 12\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of the max pooling operation, is:\n```\n20, 20, 18\n20, 20, 12\n14, 14, 12\n```"
