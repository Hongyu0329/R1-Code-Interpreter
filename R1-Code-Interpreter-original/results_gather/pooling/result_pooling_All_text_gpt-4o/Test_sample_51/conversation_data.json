    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     10, 11, -2, 1\n     5, 18, 18, 18\n     -9, -1, 7, 11\n     12, -1, -4, 14\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - The number of windows vertically = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of 3x3 = 9 windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n\n4. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     10, 11\n     5, 18\n     ```\n     Average = (10 + 11 + 5 + 18) / 4 = 44 / 4 = 11\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     ```\n     11, -2\n     18, 18\n     ```\n     Average = (11 - 2 + 18 + 18) / 4 = 45 / 4 = 11.25\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     -2, 1\n     18, 18\n     ```\n     Average = (-2 + 1 + 18 + 18) / 4 = 35 / 4 = 8.75\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     5, 18\n     -9, -1\n     ```\n     Average = (5 + 18 - 9 - 1) / 4 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n     ```\n     18, 18\n     -1, 7\n     ```\n     Average = (18 + 18 - 1 + 7) / 4 = 42 / 4 = 10.5\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     18, 18\n     7, 11\n     ```\n     Average = (18 + 18 + 7 + 11) / 4 = 54 / 4 = 13.5\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     ```\n     -9, -1\n     12, -1\n     ```\n     Average = (-9 - 1 + 12 - 1) / 4 = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n     ```\n     -1, 7\n     -1, -4\n     ```\n     Average = (-1 + 7 - 1 - 4) / 4 = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right)**:\n     ```\n     7, 11\n     -4, 14\n     ```\n     Average = (7 + 11 - 4 + 14) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix, corresponding to the positions of the windows:\n     ```\n     11, 11.25, 8.75\n     3.25, 10.5, 13.5\n     0.25, 0.25, 7\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n11, 11.25, 8.75\n3.25, 10.5, 13.5\n0.25, 0.25, 7\n```"
