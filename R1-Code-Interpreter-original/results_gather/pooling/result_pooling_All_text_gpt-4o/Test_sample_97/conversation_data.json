    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is a 6x6 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) possible windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting matrix will be a 4x4 matrix, as there are 16 windows in total.\n\nLet's perform the calculations for each window:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  4 & 10 & 19 \\\\\n  5 & 10 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -8 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 19 + 5 + 10 + 5 = 47\n  Average = 47 / 9 ≈ 5.22\n\n- **Window 2 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 1 & -8 \\\\\n  10 & 19 & 11 \\\\\n  10 & 5 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 1 + 1 - 8 + 10 + 19 + 11 + 10 + 5 - 10 = 39\n  Average = 39 / 9 ≈ 4.33\n\n- **Window 3 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & -8 & 5 \\\\\n  19 & 11 & 17 \\\\\n  5 & -10 & 13 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 1 - 8 + 5 + 19 + 11 + 17 + 5 - 10 + 13 = 53\n  Average = 53 / 9 ≈ 5.89\n\n- **Window 4 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & 5 & -7 \\\\\n  11 & 17 & 15 \\\\\n  -10 & 13 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -8 + 5 - 7 + 11 + 17 + 15 - 10 + 13 - 2 = 34\n  Average = 34 / 9 ≈ 3.78\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & 10 & 19 \\\\\n  5 & 10 & 5 \\\\\n  -4 & -10 & 2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 4 + 10 + 19 + 5 + 10 + 5 - 4 - 10 + 2 = 41\n  Average = 41 / 9 ≈ 4.56\n\n- **Window 6 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 19 & 11 \\\\\n  10 & 5 & -10 \\\\\n  -10 & 2 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 10 + 19 + 11 + 10 + 5 - 10 - 10 + 2 - 9 = 28\n  Average = 28 / 9 ≈ 3.11\n\n- **Window 7 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 11 & 17 \\\\\n  5 & -10 & 13 \\\\\n  2 & -9 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 19 + 11 + 17 + 5 - 10 + 13 + 2 - 9 + 15 = 63\n  Average = 63 / 9 ≈ 7.00\n\n- **Window 8 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 17 & 15 \\\\\n  -10 & 13 & -2 \\\\\n  -9 & 15 & -8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 11 + 17 + 15 - 10 + 13 - 2 - 9 + 15 - 8 = 42\n  Average = 42 / 9 ≈ 4.67\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 10 & 5 \\\\\n  -4 & -10 & 2 \\\\\n  12 & 11 & 11 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 5 + 10 + 5 - 4 - 10 + 2 + 12 + 11 + 11 = 42\n  Average = 42 / 9 ≈ 4.67\n\n- **Window 10 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 5 & -10 \\\\\n  -10 & 2 & -9 \\\\\n  11 & 11 & -7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 10 + 5 - 10 - 10 + 2 - 9 + 11 + 11 - 7 = 3\n  Average = 3 / 9 ≈ 0.33\n\n- **Window 11 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & -10 & 13 \\\\\n  2 & -9 & 15 \\\\\n  11 & -7 & 11 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 5 - 10 + 13 + 2 - 9 + 15 + 11 - 7 + 11 = 31\n  Average = 31 / 9 ≈ 3.44\n\n- **Window 12 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10 & 13 & -2 \\\\\n  -9 & 15 & -8 \\\\\n  -7 & 11 & 14 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -10 + 13 - 2 - 9 + 15 - 8 - 7 + 11 + 14 = 17\n  Average = 17 / 9 ≈ 1.89\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -4 & -10 & 2 \\\\\n  12 & 11 & 11 \\\\\n  13 & -9 & 10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -4 - 10 + 2 + 12 + 11 + 11 + 13 - 9 + 10 = 36\n  Average = 36 / 9 ≈ 4.00\n\n- **Window 14 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10 & 2 & -9 \\\\\n  11 & 11 & -7 \\\\\n  -9 & 10 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -10 + 2 - 9 + 11 + 11 - 7 - 9 + 10 + 5 = 4\n  Average = 4 / 9 ≈ 0.44\n\n- **Window 15 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & -9 & 15 \\\\\n  11 & -7 & 11 \\\\\n  10 & 5 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 2 - 9 + 15 + 11 - 7 + 11 + 10 + 5 - 6 = 32\n  Average = 32"
