    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     8, 8, 9, -3\n     14, 10, 12, -9\n     18, 11, 8, -10\n     18, 18, 6, 19\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - The number of windows vertically = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of 3x3 = 9 windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     - Elements: 8, 8, 14, 10\n     - Average: (8 + 8 + 14 + 10) / 4 = 10\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     - Elements: 8, 9, 10, 12\n     - Average: (8 + 9 + 10 + 12) / 4 = 9.75\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     - Elements: 9, -3, 12, -9\n     - Average: (9 - 3 + 12 - 9) / 4 = 2.25\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     - Elements: 14, 10, 18, 11\n     - Average: (14 + 10 + 18 + 11) / 4 = 13.25\n   - **Window 5 (Center)**:\n     - Elements: 10, 12, 11, 8\n     - Average: (10 + 12 + 11 + 8) / 4 = 10.25\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     - Elements: 12, -9, 8, -10\n     - Average: (12 - 9 + 8 - 10) / 4 = 0.25\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     - Elements: 18, 11, 18, 18\n     - Average: (18 + 11 + 18 + 18) / 4 = 16.25\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle)**:\n     - Elements: 11, 8, 18, 6\n     - Average: (11 + 8 + 18 + 6) / 4 = 10.75\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     - Elements: 8, -10, 6, 19\n     - Average: (8 - 10 + 6 + 19) / 4 = 5.75\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix, corresponding to the positions of the windows:\n     ```\n     10, 9.75, 2.25\n     13.25, 10.25, 0.25\n     16.25, 10.75, 5.75\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n10, 9.75, 2.25\n13.25, 10.25, 0.25\n16.25, 10.75, 5.75\n```"
