    "To solve this problem, we need to perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The matrix is 6x6, and we are using a 3x3 sliding window.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Sliding Window:**\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Arrange the Averages into a New Matrix:**\n   - The resulting averages will form a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations for each sliding window:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 8 & 3 \\\\\n  2 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n  -1 & 8 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((5 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 8 + 7 - 1 + 8 - 6) / 9 = 34 / 9 \\approx 3.78\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Top row, second position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 3 & 6 \\\\\n  8 & 7 & -2 \\\\\n  8 & -6 & 8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((8 + 3 + 6 + 8 + 7 - 2 + 8 - 6 + 8) / 9 = 40 / 9 \\approx 4.44\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Top row, third position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 6 & 3 \\\\\n  7 & -2 & 10 \\\\\n  -6 & 8 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((3 + 6 + 3 + 7 - 2 + 10 - 6 + 8 + 15) / 9 = 44 / 9 \\approx 4.89\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Top row, fourth position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  6 & 3 & 16 \\\\\n  -2 & 10 & 19 \\\\\n  8 & 15 & -3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((6 + 3 + 16 - 2 + 10 + 19 + 8 + 15 - 3) / 9 = 72 / 9 = 8.00\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Second row, first position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n  -1 & 8 & -6 \\\\\n  0 & -3 & 18 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((2 + 8 + 7 - 1 + 8 - 6 + 0 - 3 + 18) / 9 = 33 / 9 \\approx 3.67\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Second row, second position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 7 & -2 \\\\\n  8 & -6 & 8 \\\\\n  -3 & 18 & 2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((8 + 7 - 2 + 8 - 6 + 8 - 3 + 18 + 2) / 9 = 40 / 9 \\approx 4.44\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Second row, third position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  7 & -2 & 10 \\\\\n  -6 & 8 & 15 \\\\\n  18 & 2 & 12 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((7 - 2 + 10 - 6 + 8 + 15 + 18 + 2 + 12) / 9 = 64 / 9 \\approx 7.11\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Second row, fourth position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 10 & 19 \\\\\n  8 & 15 & -3 \\\\\n  2 & 12 & -4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(( -2 + 10 + 19 + 8 + 15 - 3 + 2 + 12 - 4) / 9 = 57 / 9 \\approx 6.33\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Third row, first position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -1 & 8 & -6 \\\\\n  0 & -3 & 18 \\\\\n  19 & 10 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-1 + 8 - 6 + 0 - 3 + 18 + 19 + 10 - 6) / 9 = 39 / 9 \\approx 4.33\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Third row, second position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & -6 & 8 \\\\\n  -3 & 18 & 2 \\\\\n  10 & -6 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((8 - 6 + 8 - 3 + 18 + 2 + 10 - 6 - 10) / 9 = 21 / 9 \\approx 2.33\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Third row, third position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -6 & 8 & 15 \\\\\n  18 & 2 & 12 \\\\\n  -6 & -10 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-6 + 8 + 15 + 18 + 2 + 12 - 6 - 10 + 1) / 9 = 34 / 9 \\approx 3.78\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Third row, fourth position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 15 & -3 \\\\\n  2 & 12 & -4 \\\\\n  -10 & 1 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((8 + 15 - 3 + 2 + 12 - 4 - 10 + 1 - 5) / 9 = 16 / 9 \\approx 1.78\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Fourth row, first position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & -3 & 18 \\\\\n  19 & 10 & -6 \\\\\n  16 & 8 & 20 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((0 - 3 + 18 + 19 + 10 - 6 + 16 + 8 + 20) / 9 = 82 / 9 \\approx 9.11\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Fourth row, second position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -3 & 18 & 2 \\\\\n  10 & -6 & -10 \\\\\n  8 & 20 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-3 + 18 + 2 + 10 - 6 - 10 + 8 + 20 + 1) / 9 = 40 / 9 \\approx 4.44\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Fourth row, third position):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  18 & 2 & 12 \\\\\n  -6 & -10 & 1 \\\\\n  20 & 1 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((18 + 2 + 12 - 6 - 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 - 10) / 9 = 28 / 9 \\approx 3.11\\)\n\n"
