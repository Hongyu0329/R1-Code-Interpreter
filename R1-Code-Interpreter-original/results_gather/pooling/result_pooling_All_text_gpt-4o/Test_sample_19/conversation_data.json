    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     4, -2, -2, -3\n     -8, 17, 1, 19\n     15, 14, -9, 7\n     -9, 3, 3, 19\n     ```\n   - We will use a 2x2 sliding window to perform max pooling.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of positions the sliding window can take horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the sliding window can take vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling for Each Sliding Window:**\n   - For each position of the sliding window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n\n   - **Sliding Window Positions and Max Values:**\n     1. **Top-left corner (0,0):**\n        ```\n        4, -2\n        -8, 17\n        ```\n        Max value = 17\n\n     2. **Top-middle (0,1):**\n        ```\n        -2, -2\n        17, 1\n        ```\n        Max value = 17\n\n     3. **Top-right corner (0,2):**\n        ```\n        -2, -3\n        1, 19\n        ```\n        Max value = 19\n\n     4. **Middle-left (1,0):**\n        ```\n        -8, 17\n        15, 14\n        ```\n        Max value = 17\n\n     5. **Center (1,1):**\n        ```\n        17, 1\n        14, -9\n        ```\n        Max value = 17\n\n     6. **Middle-right (1,2):**\n        ```\n        1, 19\n        -9, 7\n        ```\n        Max value = 19\n\n     7. **Bottom-left (2,0):**\n        ```\n        15, 14\n        -9, 3\n        ```\n        Max value = 15\n\n     8. **Bottom-middle (2,1):**\n        ```\n        14, -9\n        3, 3\n        ```\n        Max value = 14\n\n     9. **Bottom-right (2,2):**\n        ```\n        -9, 7\n        3, 19\n        ```\n        Max value = 19\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values according to their original positions in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     17, 17, 19\n     17, 17, 19\n     15, 14, 19\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window, is:\n```\n17, 17, 19\n17, 17, 19\n15, 14, 19\n```"
