    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The original matrix is 5x5.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window:**\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages:**\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -7 & -5 & 19 \\\\\n     4 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n     11 & -5 & -4\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-7 + (-5) + 19 + 4 + 0 + (-7) + 11 + (-5) + (-4)}{9} = \\frac{6}{9} = 0.67\\)\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -5 & 19 & -10 \\\\\n     0 & -7 & 2 \\\\\n     -5 & -4 & 11\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-5 + 19 + (-10) + 0 + (-7) + 2 + (-5) + (-4) + 11}{9} = \\frac{1}{9} = 0.11\\)\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     19 & -10 & 12 \\\\\n     -7 & 2 & -10 \\\\\n     -4 & 11 & 6\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{19 + (-10) + 12 + (-7) + 2 + (-10) + (-4) + 11 + 6}{9} = \\frac{19}{9} = 2.11\\)\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     4 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n     11 & -5 & -4 \\\\\n     2 & 10 & -7\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{4 + 0 + (-7) + 11 + (-5) + (-4) + 2 + 10 + (-7)}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} = 0.44\\)\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & -7 & 2 \\\\\n     -5 & -4 & 11 \\\\\n     10 & -7 & -4\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{0 + (-7) + 2 + (-5) + (-4) + 11 + 10 + (-7) + (-4)}{9} = \\frac{-4}{9} = -0.44\\)\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -7 & 2 & -10 \\\\\n     -4 & 11 & 6 \\\\\n     -7 & -4 & 18\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-7 + 2 + (-10) + (-4) + 11 + 6 + (-7) + (-4) + 18}{9} = \\frac{5}{9} = 0.56\\)\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     11 & -5 & -4 \\\\\n     2 & 10 & -7 \\\\\n     6 & 13 & 5\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{11 + (-5) + (-4) + 2 + 10 + (-7) + 6 + 13 + 5}{9} = \\frac{31}{9} = 3.44\\)\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -5 & -4 & 11 \\\\\n     10 & -7 & -4 \\\\\n     13 & 5 & 6\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-5 + (-4) + 11 + 10 + (-7) + (-4) + 13 + 5 + 6}{9} = \\frac{25}{9} = 2.78\\)\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -4 & 11 & 6 \\\\\n     -7 & -4 & 18 \\\\\n     5 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-4 + 11 + 6 + (-7) + (-4) + 18 + 5 + 6 + 2}{9} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.67\\)\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix according to the positions of the windows.\n\nThe final 3x3 matrix after average pooling is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.67 & 0.11 & 2.11 \\\\\n0.44 & -0.44 & 0.56 \\\\\n3.44 & 2.78 & 3.67\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
