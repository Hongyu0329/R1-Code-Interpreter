    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The original matrix is 5x5.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 12 & 3 \\\\\n     -1 & -1 & -7 \\\\\n     20 & -8 & -3 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((0 + 12 + 3 - 1 - 1 - 7 + 20 - 8 - 3) / 9 = 15 / 9 = 1.67\\)\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     12 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n     -1 & -7 & 10 \\\\\n     -8 & -3 & -10 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((12 + 3 + 2 - 1 - 7 + 10 - 8 - 3 - 10) / 9 = -2 / 9 = -0.22\\)\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 2 & -9 \\\\\n     -7 & 10 & 1 \\\\\n     -3 & -10 & -6 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((3 + 2 - 9 - 7 + 10 + 1 - 3 - 10 - 6) / 9 = -19 / 9 = -2.11\\)\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -1 & -1 & -7 \\\\\n     20 & -8 & -3 \\\\\n     12 & -4 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((-1 - 1 - 7 + 20 - 8 - 3 + 12 - 4 + 5) / 9 = 13 / 9 = 1.44\\)\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -1 & -7 & 10 \\\\\n     -8 & -3 & -10 \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 3 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((-1 - 7 + 10 - 8 - 3 - 10 - 4 + 5 + 3) / 9 = -15 / 9 = -1.67\\)\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -7 & 10 & 1 \\\\\n     -3 & -10 & -6 \\\\\n     5 & 3 & 13 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((-7 + 10 + 1 - 3 - 10 - 6 + 5 + 3 + 13) / 9 = 6 / 9 = 0.67\\)\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     20 & -8 & -3 \\\\\n     12 & -4 & 5 \\\\\n     12 & 12 & 15 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((20 - 8 - 3 + 12 - 4 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 15) / 9 = 61 / 9 = 6.78\\)\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -8 & -3 & -10 \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 3 \\\\\n     12 & 15 & 3 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((-8 - 3 - 10 - 4 + 5 + 3 + 12 + 15 + 3) / 9 = 13 / 9 = 1.44\\)\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -3 & -10 & -6 \\\\\n     5 & 3 & 13 \\\\\n     15 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((-3 - 10 - 6 + 5 + 3 + 13 + 15 + 3 + 0) / 9 = 20 / 9 = 2.22\\)\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix as per the sliding window positions:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1.67 & -0.22 & -2.11 \\\\\n     1.44 & -1.67 & 0.67 \\\\\n     6.78 & 1.44 & 2.22 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.67 & -0.22 & -2.11 \\\\\n1.44 & -1.67 & 0.67 \\\\\n6.78 & 1.44 & 2.22 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
