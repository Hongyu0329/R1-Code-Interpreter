    "To perform max pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     -4, 11, 19, 19\n     -8, -8, 1, -5\n     -10, 4, -6, 13\n     -4, 17, -4, -10\n     ```\n   - We will use a 2x2 sliding window to find the maximum value in each window.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N-n+1) where N is the size of the matrix and n is the size of the sliding window.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix and a 2x2 window, the number of windows is (4-2+1) = 3 in both directions.\n\n3. **Slide the Window and Find Maximums:**\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each window.\n   - The windows and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **First Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       -4, 11\n       -8, -8\n       ```\n       Maximum = 11\n     - Window 2:\n       ```\n       11, 19\n       -8, 1\n       ```\n       Maximum = 19\n     - Window 3:\n       ```\n       19, 19\n       1, -5\n       ```\n       Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 4:\n       ```\n       -8, -8\n       -10, 4\n       ```\n       Maximum = 4\n     - Window 5:\n       ```\n       -8, 1\n       4, -6\n       ```\n       Maximum = 4\n     - Window 6:\n       ```\n       1, -5\n       -6, 13\n       ```\n       Maximum = 13\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 7:\n       ```\n       -10, 4\n       -4, 17\n       ```\n       Maximum = 17\n     - Window 8:\n       ```\n       4, -6\n       17, -4\n       ```\n       Maximum = 17\n     - Window 9:\n       ```\n       -6, 13\n       -4, -10\n       ```\n       Maximum = 13\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values in the order of their original positions to form a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     11, 19, 19\n     4, 4, 13\n     17, 17, 13\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after max pooling, is:\n```\n11, 19, 19\n4, 4, 13\n17, 17, 13\n```"
