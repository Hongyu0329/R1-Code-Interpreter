    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window:**\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix:**\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix:**\n   - The resulting matrix will be 4x4, as there are 4 possible positions horizontally and 4 vertically.\n\nLet's calculate the averages for each window:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -7 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  8 & 10 & 8 \\\\\n  8 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-7 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 8}{9} = \\frac{40}{9} \\approx 4.44\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 0 & -6 \\\\\n  10 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n  4 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{1 + 0 - 6 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 8 + 9}{9} = \\frac{42}{9} \\approx 4.67\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & -6 & -9 \\\\\n  8 & 8 & -4 \\\\\n  8 & 9 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{0 - 6 - 9 + 8 + 8 - 4 + 8 + 9 - 1}{9} = \\frac{13}{9} \\approx 1.44\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -6 & -9 & -5 \\\\\n  8 & -4 & -9 \\\\\n  9 & -1 & -3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-6 - 9 - 5 + 8 - 4 - 9 + 9 - 1 - 3}{9} = \\frac{-20}{9} \\approx -2.22\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 10 & 8 \\\\\n  8 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n  2 & 16 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{8 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 16 + 5}{9} = \\frac{69}{9} \\approx 7.67\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n  4 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n  16 & 5 & -4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{10 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 8 + 9 + 16 + 5 - 4}{9} = \\frac{64}{9} \\approx 7.11\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 8 & -4 \\\\\n  8 & 9 & -1 \\\\\n  5 & -4 & 8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{8 + 8 - 4 + 8 + 9 - 1 + 5 - 4 + 8}{9} = \\frac{37}{9} \\approx 4.11\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & -4 & -9 \\\\\n  9 & -1 & -3 \\\\\n  -4 & 8 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{8 - 4 - 9 + 9 - 1 - 3 - 4 + 8 - 9}{9} = \\frac{-5}{9} \\approx -0.56\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n  2 & 16 & 5 \\\\\n  -1 & 17 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{8 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 16 + 5 - 1 + 17 + 1}{9} = \\frac{60}{9} \\approx 6.67\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n  16 & 5 & -4 \\\\\n  17 & 1 & -4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{4 + 8 + 9 + 16 + 5 - 4 + 17 + 1 - 4}{9} = \\frac{52}{9} \\approx 5.78\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 9 & -1 \\\\\n  5 & -4 & 8 \\\\\n  1 & -4 & -7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{8 + 9 - 1 + 5 - 4 + 8 + 1 - 4 - 7}{9} = \\frac{15}{9} \\approx 1.67\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & -1 & -3 \\\\\n  -4 & 8 & -9 \\\\\n  -4 & -7 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{9 - 1 - 3 - 4 + 8 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 2}{9} = \\frac{-13}{9} \\approx -1.44\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 16 & 5 \\\\\n  -1 & 17 & 1 \\\\\n  19 & 18 & 7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{2 + 16 + 5 - 1 + 17 + 1 + 19 + 18 + 7}{9} = \\frac{84}{9} \\approx 9.33\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  16 & 5 & -4 \\\\\n  17 & 1 & -4 \\\\\n  18 & 7 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{16 + 5 - 4 + 17 + 1 - 4 + 18 + 7 - 9}{9} = \\frac{47}{9} \\approx 5.22\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Slide right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & -4 & 8 \\\\\n  1 & -4 & -7 \\\\\n  7 & -9 & 13 \\\\\n"
