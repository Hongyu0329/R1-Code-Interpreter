  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n11, 0, -1\n-3, 20, 8\n-2, -7, 12\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 grid:\n     ```\n     11, 0, -1\n     -3, 20, 8\n     -2, -7, 12\n     ```\n   - We will use a 2x2 sliding window to perform max pooling.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the original matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The sliding window can start at the following top-left positions:\n     - (0,0), (0,1)\n     - (1,0), (1,1)\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum Value for Each Sliding Window:**\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     11, 0\n     -3, 20\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     0, -1\n     20, 8\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     -3, 20\n     -2, -7\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     ```\n     20, 8\n     -7, 12\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values according to their original positions in the sliding windows:\n     ```\n     20, 20\n     20, 20\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The resulting matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n     ```\n     20, 20\n     20, 20\n     ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n20, 20\n20, 20"
