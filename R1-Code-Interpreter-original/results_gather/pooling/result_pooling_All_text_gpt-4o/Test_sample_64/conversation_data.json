    "To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     7, 18, 18, -4\n     12, 6, 14, -6\n     1, -2, -8, 3\n     20, 16, 9, -6\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means we will calculate the average of each 2x2 sub-matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Sliding Window**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n\n   - **Position (0,0):**\n     ```\n     7, 18\n     12, 6\n     ```\n     Average = (7 + 18 + 12 + 6) / 4 = 43 / 4 = 10.75\n\n   - **Position (0,1):**\n     ```\n     18, 18\n     6, 14\n     ```\n     Average = (18 + 18 + 6 + 14) / 4 = 56 / 4 = 14\n\n   - **Position (0,2):**\n     ```\n     18, -4\n     14, -6\n     ```\n     Average = (18 - 4 + 14 - 6) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5\n\n   - **Position (1,0):**\n     ```\n     12, 6\n     1, -2\n     ```\n     Average = (12 + 6 + 1 - 2) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25\n\n   - **Position (1,1):**\n     ```\n     6, 14\n     -2, -8\n     ```\n     Average = (6 + 14 - 2 - 8) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\n\n   - **Position (1,2):**\n     ```\n     14, -6\n     -8, 3\n     ```\n     Average = (14 - 6 - 8 + 3) / 4 = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n\n   - **Position (2,0):**\n     ```\n     1, -2\n     20, 16\n     ```\n     Average = (1 - 2 + 20 + 16) / 4 = 35 / 4 = 8.75\n\n   - **Position (2,1):**\n     ```\n     -2, -8\n     16, 9\n     ```\n     Average = (-2 - 8 + 16 + 9) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n\n   - **Position (2,2):**\n     ```\n     -8, 3\n     9, -6\n     ```\n     Average = (-8 + 3 + 9 - 6) / 4 = -2 / 4 = -0.5\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix, corresponding to the positions of the sliding windows:\n     ```\n     10.75, 14, 5.5\n     4.25, 2.5, 0.75\n     8.75, 3.75, -0.5\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n```\n10.75, 14, 5.5\n4.25, 2.5, 0.75\n8.75, 3.75, -0.5\n```"
