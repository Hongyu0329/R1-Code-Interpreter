    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, sum all the elements and divide by 9 (since there are 9 elements in a 3x3 window).\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting matrix will be 4x4, as there are 16 windows.\n\nLet's perform the calculations for each window:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  13 & -9 & -3 \\\\\n  16 & 1 & 18 \\\\\n  17 & -8 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((13 + (-9) + (-3) + 16 + 1 + 18 + 17 + (-8) + (-1)) / 9 = 44 / 9 \\approx 4.89\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Shift right by 1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -9 & -3 & 17 \\\\\n  1 & 18 & 12 \\\\\n  -8 & -1 & 10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-9 + (-3) + 17 + 1 + 18 + 12 + (-8) + (-1) + 10) / 9 = 37 / 9 \\approx 4.11\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Shift right by 2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -3 & 17 & 2 \\\\\n  18 & 12 & -8 \\\\\n  -1 & 10 & 2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-3 + 17 + 2 + 18 + 12 + (-8) + (-1) + 10 + 2) / 9 = 49 / 9 \\approx 5.44\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Shift right by 3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & 2 & -7 \\\\\n  12 & -8 & 2 \\\\\n  10 & 2 & 18 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((17 + 2 + (-7) + 12 + (-8) + 2 + 10 + 2 + 18) / 9 = 48 / 9 \\approx 5.33\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down one row, start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  16 & 1 & 18 \\\\\n  17 & -8 & -1 \\\\\n  -5 & 4 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((16 + 1 + 18 + 17 + (-8) + (-1) + (-5) + 4 + (-2)) / 9 = 40 / 9 \\approx 4.44\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Shift right by 1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 18 & 12 \\\\\n  -8 & -1 & 10 \\\\\n  4 & -2 & 12 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((1 + 18 + 12 + (-8) + (-1) + 10 + 4 + (-2) + 12) / 9 = 46 / 9 \\approx 5.11\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Shift right by 2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  18 & 12 & -8 \\\\\n  -1 & 10 & 2 \\\\\n  -2 & 12 & -4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((18 + 12 + (-8) + (-1) + 10 + 2 + (-2) + 12 + (-4)) / 9 = 39 / 9 \\approx 4.33\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Shift right by 3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & -8 & 2 \\\\\n  10 & 2 & 18 \\\\\n  12 & -4 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((12 + (-8) + 2 + 10 + 2 + 18 + 12 + (-4) + (-9)) / 9 = 35 / 9 \\approx 3.89\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down one row, start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & -8 & -1 \\\\\n  -5 & 4 & -2 \\\\\n  -2 & -4 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((17 + (-8) + (-1) + (-5) + 4 + (-2) + (-2) + (-4) + 6) / 9 = 5 / 9 \\approx 0.56\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Shift right by 1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & -1 & 10 \\\\\n  4 & -2 & 12 \\\\\n  -4 & 6 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(((-8) + (-1) + 10 + 4 + (-2) + 12 + (-4) + 6 + (-1)) / 9 = 16 / 9 \\approx 1.78\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Shift right by 2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -1 & 10 & 2 \\\\\n  -2 & 12 & -4 \\\\\n  6 & -1 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(((-1) + 10 + 2 + (-2) + 12 + (-4) + 6 + (-1) + (-5)) / 9 = 17 / 9 \\approx 1.89\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Shift right by 3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 2 & 18 \\\\\n  12 & -4 & -9 \\\\\n  -1 & -5 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((10 + 2 + 18 + 12 + (-4) + (-9) + (-1) + (-5) + 4) / 9 = 27 / 9 \\approx 3.00\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down one row, start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & 4 & -2 \\\\\n  -2 & -4 & 6 \\\\\n  3 & 7 & 11 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(((-5) + 4 + (-2) + (-2) + (-4) + 6 + 3 + 7 + 11) / 9 = 18 / 9 = 2.00\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Shift right by 1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & -2 & 12 \\\\\n  -4 & 6 & -1 \\\\\n  7 & 11 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((4 + (-2) + 12 + (-4) + 6 + (-1) + 7 + 11 + (-6)) / 9 = 27 / 9 = 3.00\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Shift right by 2)**:\n  \\[\n"
