    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - Horizontally, the window can start at columns 0, 1, and 2 (3 positions).\n   - Vertically, the window can start at rows 0, 1, and 2 (3 positions).\n   - This results in a total of 3x3 = 9 sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each sliding window, find the maximum value within that 3x3 section of the matrix.\n   - Record the maximum value in a new matrix that corresponds to the position of the sliding window.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Sliding Window**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     -4, -9, -1\n     13,  0,  8\n      0, 19, -6\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     -9, -1,  7\n      0,  8,  8\n     19, -6,  0\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     ```\n     -1,  7, -8\n      8,  8,  9\n     -6,  0, 19\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     13,  0,  8\n      0, 19, -6\n      7, 12, 12\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     ```\n      0,  8,  8\n     19, -6,  0\n     12, 12, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     ```\n      8,  8,  9\n     -6,  0, 19\n     12, -1, -3\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     ```\n      0, 19, -6\n      7, 12, 12\n      9, -5,  5\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     ```\n     19, -6,  0\n     12, 12, -1\n     -5,  5, 11\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     ```\n     -6,  0, 19\n     12, -1, -3\n      5, 11,  0\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix according to the positions of the sliding windows:\n     ```\n     19, 19, 19\n     19, 19, 19\n     19, 19, 19\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling with a 3x3 sliding window, is:\n```\n<<<19, 19, 19>, <19, 19, 19>, <19, 19, 19>>>\n```"
