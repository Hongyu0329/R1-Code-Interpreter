  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n9, -9, 4, -3\n-1, -8, 15, 7\n11, 13, -9, 17\n20, 15, 20, -7\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     9,  -9,  4, -3\n     -1, -8, 15,  7\n     11, 13, -9, 17\n     20, 15, 20, -7\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N-n+1) where N is the matrix size and n is the window size. Here, N=4 and n=2, so we have (4-2+1) = 3 windows in each direction.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each window.\n   - The windows and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **First Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       9, -9\n       -1, -8\n       ```\n       Max value = 9\n\n     - Window 2:\n       ```\n       -9, 4\n       -8, 15\n       ```\n       Max value = 15\n\n     - Window 3:\n       ```\n       4, -3\n       15, 7\n       ```\n       Max value = 15\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 4:\n       ```\n       11, 13\n       20, 15\n       ```\n       Max value = 20\n\n     - Window 5:\n       ```\n       13, -9\n       15, 20\n       ```\n       Max value = 20\n\n     - Window 6:\n       ```\n       -9, 17\n       20, -7\n       ```\n       Max value = 20\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values from each window into a new matrix, maintaining the order of the windows:\n     ```\n     9, 15, 15\n     20, 20, 20\n     ```\n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n```\n9, 15, 15\n20, 20, 20\n```"
