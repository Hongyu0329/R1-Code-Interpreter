    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of possible starting positions for the sliding window.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each starting position, calculate the average of the 3x3 window.\n   - The average is calculated by summing all the numbers in the window and dividing by 9 (since there are 9 numbers in a 3x3 window).\n\n4. **Perform Calculations**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6 + 6 - 10 - 7 + 15 - 7 + 12 - 3 - 4}{9} = \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.89\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6 - 10 - 3 + 15 - 7 + 4 - 3 - 4 + 5}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} = 0.33\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-10 - 3 - 7 - 7 + 4 + 20 - 4 + 5 + 12}{9} = \\frac{14}{9} \\approx 1.56\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-7 + 15 - 7 + 12 - 3 - 4 + 17 + 12 + 20}{9} = \\frac{55}{9} \\approx 6.11\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 - 7 + 4 - 3 - 4 + 5 + 12 + 20 - 6}{9} = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-7 + 4 + 20 - 4 + 5 + 12 + 20 - 6 - 5}{9} = \\frac{39}{9} \\approx 4.33\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{12 - 3 - 4 + 17 + 12 + 20 + 3 + 0 - 3}{9} = \\frac{54}{9} = 6\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-3 - 4 + 5 + 12 + 20 - 6 + 0 - 3 - 6}{9} = \\frac{15}{9} \\approx 1.67\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-4 + 5 + 12 + 20 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 6 + 17}{9} = \\frac{30}{9} \\approx 3.33\n     \\]\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix according to their starting positions:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0.89 & 0.33 & 1.56 \\\\\n     6.11 & 4 & 4.33 \\\\\n     6 & 1.67 & 3.33\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.89 & 0.33 & 1.56 \\\\\n6.11 & 4 & 4.33 \\\\\n6 & 1.67 & 3.33\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
