    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, meaning there will be 9 windows in total.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, sum all the elements and divide by 9 to get the average.\n   - The windows and their averages are calculated as follows:\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -2 & 16 & 3 \\\\\n     14 & -9 & -6 \\\\\n     18 & -10 & -4 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-2 + 16 + 3 + 14 - 9 - 6 + 18 - 10 - 4}{9} = \\frac{20}{9} \\approx 2.22\\)\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     16 & 3 & -4 \\\\\n     -9 & -6 & -5 \\\\\n     -10 & -4 & 15 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{16 + 3 - 4 - 9 - 6 - 5 - 10 - 4 + 15}{9} = \\frac{-4}{9} \\approx -0.44\\)\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & -4 & 13 \\\\\n     -6 & -5 & 1 \\\\\n     -4 & 15 & 20 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{3 - 4 + 13 - 6 - 5 + 1 - 4 + 15 + 20}{9} = \\frac{33}{9} \\approx 3.67\\)\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     14 & -9 & -6 \\\\\n     18 & -10 & -4 \\\\\n     7 & 4 & 18 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{14 - 9 - 6 + 18 - 10 - 4 + 7 + 4 + 18}{9} = \\frac{32}{9} \\approx 3.56\\)\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -9 & -6 & -5 \\\\\n     -10 & -4 & 15 \\\\\n     4 & 18 & 20 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-9 - 6 - 5 - 10 - 4 + 15 + 4 + 18 + 20}{9} = \\frac{23}{9} \\approx 2.56\\)\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -6 & -5 & 1 \\\\\n     -4 & 15 & 20 \\\\\n     18 & 20 & 14 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-6 - 5 + 1 - 4 + 15 + 20 + 18 + 20 + 14}{9} = \\frac{73}{9} \\approx 8.11\\)\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     18 & -10 & -4 \\\\\n     7 & 4 & 18 \\\\\n     19 & 14 & -5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{18 - 10 - 4 + 7 + 4 + 18 + 19 + 14 - 5}{9} = \\frac{61}{9} \\approx 6.78\\)\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -10 & -4 & 15 \\\\\n     4 & 18 & 20 \\\\\n     14 & -5 & -1 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-10 - 4 + 15 + 4 + 18 + 20 + 14 - 5 - 1}{9} = \\frac{51}{9} \\approx 5.67\\)\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -4 & 15 & 20 \\\\\n     18 & 20 & 14 \\\\\n     -5 & -1 & 16 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\(\\frac{-4 + 15 + 20 + 18 + 20 + 14 - 5 - 1 + 16}{9} = \\frac{93}{9} \\approx 10.33\\)\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix, corresponding to the starting positions of each window:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2.22 & -0.44 & 3.67 \\\\\n3.56 & 2.56 & 8.11 \\\\\n6.78 & 5.67 & 10.33 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2.22 & -0.44 & 3.67 \\\\\n3.56 & 2.56 & 8.11 \\\\\n6.78 & 5.67 & 10.33 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
