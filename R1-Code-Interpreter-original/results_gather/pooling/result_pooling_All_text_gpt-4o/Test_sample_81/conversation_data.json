    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, each producing one average value.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, sum all the numbers within the window and divide by 9 (since there are 9 numbers in a 3x3 window).\n\n4. **Perform Calculations**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 + 5 + 7 + (-10) + 19 + 14 + (-5) + 16 + 15}{9} = \\frac{76}{9} \\approx 8.44\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5 + 7 + 1 + 19 + 14 + 0 + 16 + 15 + (-9)}{9} = \\frac{68}{9} \\approx 7.56\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7 + 1 + (-6) + 14 + 0 + 0 + 15 + (-9) + 16}{9} = \\frac{38}{9} \\approx 4.22\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-10 + 19 + 14 + (-5) + 16 + 15 + 12 + (-3) + 3}{9} = \\frac{61}{9} \\approx 6.78\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{19 + 14 + 0 + 16 + 15 + (-9) + (-3) + 3 + 9}{9} = \\frac{64}{9} \\approx 7.11\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{14 + 0 + 0 + 15 + (-9) + 16 + 3 + 9 + 12}{9} = \\frac{60}{9} \\approx 6.67\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-5 + 16 + 15 + 12 + (-3) + 3 + 9 + 7 + 8}{9} = \\frac{62}{9} \\approx 6.89\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{16 + 15 + (-9) + (-3) + 3 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 16}{9} = \\frac{62}{9} \\approx 6.89\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 + (-9) + 16 + 3 + 9 + 12 + 8 + 16 + (-2)}{9} = \\frac{68}{9} \\approx 7.56\n     \\]\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     8.44 & 7.56 & 4.22 \\\\\n     6.78 & 7.11 & 6.67 \\\\\n     6.89 & 6.89 & 7.56\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n8.44 & 7.56 & 4.22 \\\\\n6.78 & 7.11 & 6.67 \\\\\n6.89 & 6.89 & 7.56\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
