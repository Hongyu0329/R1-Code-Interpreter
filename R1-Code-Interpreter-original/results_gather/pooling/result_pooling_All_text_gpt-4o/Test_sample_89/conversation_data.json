    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages from each window will form a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -4 & 10 & 7 \\\\\n  -5 & 13 & -3 \\\\\n  -1 & 5 & 19 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-4 + 10 + 7 - 5 + 13 - 3 - 1 + 5 + 19}{9} = \\frac{41}{9} \\approx 4.56\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 7 & 14 \\\\\n  13 & -3 & -5 \\\\\n  5 & 19 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{10 + 7 + 14 + 13 - 3 - 5 + 5 + 19 + 5}{9} = \\frac{65}{9} \\approx 7.22\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  7 & 14 & 6 \\\\\n  -3 & -5 & 1 \\\\\n  19 & 5 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{7 + 14 + 6 - 3 - 5 + 1 + 19 + 5 + 16}{9} = \\frac{60}{9} \\approx 6.67\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & 6 & 5 \\\\\n  -5 & 1 & 11 \\\\\n  5 & 16 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{14 + 6 + 5 - 5 + 1 + 11 + 5 + 16 + 15}{9} = \\frac{68}{9} \\approx 7.56\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & 13 & -3 \\\\\n  -1 & 5 & 19 \\\\\n  9 & 0 & -8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-5 + 13 - 3 - 1 + 5 + 19 + 9 + 0 - 8}{9} = \\frac{29}{9} \\approx 3.22\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  13 & -3 & -5 \\\\\n  5 & 19 & 5 \\\\\n  0 & -8 & 19 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{13 - 3 - 5 + 5 + 19 + 5 + 0 - 8 + 19}{9} = \\frac{45}{9} = 5.00\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -3 & -5 & 1 \\\\\n  19 & 5 & 16 \\\\\n  -8 & 19 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-3 - 5 + 1 + 19 + 5 + 16 - 8 + 19 + 6}{9} = \\frac{50}{9} \\approx 5.56\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & 1 & 11 \\\\\n  5 & 16 & 15 \\\\\n  19 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-5 + 1 + 11 + 5 + 16 + 15 + 19 + 6 + 6}{9} = \\frac{74}{9} \\approx 8.22\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -1 & 5 & 19 \\\\\n  9 & 0 & -8 \\\\\n  1 & 12 & 8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-1 + 5 + 19 + 9 + 0 - 8 + 1 + 12 + 8}{9} = \\frac{45}{9} = 5.00\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 19 & 5 \\\\\n  0 & -8 & 19 \\\\\n  12 & 8 & 3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{5 + 19 + 5 + 0 - 8 + 19 + 12 + 8 + 3}{9} = \\frac{63}{9} = 7.00\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 5 & 16 \\\\\n  -8 & 19 & 6 \\\\\n  8 & 3 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{19 + 5 + 16 - 8 + 19 + 6 + 8 + 3 - 10}{9} = \\frac{58}{9} \\approx 6.44\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 16 & 15 \\\\\n  19 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n  3 & -10 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{5 + 16 + 15 + 19 + 6 + 6 + 3 - 10 + 15}{9} = \\frac{75}{9} \\approx 8.33\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & 0 & -8 \\\\\n  1 & 12 & 8 \\\\\n  -5 & 14 & 18 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{9 + 0 - 8 + 1 + 12 + 8 - 5 + 14 + 18}{9} = \\frac{49}{9} \\approx 5.44\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & -8 & 19 \\\\\n  12 & 8 & 3 \\\\\n  14 & 18 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{0 - 8 + 19 + 12 + 8 + 3 + 14 + 18 + 16}{9} = \\frac{82}{9} \\approx 9.11\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & 19 & 6 \\\\\n  8 & 3 & -10 \\\\\n  18 & 16 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average ="
