    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages from each window will form a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  7 & 4 & 11 \\\\\n  14 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n  5 & 8 & 14 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((7 + 4 + 11 + 14 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 8 + 14) / 9 = 67 / 9 \\approx 7.44\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & 11 & 15 \\\\\n  3 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  8 & 14 & -8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((4 + 11 + 15 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 14 - 8) / 9 = 48 / 9 \\approx 5.33\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 15 & 18 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 19 \\\\\n  14 & -8 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((11 + 15 + 18 + 1 + 0 + 19 + 14 - 8 - 10) / 9 = 60 / 9 \\approx 6.67\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  15 & 18 & 2 \\\\\n  0 & 19 & 11 \\\\\n  -8 & -10 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((15 + 18 + 2 + 0 + 19 + 11 - 8 - 10 + 15) / 9 = 62 / 9 \\approx 6.89\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down and start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n  5 & 8 & 14 \\\\\n  -7 & -9 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((14 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 8 + 14 - 7 - 9 + 9) / 9 = 38 / 9 \\approx 4.22\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  8 & 14 & -8 \\\\\n  -9 & 9 & -8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((3 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 14 - 8 - 9 + 9 - 8) / 9 = 10 / 9 \\approx 1.11\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 0 & 19 \\\\\n  14 & -8 & -10 \\\\\n  9 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((1 + 0 + 19 + 14 - 8 - 10 + 9 - 8 + 9) / 9 = 26 / 9 \\approx 2.89\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 19 & 11 \\\\\n  -8 & -10 & 15 \\\\\n  -8 & 9 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((0 + 19 + 11 - 8 - 10 + 15 - 8 + 9 - 6) / 9 = 22 / 9 \\approx 2.44\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down and start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 8 & 14 \\\\\n  -7 & -9 & 9 \\\\\n  20 & 5 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((5 + 8 + 14 - 7 - 9 + 9 + 20 + 5 + 9) / 9 = 54 / 9 = 6.00\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 14 & -8 \\\\\n  -9 & 9 & -8 \\\\\n  5 & 9 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((8 + 14 - 8 - 9 + 9 - 8 + 5 + 9 + 1) / 9 = 21 / 9 \\approx 2.33\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & -8 & -10 \\\\\n  9 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n  9 & 1 & 8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((14 - 8 - 10 + 9 - 8 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 8) / 9 = 24 / 9 \\approx 2.67\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & -10 & 15 \\\\\n  -8 & 9 & -6 \\\\\n  1 & 8 & 19 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-8 - 10 + 15 - 8 + 9 - 6 + 1 + 8 + 19) / 9 = 20 / 9 \\approx 2.22\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down and start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -7 & -9 & 9 \\\\\n  20 & 5 & 9 \\\\\n  16 & 12 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-7 - 9 + 9 + 20 + 5 + 9 + 16 + 12 - 10) / 9 = 45 / 9 = 5.00\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -9 & 9 & -8 \\\\\n  5 & 9 & 1 \\\\\n  12 & -10 & 2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-9 + 9 - 8 + 5 + 9 + 1 + 12 - 10 + 2) / 9 = 11 / 9 \\approx 1.22\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n  9 & 1 & 8 \\\\\n  -10 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((9 - 8 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 8 - 10 + 2 + 6)"
