    "To perform average pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     17, 8, 5, 8\n     10, -6, -6, 4\n     0, 4, 16, -9\n     17, 7, 6, -8\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - The number of windows vertically = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of 3x3 = 9 windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window:**\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages:**\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n     ```\n     17, 8\n     10, -6\n     ```\n     Average = (17 + 8 + 10 - 6) / 4 = 29 / 4 = 7.25\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle):**\n     ```\n     8, 5\n     -6, -6\n     ```\n     Average = (8 + 5 - 6 - 6) / 4 = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner):**\n     ```\n     5, 8\n     -6, 4\n     ```\n     Average = (5 + 8 - 6 + 4) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left):**\n     ```\n     10, -6\n     0, 4\n     ```\n     Average = (10 - 6 + 0 + 4) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2.0\n\n   - **Window 5 (Center):**\n     ```\n     -6, -6\n     4, 16\n     ```\n     Average = (-6 - 6 + 4 + 16) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2.0\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right):**\n     ```\n     -6, 4\n     16, -9\n     ```\n     Average = (-6 + 4 + 16 - 9) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left):**\n     ```\n     0, 4\n     17, 7\n     ```\n     Average = (0 + 4 + 17 + 7) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7.0\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle):**\n     ```\n     4, 16\n     7, 6\n     ```\n     Average = (4 + 16 + 7 + 6) / 4 = 33 / 4 = 8.25\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner):**\n     ```\n     16, -9\n     6, -8\n     ```\n     Average = (16 - 9 + 6 - 8) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     7.25, 0.25, 2.75\n     2.0, 2.0, 1.25\n     7.0, 8.25, 1.25\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n```\n7.25, 0.25, 2.75\n2.0, 2.0, 1.25\n7.0, 8.25, 1.25\n```"
