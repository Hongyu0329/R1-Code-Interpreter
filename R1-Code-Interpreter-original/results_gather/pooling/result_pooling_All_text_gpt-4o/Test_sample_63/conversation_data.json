    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     20, 8, 7, -1\n     12, 3, -2, -3\n     5, 4, 18, -10\n     2, 10, -7, 6\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - The number of windows vertically = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of 3x3 = 9 windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     20, 8\n     12, 3\n     Average = (20 + 8 + 12 + 3) / 4 = 43 / 4 = 10.75\n     ```\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     ```\n     8, 7\n     3, -2\n     Average = (8 + 7 + 3 - 2) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4\n     ```\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     7, -1\n     -2, -3\n     Average = (7 - 1 - 2 - 3) / 4 = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n     ```\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     12, 3\n     5, 4\n     Average = (12 + 3 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6\n     ```\n   - **Window 5 (Center)**:\n     ```\n     3, -2\n     4, 18\n     Average = (3 - 2 + 4 + 18) / 4 = 23 / 4 = 5.75\n     ```\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     -2, -3\n     18, -10\n     Average = (-2 - 3 + 18 - 10) / 4 = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n     ```\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     5, 4\n     2, 10\n     Average = (5 + 4 + 2 + 10) / 4 = 21 / 4 = 5.25\n     ```\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle)**:\n     ```\n     4, 18\n     10, -7\n     Average = (4 + 18 + 10 - 7) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\n     ```\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     18, -10\n     -7, 6\n     Average = (18 - 10 - 7 + 6) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75\n     ```\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix, corresponding to the positions of the windows:\n     ```\n     10.75, 4, 0.25\n     6, 5.75, 0.75\n     5.25, 6.25, 1.75\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n10.75, 4, 0.25\n6, 5.75, 0.75\n5.25, 6.25, 1.75\n```"
