Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n6, 9, -7, 10\n-8, 10, 16, -1\n7, 0, 1, 0\n16, -1, 17, 6\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     6, 9, -7, 10\n     -8, 10, 16, -1\n     7, 0, 1, 0\n     16, -1, 17, 6\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix with a 2x2 window, there will be (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 windows in each direction.\n\n3. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and slide the window across the matrix.\n   - For each position of the window, find the maximum value within the 2x2 window.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Window**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     6, 9\n     -8, 10\n     ```\n     Maximum = 10\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     ```\n     9, -7\n     10, 16\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     -7, 10\n     16, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     -8, 10\n     7, 0\n     ```\n     Maximum = 10\n\n   - **Window 5 (Center)**:\n     ```\n     10, 16\n     0, 1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     16, -1\n     1, 0\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     ```\n     7, 0\n     16, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle)**:\n     ```\n     0, 1\n     -1, 17\n     ```\n     Maximum = 17\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     1, 0\n     17, 6\n     ```\n     Maximum = 17\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in the order of their original window positions to form a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     10, 16, 16\n     10, 16, 16\n     16, 17, 17\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after max pooling, is:\n```\n10, 16, 16\n10, 16, 16\n16, 17, 17\n```"
