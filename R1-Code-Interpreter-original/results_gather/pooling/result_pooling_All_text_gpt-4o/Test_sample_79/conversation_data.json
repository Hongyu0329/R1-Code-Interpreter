    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, each producing one average value.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window:**\n   - For each 3x3 window, sum all the numbers within the window and divide by 9 (since there are 9 numbers in a 3x3 window).\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix:**\n   - Start from the top-left corner and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached, then move down one row and repeat.\n   - Calculate the average for each position of the window.\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - The new matrix will be 3x3, with each element being the average of the corresponding 3x3 window from the original matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window starting at (0,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & -6 & 8 \\\\\n  0 & 4 & 19 \\\\\n  4 & 1 & 19 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (20 + (-6) + 8 + 0 + 4 + 19 + 4 + 1 + 19) / 9 = 7.67\n\n- **Window starting at (0,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -6 & 8 & 6 \\\\\n  4 & 19 & 2 \\\\\n  1 & 19 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = ((-6) + 8 + 6 + 4 + 19 + 2 + 1 + 19 + 15) / 9 = 7.56\n\n- **Window starting at (0,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 6 & -5 \\\\\n  19 & 2 & 18 \\\\\n  19 & 15 & -3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (8 + 6 + (-5) + 19 + 2 + 18 + 19 + 15 + (-3)) / 9 = 8.77\n\n- **Window starting at (1,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 4 & 19 \\\\\n  4 & 1 & 19 \\\\\n  14 & 5 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (0 + 4 + 19 + 4 + 1 + 19 + 14 + 5 + 16) / 9 = 9.00\n\n- **Window starting at (1,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & 19 & 2 \\\\\n  1 & 19 & 15 \\\\\n  5 & 16 & 19 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (4 + 19 + 2 + 1 + 19 + 15 + 5 + 16 + 19) / 9 = 11.11\n\n- **Window starting at (1,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 2 & 18 \\\\\n  19 & 15 & -3 \\\\\n  16 & 19 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (19 + 2 + 18 + 19 + 15 + (-3) + 16 + 19 + (-6)) / 9 = 11.00\n\n- **Window starting at (2,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & 1 & 19 \\\\\n  14 & 5 & 16 \\\\\n  3 & 3 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (4 + 1 + 19 + 14 + 5 + 16 + 3 + 3 + (-1)) / 9 = 7.11\n\n- **Window starting at (2,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 19 & 15 \\\\\n  5 & 16 & 19 \\\\\n  3 & -1 & -7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (1 + 19 + 15 + 5 + 16 + 19 + 3 + (-1) + (-7)) / 9 = 7.78\n\n- **Window starting at (2,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 15 & -3 \\\\\n  16 & 19 & -6 \\\\\n  -1 & -7 & 20 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (19 + 15 + (-3) + 16 + 19 + (-6) + (-1) + (-7) + 20) / 9 = 8.00\n\n**Final 3x3 Matrix of Averages:**\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n7.67 & 7.56 & 8.77 \\\\\n9.00 & 11.11 & 11.00 \\\\\n7.11 & 7.78 & 8.00 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: \n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n7.67 & 7.56 & 8.77 \\\\\n9.00 & 11.11 & 11.00 \\\\\n7.11 & 7.78 & 8.00 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
