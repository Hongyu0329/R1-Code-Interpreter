    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     -5, 5, -5, 12\n     20, -4, 17, -7\n     -1, 7, -7, 19\n     -6, 5, 15, -1\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix with a 2x2 window, there will be (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 windows in each direction.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Sliding Window**:\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and calculate the average for each position.\n   - The window positions and their averages are as follows:\n\n   - **Position (0,0)**:\n     ```\n     -5, 5\n     20, -4\n     ```\n     Average = (-5 + 5 + 20 - 4) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4\n\n   - **Position (0,1)**:\n     ```\n     5, -5\n     -4, 17\n     ```\n     Average = (5 - 5 - 4 + 17) / 4 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\n   - **Position (0,2)**:\n     ```\n     -5, 12\n     17, -7\n     ```\n     Average = (-5 + 12 + 17 - 7) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25\n\n   - **Position (1,0)**:\n     ```\n     20, -4\n     -1, 7\n     ```\n     Average = (20 - 4 - 1 + 7) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5\n\n   - **Position (1,1)**:\n     ```\n     -4, 17\n     7, -7\n     ```\n     Average = (-4 + 17 + 7 - 7) / 4 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\n   - **Position (1,2)**:\n     ```\n     17, -7\n     -7, 19\n     ```\n     Average = (17 - 7 - 7 + 19) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5\n\n   - **Position (2,0)**:\n     ```\n     -1, 7\n     -6, 5\n     ```\n     Average = (-1 + 7 - 6 + 5) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25\n\n   - **Position (2,1)**:\n     ```\n     7, -7\n     5, 15\n     ```\n     Average = (7 - 7 + 5 + 15) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5\n\n   - **Position (2,2)**:\n     ```\n     -7, 19\n     15, -1\n     ```\n     Average = (-7 + 19 + 15 - 1) / 4 = 26 / 4 = 6.5\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix, corresponding to the positions of the sliding windows:\n     ```\n     4, 3.25, 4.25\n     5.5, 3.25, 5.5\n     1.25, 5, 6.5\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n4, 3.25, 4.25\n5.5, 3.25, 5.5\n1.25, 5, 6.5\n```"
