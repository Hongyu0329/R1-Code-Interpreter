    "To perform max pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to cover all possible 3x3 submatrices.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) for the first row, and similarly for the second and third rows.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, meaning there will be 9 windows in total.\n\n3. **Extract Each 3x3 Submatrix and Find the Maximum**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, extract the 3x3 submatrix and find the maximum value within that submatrix.\n\n4. **Arrange the Maximum Values**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a new 3x3 matrix according to the position of the top-left corner of each sliding window.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n- **Window starting at (0,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & -2 & 14 \\\\\n  11 & 11 & -1 \\\\\n  15 & 19 & 17 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 19\n\n- **Window starting at (0,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 14 & -1 \\\\\n  11 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n  19 & 17 & 3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 19\n\n- **Window starting at (0,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & -1 & 19 \\\\\n  -1 & 5 & -2 \\\\\n  17 & 3 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 19\n\n- **Window starting at (1,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 11 & -1 \\\\\n  15 & 19 & 17 \\\\\n  -8 & 9 & 19 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 19\n\n- **Window starting at (1,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n  19 & 17 & 3 \\\\\n  9 & 19 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 19\n\n- **Window starting at (1,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -1 & 5 & -2 \\\\\n  17 & 3 & -5 \\\\\n  19 & -6 & 10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 17\n\n- **Window starting at (2,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  15 & 19 & 17 \\\\\n  -8 & 9 & 19 \\\\\n  12 & 14 & 11 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 19\n\n- **Window starting at (2,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 17 & 3 \\\\\n  9 & 19 & -6 \\\\\n  14 & 11 & 18 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 19\n\n- **Window starting at (2,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & 3 & -5 \\\\\n  19 & -6 & 10 \\\\\n  11 & 18 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Maximum value: 19\n\n5. **Form the Resulting Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   19 & 19 & 19 \\\\\n   19 & 19 & 17 \\\\\n   19 & 19 & 19 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n19 & 19 & 19 \\\\\n19 & 19 & 17 \\\\\n19 & 19 & 19 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
