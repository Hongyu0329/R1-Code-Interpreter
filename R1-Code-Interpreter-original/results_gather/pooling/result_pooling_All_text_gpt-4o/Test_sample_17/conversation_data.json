We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n9, 3, -4\n-6, 4, 12\n-10, 12, -4\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 grid:\n     ```\n     9, 3, -4\n     -6, 4, 12\n     -10, 12, -4\n     ```\n   - We will use a 2x2 sliding window to perform max pooling. This means we will look at 2x2 submatrices within the 3x3 matrix and find the maximum value in each submatrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the original matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move in the following ways:\n     - Horizontally: It can start at column 1 or column 2.\n     - Vertically: It can start at row 1 or row 2.\n   - This results in a total of 4 possible positions for the sliding window.\n\n3. **Apply the Sliding Window and Find Maximums:**\n   - **Position 1 (Top-left corner):**\n     ```\n     9, 3\n     -6, 4\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 9\n\n   - **Position 2 (Top-right corner):**\n     ```\n     3, -4\n     4, 12\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 12\n\n   - **Position 3 (Bottom-left corner):**\n     ```\n     -6, 4\n     -10, 12\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 12\n\n   - **Position 4 (Bottom-right corner):**\n     ```\n     4, 12\n     12, -4\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 12\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - The new matrix formed by the maximum values from each sliding window is a 2x2 matrix:\n     ```\n     9, 12\n     12, 12\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The final result of the max pooling operation is the 2x2 matrix:\n     ```\n     9, 12\n     12, 12\n     ```\n\nAnswer:\n```\n9, 12\n12, 12\n```"
