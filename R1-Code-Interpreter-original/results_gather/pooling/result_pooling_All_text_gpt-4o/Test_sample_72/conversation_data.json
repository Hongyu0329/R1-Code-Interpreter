    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - Horizontally, the window can start at columns 1, 2, and 3 (0-indexed).\n   - Vertically, the window can start at rows 1, 2, and 3 (0-indexed).\n   - This results in a total of 3x3 = 9 possible windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Arrange the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages will form a new 3x3 matrix, as there are 3 possible starting positions both horizontally and vertically.\n\n5. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - For each starting position (i, j) of the window, calculate the average of the numbers in the window.\n\nLet's perform the calculations for each window:\n\n- **Window starting at (0,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{2, -2, 10, 1, 3, 9, 20, 20, 6\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{2 + (-2) + 10 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 20 + 20 + 6}{9} = \\frac{69}{9} = 7.67\n  \\]\n\n- **Window starting at (0,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{-2, 10, 3, 3, 9, 15, 20, 6, 13\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{-2 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 9 + 15 + 20 + 6 + 13}{9} = \\frac{77}{9} = 8.56\n  \\]\n\n- **Window starting at (0,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{10, 3, 3, 9, 15, 16, 6, 13, 15\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{10 + 3 + 3 + 9 + 15 + 16 + 6 + 13 + 15}{9} = \\frac{90}{9} = 10.00\n  \\]\n\n- **Window starting at (1,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{1, 3, 9, 20, 20, 6, 5, -3, 19\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{1 + 3 + 9 + 20 + 20 + 6 + 5 + (-3) + 19}{9} = \\frac{80}{9} = 8.89\n  \\]\n\n- **Window starting at (1,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{3, 9, 15, 20, 6, 13, -3, 19, -1\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{3 + 9 + 15 + 20 + 6 + 13 + (-3) + 19 + (-1)}{9} = \\frac{81}{9} = 9.00\n  \\]\n\n- **Window starting at (1,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{9, 15, 16, 6, 13, 15, 19, -1, 14\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{9 + 15 + 16 + 6 + 13 + 15 + 19 + (-1) + 14}{9} = \\frac{106}{9} = 11.78\n  \\]\n\n- **Window starting at (2,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{20, 20, 6, 5, -3, 19, 7, 19, 4\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{20 + 20 + 6 + 5 + (-3) + 19 + 7 + 19 + 4}{9} = \\frac{97}{9} = 10.78\n  \\]\n\n- **Window starting at (2,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{20, 6, 13, -3, 19, -1, 19, 4, 1\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{20 + 6 + 13 + (-3) + 19 + (-1) + 19 + 4 + 1}{9} = \\frac{78}{9} = 8.67\n  \\]\n\n- **Window starting at (2,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numbers: } \\{6, 13, 15, 19, -1, 14, 4, 1, 16\\}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average: } \\frac{6 + 13 + 15 + 19 + (-1) + 14 + 4 + 1 + 16}{9} = \\frac{87}{9} = 9.67\n  \\]\n\n6. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages into a 3x3 matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n7.67 & 8.56 & 10.00 \\\\\n8.89 & 9.00 & 11.78 \\\\\n10.78 & 8.67 & 9.67 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n7.67 & 8.56 & 10.00 \\\\\n8.89 & 9.00 & 11.78 \\\\\n10.78 & 8.67 & 9.67 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
