    "To perform max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     -5, -10, 1\n     1, 14, -10\n     15, 19, 20\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the original matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix to form a new 2x2 matrix.\n   - The sliding window can move horizontally and vertically, but it must stay within the bounds of the original matrix.\n   - The possible top-left corners of the sliding window are:\n     - (0,0), (0,1)\n     - (1,0), (1,1)\n\n3. **Apply the Sliding Window and Find Maximum Values:**\n   - For each position of the sliding window, find the maximum value within that window.\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     -5, -10\n     1, 14\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 14\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     -10, 1\n     14, -10\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 14\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     1, 14\n     15, 19\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     ```\n     14, -10\n     19, 20\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values found from each sliding window in the order of their top-left corner positions to form the new matrix:\n     ```\n     14, 14\n     19, 20\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The resulting matrix after max pooling is:\n     ```\n     14, 14\n     19, 20\n     ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n14, 14\n19, 20\n```"
