    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - Horizontally, the window can start at columns 1, 2, and 3 (0-indexed).\n   - Vertically, the window can start at rows 1, 2, and 3 (0-indexed).\n   - This results in a total of 3x3 = 9 possible windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Arrange the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages will form a new 3x3 matrix, as there are 3 possible starting positions both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's calculate the averages for each window:\n\n- **Window starting at (0,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & -2 & -1 \\\\\n  9 & 6 & 12 \\\\\n  11 & 14 & 18 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -5 + (-2) + (-1) + 9 + 6 + 12 + 11 + 14 + 18 = 62\n  Average = 62 / 9 ≈ 6.89\n\n- **Window starting at (0,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & -1 & 9 \\\\\n  6 & 12 & 16 \\\\\n  14 & 18 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -2 + (-1) + 9 + 6 + 12 + 16 + 14 + 18 + 0 = 72\n  Average = 72 / 9 = 8\n\n- **Window starting at (0,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -1 & 9 & 11 \\\\\n  12 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n  18 & 0 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -1 + 9 + 11 + 12 + 16 + 16 + 18 + 0 + 16 = 97\n  Average = 97 / 9 ≈ 10.78\n\n- **Window starting at (1,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & 6 & 12 \\\\\n  11 & 14 & 18 \\\\\n  20 & 14 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 9 + 6 + 12 + 11 + 14 + 18 + 20 + 14 + 15 = 119\n  Average = 119 / 9 ≈ 13.22\n\n- **Window starting at (1,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  6 & 12 & 16 \\\\\n  14 & 18 & 0 \\\\\n  14 & 15 & -7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 6 + 12 + 16 + 14 + 18 + 0 + 14 + 15 + (-7) = 88\n  Average = 88 / 9 ≈ 9.78\n\n- **Window starting at (1,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n  18 & 0 & 16 \\\\\n  15 & -7 & 3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 12 + 16 + 16 + 18 + 0 + 16 + 15 + (-7) + 3 = 89\n  Average = 89 / 9 ≈ 9.89\n\n- **Window starting at (2,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 14 & 18 \\\\\n  20 & 14 & 15 \\\\\n  5 & 6 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 11 + 14 + 18 + 20 + 14 + 15 + 5 + 6 + (-1) = 102\n  Average = 102 / 9 ≈ 11.33\n\n- **Window starting at (2,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & 18 & 0 \\\\\n  14 & 15 & -7 \\\\\n  6 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 14 + 18 + 0 + 14 + 15 + (-7) + 6 + (-1) + 1 = 60\n  Average = 60 / 9 ≈ 6.67\n\n- **Window starting at (2,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  18 & 0 & 16 \\\\\n  15 & -7 & 3 \\\\\n  -1 & 1 & 7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 18 + 0 + 16 + 15 + (-7) + 3 + (-1) + 1 + 7 = 52\n  Average = 52 / 9 ≈ 5.78\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix formed by the averages is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   6.89 & 8 & 10.78 \\\\\n   13.22 & 9.78 & 9.89 \\\\\n   11.33 & 6.67 & 5.78 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6.89 & 8 & 10.78 \\\\\n13.22 & 9.78 & 9.89 \\\\\n11.33 & 6.67 & 5.78 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
