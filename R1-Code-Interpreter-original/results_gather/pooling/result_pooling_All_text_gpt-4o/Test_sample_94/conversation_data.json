    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages from each window will form a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & -10 & 19 \\\\\n  12 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n  6 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((17 + (-10) + 19 + 12 + 1 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 3) / 9 = 60 / 9 = 6.67\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10 & 19 & 2 \\\\\n  1 & 9 & 19 \\\\\n  3 & 3 & 12 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(((-10) + 19 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 19 + 3 + 3 + 12) / 9 = 58 / 9 = 6.44\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 2 & -8 \\\\\n  9 & 19 & 2 \\\\\n  3 & 12 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((19 + 2 + (-8) + 9 + 19 + 2 + 3 + 12 + 15) / 9 = 73 / 9 = 8.11\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & -8 & 11 \\\\\n  19 & 2 & 11 \\\\\n  12 & 15 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((2 + (-8) + 11 + 19 + 2 + 11 + 12 + 15 + 15) / 9 = 79 / 9 = 8.78\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n  6 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n  -9 & 2 & 14 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((12 + 1 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 3 + (-9) + 2 + 14) / 9 = 41 / 9 = 4.56\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 9 & 19 \\\\\n  3 & 3 & 12 \\\\\n  2 & 14 & 19 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((1 + 9 + 19 + 3 + 3 + 12 + 2 + 14 + 19) / 9 = 82 / 9 = 9.11\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & 19 & 2 \\\\\n  3 & 12 & 15 \\\\\n  14 & 19 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((9 + 19 + 2 + 3 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 19 + 6) / 9 = 99 / 9 = 11.00\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 2 & 11 \\\\\n  12 & 15 & 15 \\\\\n  19 & 6 & -7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((19 + 2 + 11 + 12 + 15 + 15 + 19 + 6 + (-7)) / 9 = 92 / 9 = 10.22\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  6 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n  -9 & 2 & 14 \\\\\n  14 & 7 & 2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((6 + 3 + 3 + (-9) + 2 + 14 + 14 + 7 + 2) / 9 = 42 / 9 = 4.67\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 3 & 12 \\\\\n  2 & 14 & 19 \\\\\n  7 & 2 & 14 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((3 + 3 + 12 + 2 + 14 + 19 + 7 + 2 + 14) / 9 = 76 / 9 = 8.44\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 12 & 15 \\\\\n  14 & 19 & 6 \\\\\n  2 & 14 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((3 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 19 + 6 + 2 + 14 + 5) / 9 = 90 / 9 = 10.00\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & 15 & 15 \\\\\n  19 & 6 & -7 \\\\\n  14 & 5 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((12 + 15 + 15 + 19 + 6 + (-7) + 14 + 5 + 4) / 9 = 83 / 9 = 9.22\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -9 & 2 & 14 \\\\\n  14 & 7 & 2 \\\\\n  19 & -9 & 13 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(((-9) + 2 + 14 + 14 + 7 + 2 + 19 + (-9) + 13) / 9 = 53 / 9 = 5.89\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 14 & 19 \\\\\n  7 & 2 & 14 \\\\\n  -9 & 13 & 14 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((2 + 14 + 19 + 7 + 2 + 14 + (-9) + 13 + 14) / 9 = 76 / 9 = 8.44\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & 19 & 6 \\\\\n  2 & 14 & 5 \\\\\n  13 & 14 & 14 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((14 + 19 + 6 + 2 + 14 + 5 + 13 + 14 + 14) / 9 = 101 / 9 = 11"
