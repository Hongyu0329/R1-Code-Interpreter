    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting matrix will be 4x4, as there are 4 possible positions horizontally and 4 vertically.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & -10 & -3 \\\\\n  9 & 12 & -10 \\\\\n  16 & 7 & 20\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((3 + (-10) + (-3) + 9 + 12 + (-10) + 16 + 7 + 20) / 9 = 4.89\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10 & -3 & -1 \\\\\n  12 & -10 & 13 \\\\\n  7 & 20 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-10 + (-3) + (-1) + 12 + (-10) + 13 + 7 + 20 + 1) / 9 = 3.22\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -3 & -1 & -10 \\\\\n  -10 & 13 & -2 \\\\\n  20 & 1 & 6\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-3 + (-1) + (-10) + (-10) + 13 + (-2) + 20 + 1 + 6) / 9 = 1.56\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -1 & -10 & 8 \\\\\n  13 & -2 & 4 \\\\\n  1 & 6 & 7\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-1 + (-10) + 8 + 13 + (-2) + 4 + 1 + 6 + 7) / 9 = 2.89\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & 12 & -10 \\\\\n  16 & 7 & 20 \\\\\n  6 & 11 & 11\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((9 + 12 + (-10) + 16 + 7 + 20 + 6 + 11 + 11) / 9 = 9.11\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & -10 & 13 \\\\\n  7 & 20 & 1 \\\\\n  11 & 11 & 3\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((12 + (-10) + 13 + 7 + 20 + 1 + 11 + 11 + 3) / 9 = 7.56\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10 & 13 & -2 \\\\\n  20 & 1 & 6 \\\\\n  11 & 3 & 19\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-10 + 13 + (-2) + 20 + 1 + 6 + 11 + 3 + 19) / 9 = 6.78\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  13 & -2 & 4 \\\\\n  1 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n  3 & 19 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((13 + (-2) + 4 + 1 + 6 + 7 + 3 + 19 + 1) / 9 = 5.78\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  16 & 7 & 20 \\\\\n  6 & 11 & 11 \\\\\n  -2 & 1 & 11\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((16 + 7 + 20 + 6 + 11 + 11 + (-2) + 1 + 11) / 9 = 9.00\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  7 & 20 & 1 \\\\\n  11 & 11 & 3 \\\\\n  1 & 11 & -4\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((7 + 20 + 1 + 11 + 11 + 3 + 1 + 11 + (-4)) / 9 = 6.78\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & 1 & 6 \\\\\n  11 & 3 & 19 \\\\\n  11 & -4 & 8\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((20 + 1 + 6 + 11 + 3 + 19 + 11 + (-4) + 8) / 9 = 8.33\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n  3 & 19 & 1 \\\\\n  -4 & 8 & -4\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((1 + 6 + 7 + 3 + 19 + 1 + (-4) + 8 + (-4)) / 9 = 4.11\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  6 & 11 & 11 \\\\\n  -2 & 1 & 11 \\\\\n  20 & -1 & -1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((6 + 11 + 11 + (-2) + 1 + 11 + 20 + (-1) + (-1)) / 9 = 6.22\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 11 & 3 \\\\\n  1 & 11 & -4 \\\\\n  -1 & -1 & -10\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((11 + 11 + 3 + 1 + 11 + (-4) + (-1) + (-1) + (-10)) / 9 = 2.33\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 3 & 19 \\\\\n  11 & -4 & 8 \\\\\n  -1 & -10 & -7\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((11 + 3 + 19 + 11 + (-4) + 8 + (-1) + (-10) + (-7)) / 9 = 3.33\\)\n\n- **Window 16 (Slide right)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 19 & 1 \\\\\n  -4 & 8 & -4 \\\\\n  -10 & -7 & 12\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((3 + 19 + 1 + (-4) + "
