    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     3, 13, 4, 14\n     17, -9, -5, 10\n     8, 0, 7, 13\n     13, -6, 1, 8\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix to form a new 3x3 matrix of averages. This is because:\n     - Horizontally, the window can start at columns 0, 1, and 2.\n     - Vertically, the window can start at rows 0, 1, and 2.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n\n4. **Perform Calculations**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     3, 13\n     17, -9\n     Average = (3 + 13 + 17 - 9) / 4 = 6\n     ```\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     13, 4\n     -9, -5\n     Average = (13 + 4 - 9 - 5) / 4 = 0.75\n     ```\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     ```\n     4, 14\n     -5, 10\n     Average = (4 + 14 - 5 + 10) / 4 = 5.75\n     ```\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     17, -9\n     8, 0\n     Average = (17 - 9 + 8 + 0) / 4 = 4\n     ```\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     ```\n     -9, -5\n     0, 7\n     Average = (-9 - 5 + 0 + 7) / 4 = -1.75\n     ```\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     ```\n     -5, 10\n     7, 13\n     Average = (-5 + 10 + 7 + 13) / 4 = 6.25\n     ```\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     ```\n     8, 0\n     13, -6\n     Average = (8 + 0 + 13 - 6) / 4 = 3.75\n     ```\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     ```\n     0, 7\n     -6, 1\n     Average = (0 + 7 - 6 + 1) / 4 = 0.5\n     ```\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     ```\n     7, 13\n     1, 8\n     Average = (7 + 13 + 1 + 8) / 4 = 7.25\n     ```\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages into a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     6, 0.75, 5.75\n     4, -1.75, 6.25\n     3.75, 0.5, 7.25\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n6, 0.75, 5.75\n4, -1.75, 6.25\n3.75, 0.5, 7.25\n```"
