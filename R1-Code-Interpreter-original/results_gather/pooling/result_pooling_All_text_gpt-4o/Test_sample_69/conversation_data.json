    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages from each window form a new 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window starting at (0,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  8 & 11 & 19 \\\\\n  7 & 11 & 15 \\\\\n  11 & 7 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (8 + 11 + 19 + 7 + 11 + 15 + 11 + 7 + 4) / 9 = 10.33\n\n- **Window starting at (0,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 19 & 19 \\\\\n  11 & 15 & 8 \\\\\n  7 & 4 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (11 + 19 + 19 + 11 + 15 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 15) / 9 = 12.11\n\n- **Window starting at (0,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 19 & 0 \\\\\n  15 & 8 & 10 \\\\\n  4 & 15 & 7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (19 + 19 + 0 + 15 + 8 + 10 + 4 + 15 + 7) / 9 = 10.78\n\n- **Window starting at (1,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  7 & 11 & 15 \\\\\n  11 & 7 & 4 \\\\\n  4 & -6 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (7 + 11 + 15 + 11 + 7 + 4 + 4 - 6 - 9) / 9 = 4.89\n\n- **Window starting at (1,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 15 & 8 \\\\\n  7 & 4 & 15 \\\\\n  -6 & -9 & 10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (11 + 15 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 15 - 6 - 9 + 10) / 9 = 6.11\n\n- **Window starting at (1,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  15 & 8 & 10 \\\\\n  4 & 15 & 7 \\\\\n  -9 & 10 & 12 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (15 + 8 + 10 + 4 + 15 + 7 - 9 + 10 + 12) / 9 = 7.89\n\n- **Window starting at (2,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 7 & 4 \\\\\n  4 & -6 & -9 \\\\\n  -3 & 15 & 20 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (11 + 7 + 4 + 4 - 6 - 9 - 3 + 15 + 20) / 9 = 4.78\n\n- **Window starting at (2,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  7 & 4 & 15 \\\\\n  -6 & -9 & 10 \\\\\n  15 & 20 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (7 + 4 + 15 - 6 - 9 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 9) / 9 = 7.22\n\n- **Window starting at (2,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & 15 & 7 \\\\\n  -9 & 10 & 12 \\\\\n  20 & 9 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (4 + 15 + 7 - 9 + 10 + 12 + 20 + 9 + 15) / 9 = 9.22\n\n6. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix formed by the averages is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   10.33 & 12.11 & 10.78 \\\\\n   4.89 & 6.11 & 7.89 \\\\\n   4.78 & 7.22 & 9.22 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n10.33 & 12.11 & 10.78 \\\\\n4.89 & 6.11 & 7.89 \\\\\n4.78 & 7.22 & 9.22 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
