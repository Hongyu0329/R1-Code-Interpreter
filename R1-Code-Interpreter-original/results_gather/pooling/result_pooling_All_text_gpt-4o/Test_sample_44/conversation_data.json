    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is a 5x5 grid:\n     ```\n     20, 9, 7, 20, 7\n     3, 19, -4, 9, 16\n     7, 9, 7, -1, 10\n     -6, 16, -1, -1, -3\n     1, 7, -1, 12, 18\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover a 3x3 section of the matrix at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide:\n     - Horizontally: 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 positions\n     - Vertically: 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 positions\n   - This results in a total of 3x3 = 9 sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the new matrix.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Window**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     20, 9, 7\n     3, 19, -4\n     7, 9, 7\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center)**:\n     ```\n     9, 7, 20\n     19, -4, 9\n     9, 7, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     7, 20, 7\n     -4, 9, 16\n     7, -1, 10\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     3, 19, -4\n     7, 9, 7\n     -6, 16, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n     ```\n     19, -4, 9\n     9, 7, -1\n     16, -1, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 19\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     -4, 9, 16\n     7, -1, 10\n     -1, -1, -3\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     ```\n     7, 9, 7\n     -6, 16, -1\n     1, 7, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n     ```\n     9, 7, -1\n     16, -1, -1\n     7, -1, 12\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right)**:\n     ```\n     7, -1, 10\n     -1, -1, -3\n     -1, 12, 18\n     ```\n     Maximum = 18\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     20, 20, 20\n     19, 19, 16\n     16, 16, 18\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling with a 3x3 sliding window, is:\n```\n20, 20, 20\n19, 19, 16\n16, 16, 18\n```"
