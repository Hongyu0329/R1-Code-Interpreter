    "To perform max pooling on the given 4x4 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     6, -6, -9, -8\n     2, 7, 4, 16\n     5, 19, -6, 11\n     20, 14, -8, 4\n     ```\n   - We will use a 2x2 sliding window to find the maximum value in each window.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the sliding window is 2x2, the sliding window can move in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is (4 - 2 + 1) = 3.\n   - Therefore, we will have a 3x3 matrix of maximum values after applying the sliding window.\n\n3. **Apply the Sliding Window:**\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each window.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum Values for Each Window:**\n   - **First Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 1 (top-left): \n       ```\n       6, -6\n       2, 7\n       ```\n       Max = 7\n     - Window 2 (top-middle):\n       ```\n       -6, -9\n       7, 4\n       ```\n       Max = 7\n     - Window 3 (top-right):\n       ```\n       -9, -8\n       4, 16\n       ```\n       Max = 16\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 4 (middle-left):\n       ```\n       2, 7\n       5, 19\n       ```\n       Max = 19\n     - Window 5 (middle-middle):\n       ```\n       7, 4\n       19, -6\n       ```\n       Max = 19\n     - Window 6 (middle-right):\n       ```\n       4, 16\n       -6, 11\n       ```\n       Max = 16\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows:**\n     - Window 7 (bottom-left):\n       ```\n       5, 19\n       20, 14\n       ```\n       Max = 20\n     - Window 8 (bottom-middle):\n       ```\n       19, -6\n       14, -8\n       ```\n       Max = 19\n     - Window 9 (bottom-right):\n       ```\n       -6, 11\n       -8, 4\n       ```\n       Max = 11\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix according to their original positions:\n     ```\n     7, 7, 16\n     19, 19, 16\n     20, 19, 11\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the matrix after max pooling, is:\n```\n7, 7, 16\n19, 19, 16\n20, 19, 11\n```"
