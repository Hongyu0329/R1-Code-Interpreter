We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n10, 18, 10\n19, -6, -10\n1, -9, 18\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 grid:\n     ```\n     10, 18, 10\n     19, -6, -10\n     1, -9, 18\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 3x3 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of possible positions for the top-left corner of the 2x2 window is determined by the difference in dimensions: (3-2+1) x (3-2+1) = 2 x 2 = 4 positions.\n\n3. **Slide the Window and Find Maximum Values:**\n   - **Position 1 (Top-left corner at (0,0)):**\n     ```\n     10, 18\n     19, -6\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Position 2 (Top-left corner at (0,1)):**\n     ```\n     18, 10\n     -6, -10\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 18\n\n   - **Position 3 (Top-left corner at (1,0)):**\n     ```\n     19, -6\n     1, -9\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Position 4 (Top-left corner at (1,1)):**\n     ```\n     -6, -10\n     -9, 18\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 18\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values found in each sliding window according to their original positions:\n     ```\n     19, 18\n     19, 18\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The resulting matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n     ```\n     19, 18\n     19, 18\n     ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n19, 18\n19, 18"
