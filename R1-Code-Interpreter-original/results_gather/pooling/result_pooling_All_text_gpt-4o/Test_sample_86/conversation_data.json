    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the sum of the 9 elements and then divide by 9 to get the average.\n   - Slide the window from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n4. **Arrange the Averages into a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages will form a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's calculate the averages for each window:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -6 & 19 & 11 \\\\\n  6 & -9 & 10 \\\\\n  15 & -7 & 17 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -6 + 19 + 11 + 6 - 9 + 10 + 15 - 7 + 17 = 56\n  Average = 56 / 9 = 6.22 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n- **Window 2 (Top row, second position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  19 & 11 & 5 \\\\\n  -9 & 10 & 9 \\\\\n  -7 & 17 & 18 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 19 + 11 + 5 - 9 + 10 + 9 - 7 + 17 + 18 = 73\n  Average = 73 / 9 = 8.11\n\n- **Window 3 (Top row, third position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & 5 & -6 \\\\\n  10 & 9 & 0 \\\\\n  17 & 18 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 11 + 5 - 6 + 10 + 9 + 0 + 17 + 18 + 0 = 64\n  Average = 64 / 9 = 7.11\n\n- **Window 4 (Top row, fourth position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & -6 & 20 \\\\\n  9 & 0 & 7 \\\\\n  18 & 0 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 5 - 6 + 20 + 9 + 0 + 7 + 18 + 0 + 16 = 69\n  Average = 69 / 9 = 7.67\n\n- **Window 5 (Second row, first position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  6 & -9 & 10 \\\\\n  15 & -7 & 17 \\\\\n  2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 6 - 9 + 10 + 15 - 7 + 17 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 35\n  Average = 35 / 9 = 3.89\n\n- **Window 6 (Second row, second position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -9 & 10 & 9 \\\\\n  -7 & 17 & 18 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -9 + 10 + 9 - 7 + 17 + 18 + 1 + 0 + 6 = 45\n  Average = 45 / 9 = 5.00\n\n- **Window 7 (Second row, third position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 9 & 0 \\\\\n  17 & 18 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 10 + 9 + 0 + 17 + 18 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 6 = 66\n  Average = 66 / 9 = 7.33\n\n- **Window 8 (Second row, fourth position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & 0 & 7 \\\\\n  18 & 0 & 16 \\\\\n  6 & 6 & 10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 9 + 0 + 7 + 18 + 0 + 16 + 6 + 6 + 10 = 72\n  Average = 72 / 9 = 8.00\n\n- **Window 9 (Third row, first position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  15 & -7 & 17 \\\\\n  2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  15 & -10 & 20 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 15 - 7 + 17 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 15 - 10 + 20 = 53\n  Average = 53 / 9 = 5.89\n\n- **Window 10 (Third row, second position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -7 & 17 & 18 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 6 \\\\\n  -10 & 20 & -4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = -7 + 17 + 18 + 1 + 0 + 6 - 10 + 20 - 4 = 41\n  Average = 41 / 9 = 4.56\n\n- **Window 11 (Third row, third position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & 18 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n  20 & -4 & -8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 17 + 18 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 6 + 20 - 4 - 8 = 55\n  Average = 55 / 9 = 6.11\n\n- **Window 12 (Third row, fourth position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  18 & 0 & 16 \\\\\n  6 & 6 & 10 \\\\\n  -4 & -8 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 18 + 0 + 16 + 6 + 6 + 10 - 4 - 8 + 16 = 60\n  Average = 60 / 9 = 6.67\n\n- **Window 13 (Fourth row, first position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  15 & -10 & 20 \\\\\n  3 & 11 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 2 + 1 + 0 + 15 - 10 + 20 + 3 + 11 - 5 = 37\n  Average = 37 / 9 = 4.11\n\n- **Window 14 (Fourth row, second position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 0 & 6 \\\\\n  -10 & 20 & -4 \\\\\n  11 & -5 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 1 + 0 + 6 - 10 + 20 - 4 + 11 - 5 + 6 = 25\n  Average = 25 / 9 = 2.78\n\n- **Window 15 (Fourth row, third position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n  20 & -4 & -8 \\\\\n  -5 & 6 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Sum = 0 + 6 + 6 + 20 - 4 - 8 - 5 + 6 + 16 = 37\n  Average = 37 / 9 = 4.11\n\n- **Window 16 (Fourth row, fourth position)**:\n  \\[\n  \\"
