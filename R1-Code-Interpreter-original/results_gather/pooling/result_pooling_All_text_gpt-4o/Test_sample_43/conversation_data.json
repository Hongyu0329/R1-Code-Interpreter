  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window.

    "To perform max pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to cover all possible 3x3 submatrices.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) possible windows.\n\n3. **Slide the Window and Find Maximum Values**:\n   - For each position of the 3x3 window, find the maximum value within that window.\n   - The windows and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -7 & 19 & -9 \\\\\n     6 & 11 & 4 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 6 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 19\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     19 & -9 & -8 \\\\\n     11 & 4 & -6 \\\\\n     1 & 6 & 16 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 19\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -9 & -8 & 6 \\\\\n     4 & -6 & -10 \\\\\n     6 & 16 & -9 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 16\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     6 & 11 & 4 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 6 \\\\\n     -10 & 13 & 14 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 14\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     11 & 4 & -6 \\\\\n     1 & 6 & 16 \\\\\n     13 & 14 & -8 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 16\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     4 & -6 & -10 \\\\\n     6 & 16 & -9 \\\\\n     14 & -8 & -1 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 16\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 1 & 6 \\\\\n     -10 & 13 & 14 \\\\\n     12 & 18 & 10 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 18\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 6 & 16 \\\\\n     13 & 14 & -8 \\\\\n     18 & 10 & 20 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 20\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     6 & 16 & -9 \\\\\n     14 & -8 & -1 \\\\\n     10 & 20 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value: 20\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix according to the positions of the windows:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   19 & 19 & 16 \\\\\n   14 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n   18 & 20 & 20 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling, is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n19 & 19 & 16 \\\\\n14 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n18 & 20 & 20 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
