    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     11, 4, -7, -9\n     3, -10, 2, 9\n     -7, 5, -8, 13\n     17, 1, 5, -9\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is determined by subtracting the window size from the matrix size and adding 1.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix and a 2x2 window, there will be (4-2+1) = 3 windows horizontally and 3 windows vertically.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and calculate the average for each position.\n   - The windows and their averages are as follows:\n\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     11, 4\n     3, -10\n     ```\n     Average = (11 + 4 + 3 - 10) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 0.5\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     ```\n     4, -7\n     -10, 2\n     ```\n     Average = (4 - 7 - 10 + 2) / 4 = -11 / 4 = -2.75\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     -7, -9\n     2, 9\n     ```\n     Average = (-7 - 9 + 2 + 9) / 4 = -5 / 4 = -1.25\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     3, -10\n     -7, 5\n     ```\n     Average = (3 - 10 - 7 + 5) / 4 = -9 / 4 = -2.25\n\n   - **Window 5 (Center)**:\n     ```\n     -10, 2\n     5, -8\n     ```\n     Average = (-10 + 2 + 5 - 8) / 4 = -11 / 4 = -2.75\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     2, 9\n     -8, 13\n     ```\n     Average = (2 + 9 - 8 + 13) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     -7, 5\n     17, 1\n     ```\n     Average = (-7 + 5 + 17 + 1) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle)**:\n     ```\n     5, -8\n     1, 5\n     ```\n     Average = (5 - 8 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     -8, 13\n     5, -9\n     ```\n     Average = (-8 + 13 + 5 - 9) / 4 = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix, corresponding to the positions of the windows:\n     ```\n     0.5, -2.75, -1.25\n     -2.25, -2.75, 4\n     4, 0.75, 0.25\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n0.5, -2.75, -1.25\n-2.25, -2.75, 4\n4, 0.75, 0.25\n```"
