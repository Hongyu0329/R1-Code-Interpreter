    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     8, 10, -6, -7\n     0, 10, 2, 19\n     4, 3, -5, -10\n     2, 2, -1, -9\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of windows vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - **First Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 1 (top-left): \n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       8 & 10 \\\\\n       0 & 10\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((8 + 10 + 0 + 10) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7\\).\n\n     - Window 2 (top-middle):\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       10 & -6 \\\\\n       10 & 2\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((10 - 6 + 10 + 2) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4\\).\n\n     - Window 3 (top-right):\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       -6 & -7 \\\\\n       2 & 19\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((-6 - 7 + 2 + 19) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2\\).\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 4 (middle-left):\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       0 & 10 \\\\\n       4 & 3\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((0 + 10 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25\\).\n\n     - Window 5 (middle-middle):\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       10 & 2 \\\\\n       3 & -5\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((10 + 2 + 3 - 5) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\\).\n\n     - Window 6 (middle-right):\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       2 & 19 \\\\\n       -5 & -10\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((2 + 19 - 5 - 10) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5\\).\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 7 (bottom-left):\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       4 & 3 \\\\\n       2 & 2\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((4 + 3 + 2 + 2) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75\\).\n\n     - Window 8 (bottom-middle):\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       3 & -5 \\\\\n       2 & -1\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((3 - 5 + 2 - 1) / 4 = -1 / 4 = -0.25\\).\n\n     - Window 9 (bottom-right):\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       -5 & -10 \\\\\n       -1 & -9\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n       Average = \\((-5 - 10 - 1 - 9) / 4 = -25 / 4 = -6.25\\).\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     7, 4, 2\n     4.25, 2.5, 1.5\n     2.75, -0.25, -6.25\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<7, 4, 2>, <4.25, 2.5, 1.5>, <2.75, -0.25, -6.25>>>\n```"
