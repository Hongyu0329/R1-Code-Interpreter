    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 grid:\n     ```\n     7, -9, 2\n     -5, 11, -3\n     8, 7, 18\n     ```\n   - We will use a 2x2 sliding window to perform max pooling. This means we will look at 2x2 submatrices within the 3x3 matrix and find the maximum value in each submatrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The top-left corner of the sliding window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Sliding Window:**\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     7, -9\n     -5, 11\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 11\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     -9, 2\n     11, -3\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 11\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     -5, 11\n     8, 7\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 11\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     ```\n     11, -3\n     7, 18\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 18\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - The new matrix is formed by arranging the maximum values from each sliding window in the order they were calculated:\n     ```\n     11, 11\n     11, 18\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The resulting matrix after max pooling is:\n     ```\n     11, 11\n     11, 18\n     ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n11, 11\n11, 18\n```"
