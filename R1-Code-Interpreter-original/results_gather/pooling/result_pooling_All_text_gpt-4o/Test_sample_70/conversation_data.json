    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - Horizontally, the window can start at columns 1, 2, and 3 (0-indexed).\n   - Vertically, the window can start at rows 1, 2, and 3 (0-indexed).\n   - This results in a total of 3x3 = 9 possible windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window across the matrix.\n   - For each position, calculate the average and store it in a new matrix.\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix will be a 3x3 matrix, as there are 3 possible starting positions for the window both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window starting at (0,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & -5 & 20 \\\\\n  5 & 18 & 7 \\\\\n  17 & -2 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (10 + (-5) + 20 + 5 + 18 + 7 + 17 + (-2) + 1) / 9 = 8.12\n\n- **Window starting at (0,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & 20 & 11 \\\\\n  18 & 7 & 1 \\\\\n  -2 & 1 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = ((-5) + 20 + 11 + 18 + 7 + 1 + (-2) + 1 + (-2)) / 9 = 5.44\n\n- **Window starting at (0,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & 11 & 6 \\\\\n  7 & 1 & 16 \\\\\n  1 & -2 & 11 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (20 + 11 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 16 + 1 + (-2) + 11) / 9 = 7.89\n\n- **Window starting at (1,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 18 & 7 \\\\\n  17 & -2 & 1 \\\\\n  7 & 17 & 14 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (5 + 18 + 7 + 17 + (-2) + 1 + 7 + 17 + 14) / 9 = 9.33\n\n- **Window starting at (1,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  18 & 7 & 1 \\\\\n  -2 & 1 & -2 \\\\\n  17 & 14 & 17 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (18 + 7 + 1 + (-2) + 1 + (-2) + 17 + 14 + 17) / 9 = 7.89\n\n- **Window starting at (1,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  7 & 1 & 16 \\\\\n  1 & -2 & 11 \\\\\n  14 & 17 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (7 + 1 + 16 + 1 + (-2) + 11 + 14 + 17 + 9) / 9 = 8.22\n\n- **Window starting at (2,0):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & -2 & 1 \\\\\n  7 & 17 & 14 \\\\\n  17 & 15 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (17 + (-2) + 1 + 7 + 17 + 14 + 17 + 15 + 4) / 9 = 10.00\n\n- **Window starting at (2,1):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 1 & -2 \\\\\n  17 & 14 & 17 \\\\\n  15 & 4 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = ((-2) + 1 + (-2) + 17 + 14 + 17 + 15 + 4 + (-1)) / 9 = 7.00\n\n- **Window starting at (2,2):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & -2 & 11 \\\\\n  14 & 17 & 9 \\\\\n  4 & -1 & -8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (1 + (-2) + 11 + 14 + 17 + 9 + 4 + (-1) + (-8)) / 9 = 5.00\n\n6. **Output the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix formed by the averages is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   8.12 & 5.44 & 7.89 \\\\\n   9.33 & 7.89 & 8.22 \\\\\n   10.00 & 7.00 & 5.00 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n8.12 & 5.44 & 7.89 \\\\\n9.33 & 7.89 & 8.22 \\\\\n10.00 & 7.00 & 5.00 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
