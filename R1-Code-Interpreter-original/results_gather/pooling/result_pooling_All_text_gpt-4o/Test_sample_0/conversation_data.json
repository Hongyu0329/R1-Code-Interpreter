We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n-1, 7, 20\n6, 16, -4\n9, 13, 7\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     -1, 7, 20\n     6, 16, -4\n     9, 13, 7\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 3x3 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is `3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is `3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of 2x2 = 4 sliding windows.\n\n3. **Identify Each Sliding Window and Calculate the Maximum**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     -1, 7\n     6, 16\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 16\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     7, 20\n     16, -4\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window 3 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     6, 16\n     9, 13\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 16\n\n   - **Window 4 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     16, -4\n     13, 7\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 16\n\n4. **Arrange the Maximum Values in a New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix formed by the maximum values from each sliding window, arranged according to their original positions, is:\n     ```\n     16, 20\n     16, 16\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The result of the max pooling operation is the 2x2 matrix:\n     ```\n     16, 20\n     16, 16\n     ```\n\nAnswer:\n```\n16, 20\n16, 16\n```"
