    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window:**\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix:**\n   - Start from the top-left corner and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix:**\n   - The resulting matrix will be 3x3, as there are 3 possible positions horizontally and 3 vertically.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10 & -7 & -7 \\\\\n  -4 & 14 & 20 \\\\\n  3 & -9 & 3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-10 + (-7) + (-7) + (-4) + 14 + 20 + 3 + (-9) + 3}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} = 0.33\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Top-middle):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -7 & -7 & 4 \\\\\n  14 & 20 & -5 \\\\\n  -9 & 3 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-7 + (-7) + 4 + 14 + 20 + (-5) + (-9) + 3 + (-9)}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} = 0.44\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Top-right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -7 & 4 & 12 \\\\\n  20 & -5 & 20 \\\\\n  3 & -9 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-7 + 4 + 12 + 20 + (-5) + 20 + 3 + (-9) + 5}{9} = \\frac{43}{9} = 4.78\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Middle-left):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -4 & 14 & 20 \\\\\n  3 & -9 & 3 \\\\\n  12 & -1 & -4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-4 + 14 + 20 + 3 + (-9) + 3 + 12 + (-1) + (-4)}{9} = \\frac{34}{9} = 3.78\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Middle-middle):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & 20 & -5 \\\\\n  -9 & 3 & -9 \\\\\n  -1 & -4 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{14 + 20 + (-5) + (-9) + 3 + (-9) + (-1) + (-4) + (-2)}{9} = \\frac{7}{9} = 0.78\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Middle-right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & -5 & 20 \\\\\n  3 & -9 & 5 \\\\\n  -4 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{20 + (-5) + 20 + 3 + (-9) + 5 + (-4) + (-2) + 5}{9} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.67\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Bottom-left):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & -9 & 3 \\\\\n  12 & -1 & -4 \\\\\n  6 & -7 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{3 + (-9) + 3 + 12 + (-1) + (-4) + 6 + (-7) + (-6)}{9} = \\frac{-3}{9} = -0.33\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Bottom-middle):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -9 & 3 & -9 \\\\\n  -1 & -4 & -2 \\\\\n  -7 & -6 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{-9 + 3 + (-9) + (-1) + (-4) + (-2) + (-7) + (-6) + 9}{9} = \\frac{-26}{9} = -2.89\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Bottom-right):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & -9 & 5 \\\\\n  -4 & -2 & 5 \\\\\n  -6 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\(\\frac{3 + (-9) + 5 + (-4) + (-2) + 5 + (-6) + 9 + 10}{9} = \\frac{11}{9} = 1.22\\)\n\n6. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - The new matrix formed by the averages is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   0.33 & 0.44 & 4.78 \\\\\n   3.78 & 0.78 & 3.67 \\\\\n   -0.33 & -2.89 & 1.22 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.33 & 0.44 & 4.78 \\\\\n3.78 & 0.78 & 3.67 \\\\\n-0.33 & -2.89 & 1.22 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
