    "To perform average pooling on the given 6x6 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 6x6, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 6x6 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(6 - 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) windows in total.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window Across the Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right until the end of the row is reached.\n   - Move the window down one row and repeat the process until the bottom of the matrix is reached.\n\n5. **Store the Averages in a New Matrix**:\n   - The resulting averages from each window will form a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations for each window:\n\n- **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  17 & -6 & 2 \\\\\n  5 & -8 & -4 \\\\\n  10 & 6 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((17 + (-6) + 2 + 5 + (-8) + (-4) + 10 + 6 + (-2)) / 9 = 20 / 9 \\approx 2.22\\)\n\n- **Window 2 (Shift right by 1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -6 & 2 & 10 \\\\\n  -8 & -4 & 12 \\\\\n  6 & -2 & -3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-6 + 2 + 10 + (-8) + (-4) + 12 + 6 + (-2) + (-3)) / 9 = 7 / 9 \\approx 0.78\\)\n\n- **Window 3 (Shift right by 2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 10 & 6 \\\\\n  -4 & 12 & 7 \\\\\n  -2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((2 + 10 + 6 + (-4) + 12 + 7 + (-2) + (-3) + 4) / 9 = 32 / 9 \\approx 3.56\\)\n\n- **Window 4 (Shift right by 3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 6 & 1 \\\\\n  12 & 7 & -2 \\\\\n  -3 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((10 + 6 + 1 + 12 + 7 + (-2) + (-3) + 4 + 2) / 9 = 37 / 9 \\approx 4.11\\)\n\n- **Window 5 (Move down, start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & -8 & -4 \\\\\n  10 & 6 & -2 \\\\\n  6 & 5 & 13 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((5 + (-8) + (-4) + 10 + 6 + (-2) + 6 + 5 + 13) / 9 = 31 / 9 \\approx 3.44\\)\n\n- **Window 6 (Shift right by 1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -8 & -4 & 12 \\\\\n  6 & -2 & -3 \\\\\n  5 & 13 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-8 + (-4) + 12 + 6 + (-2) + (-3) + 5 + 13 + (-2)) / 9 = 17 / 9 \\approx 1.89\\)\n\n- **Window 7 (Shift right by 2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -4 & 12 & 7 \\\\\n  -2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n  13 & -2 & 18 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-4 + 12 + 7 + (-2) + (-3) + 4 + 13 + (-2) + 18) / 9 = 43 / 9 \\approx 4.78\\)\n\n- **Window 8 (Shift right by 3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  12 & 7 & -2 \\\\\n  -3 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n  -2 & 18 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((12 + 7 + (-2) + (-3) + 4 + 2 + (-2) + 18 + 15) / 9 = 51 / 9 \\approx 5.67\\)\n\n- **Window 9 (Move down, start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 6 & -2 \\\\\n  6 & 5 & 13 \\\\\n  10 & -8 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((10 + 6 + (-2) + 6 + 5 + 13 + 10 + (-8) + 6) / 9 = 46 / 9 \\approx 5.11\\)\n\n- **Window 10 (Shift right by 1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  6 & -2 & -3 \\\\\n  5 & 13 & -2 \\\\\n  -8 & 6 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((6 + (-2) + (-3) + 5 + 13 + (-2) + (-8) + 6 + 5) / 9 = 20 / 9 \\approx 2.22\\)\n\n- **Window 11 (Shift right by 2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n  13 & -2 & 18 \\\\\n  6 & 5 & -9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-2 + (-3) + 4 + 13 + (-2) + 18 + 6 + 5 + (-9)) / 9 = 30 / 9 \\approx 3.33\\)\n\n- **Window 12 (Shift right by 3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -3 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n  -2 & 18 & 15 \\\\\n  5 & -9 & -8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((-3 + 4 + 2 + (-2) + 18 + 15 + 5 + (-9) + (-8)) / 9 = 22 / 9 \\approx 2.44\\)\n\n- **Window 13 (Move down, start from left)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  6 & 5 & 13 \\\\\n  10 & -8 & 6 \\\\\n  17 & -7 & 16 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((6 + 5 + 13 + 10 + (-8) + 6 + 17 + (-7) + 16) / 9 = 58 / 9 \\approx 6.44\\)\n\n- **Window 14 (Shift right by 1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 13 & -2 \\\\\n  -8 & 6 & 5 \\\\\n  -7 & 16 & 7 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = \\((5 + 13 + (-2) + (-8) + 6 + 5 + (-7) + 16 + 7) / 9 = 35 / 9 \\approx 3.89\\)\n\n- **Window 15 (Shift right by 2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix"
