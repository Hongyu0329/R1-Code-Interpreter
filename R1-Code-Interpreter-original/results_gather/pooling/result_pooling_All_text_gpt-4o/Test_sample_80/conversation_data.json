    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will cover 3 rows and 3 columns at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - Horizontally, the window can start at columns 1, 2, and 3 (0-indexed).\n   - Vertically, the window can start at rows 1, 2, and 3 (0-indexed).\n   - This results in a total of 3x3 = 9 possible windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n   - The average is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the window divided by 9.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and slide the window to the right and then down.\n   - For each position, calculate the average and store it in a new matrix.\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix will be a 3x3 matrix, as there are 3 possible horizontal and 3 possible vertical positions for the window.\n\nLet's calculate the averages for each window:\n\n- **Window starting at (0,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 5 & 3 \\\\\n  -10 & -3 & 11 \\\\\n  -3 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (0 + 5 + 3 - 10 - 3 + 11 - 3 + 2 + 5) / 9 = 1.11\n\n- **Window starting at (0,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 3 & 10 \\\\\n  -3 & 11 & -3 \\\\\n  2 & 5 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (5 + 3 + 10 - 3 + 11 - 3 + 2 + 5 - 5) / 9 = 2.78\n\n- **Window starting at (0,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 10 & -7 \\\\\n  11 & -3 & 19 \\\\\n  5 & -5 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (3 + 10 - 7 + 11 - 3 + 19 + 5 - 5 - 1) / 9 = 3.67\n\n- **Window starting at (1,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10 & -3 & 11 \\\\\n  -3 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n  2 & -9 & 12 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-10 - 3 + 11 - 3 + 2 + 5 + 2 - 9 + 12) / 9 = 0.78\n\n- **Window starting at (1,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -3 & 11 & -3 \\\\\n  2 & 5 & -5 \\\\\n  -9 & 12 & 8 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-3 + 11 - 3 + 2 + 5 - 5 - 9 + 12 + 8) / 9 = 2.00\n\n- **Window starting at (1,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & -3 & 19 \\\\\n  5 & -5 & -1 \\\\\n  12 & 8 & 5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (11 - 3 + 19 + 5 - 5 - 1 + 12 + 8 + 5) / 9 = 5.67\n\n- **Window starting at (2,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -3 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n  2 & -9 & 12 \\\\\n  3 & 18 & -6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-3 + 2 + 5 + 2 - 9 + 12 + 3 + 18 - 6) / 9 = 2.67\n\n- **Window starting at (2,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 5 & -5 \\\\\n  -9 & 12 & 8 \\\\\n  18 & -6 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (2 + 5 - 5 - 9 + 12 + 8 + 18 - 6 + 6) / 9 = 3.44\n\n- **Window starting at (2,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & -5 & -1 \\\\\n  12 & 8 & 5 \\\\\n  -6 & 6 & 15 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (5 - 5 - 1 + 12 + 8 + 5 - 6 + 6 + 15) / 9 = 4.33\n\n6. **Output the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix formed by the averages is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   1.11 & 2.78 & 3.67 \\\\\n   0.78 & 2.00 & 5.67 \\\\\n   2.67 & 3.44 & 4.33 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.11 & 2.78 & 3.67 \\\\\n0.78 & 2.00 & 5.67 \\\\\n2.67 & 3.44 & 4.33 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
