    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     -1, 11, -10, 8\n     8, 13, -9, 13\n     -8, 12, 5, 0\n     -6, -6, 20, -9\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - The number of windows vertically = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of 3x3 = 9 windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     -1, 11\n     8, 13\n     ```\n     Average = (-1 + 11 + 8 + 13) / 4 = 31 / 4 = 7.75\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     ```\n     11, -10\n     13, -9\n     ```\n     Average = (11 - 10 + 13 - 9) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     -10, 8\n     -9, 13\n     ```\n     Average = (-10 + 8 - 9 + 13) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 0.5\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     8, 13\n     -8, 12\n     ```\n     Average = (8 + 13 - 8 + 12) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\n\n   - **Window 5 (Center)**:\n     ```\n     13, -9\n     12, 5\n     ```\n     Average = (13 - 9 + 12 + 5) / 4 = 21 / 4 = 5.25\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     -9, 13\n     5, 0\n     ```\n     Average = (-9 + 13 + 5 + 0) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     -8, 12\n     -6, -6\n     ```\n     Average = (-8 + 12 - 6 - 6) / 4 = -8 / 4 = -2\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle)**:\n     ```\n     12, 5\n     -6, 20\n     ```\n     Average = (12 + 5 - 6 + 20) / 4 = 31 / 4 = 7.75\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     5, 0\n     20, -9\n     ```\n     Average = (5 + 0 + 20 - 9) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     7.75, 1.25, 0.5\n     6.25, 5.25, 2.25\n     -2, 7.75, 4\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n7.75, 1.25, 0.5\n6.25, 5.25, 2.25\n-2, 7.75, 4\n```"
