    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     11, 15, 18, 18\n     20, -8, -4, 19\n     14, -9, 11, -7\n     -9, 2, -7, 2\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix with a 2x2 window, the number of windows is (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 in both directions.\n\n3. **Slide the Window and Find Maximum Values**:\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each window.\n   - The windows and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **First Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       11, 15\n       20, -8\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 20\n     - Window 2:\n       ```\n       15, 18\n       -8, -4\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 18\n     - Window 3:\n       ```\n       18, 18\n       -4, 19\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 4:\n       ```\n       20, -8\n       14, -9\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 20\n     - Window 5:\n       ```\n       -8, -4\n       -9, 11\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 11\n     - Window 6:\n       ```\n       -4, 19\n       11, -7\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 7:\n       ```\n       14, -9\n       -9, 2\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 14\n     - Window 8:\n       ```\n       -9, 11\n       2, -7\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 11\n     - Window 9:\n       ```\n       11, -7\n       -7, 2\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 11\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in the order of their original window positions to form a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     20, 18, 19\n     20, 11, 19\n     14, 11, 11\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after max pooling, is:\n```\n20, 18, 19\n20, 11, 19\n14, 11, 11\n```"
