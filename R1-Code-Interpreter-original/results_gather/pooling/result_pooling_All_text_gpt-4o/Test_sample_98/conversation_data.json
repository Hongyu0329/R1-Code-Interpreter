    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 6x6 grid. The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will slide over the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**: Since the matrix is 6x6 and the sliding window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically. The number of positions the window can take is determined by subtracting the window size from the matrix size and adding 1. Therefore, the window can slide to (6-3+1) = 4 positions both horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Calculate Averages for Each Window**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window. This involves summing the numbers and dividing by 9.\n\n4. **Arrange the Averages into a New Matrix**: The resulting averages from each sliding window position will form a new matrix. Since the window can slide to 4 positions horizontally and 4 positions vertically, the new matrix will be 4x4.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Window (1,1) to (3,3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(-10 + 19 - 7 + 20 - 9 - 5 + 12 + 4 + 16)}{9} = \\frac{40}{9} \\approx 4.44\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (1,2) to (3,4)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(19 - 7 + 11 - 9 - 5 + 0 + 4 + 16 - 8)}{9} = \\frac{21}{9} \\approx 2.33\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (1,3) to (3,5)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(-7 + 11 - 3 - 5 + 0 + 15 + 16 - 8 + 16)}{9} = \\frac{35}{9} \\approx 3.89\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (1,4) to (3,6)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(11 - 3 - 3 + 0 + 15 - 1 - 8 + 16 - 1)}{9} = \\frac{26}{9} \\approx 2.89\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (2,1) to (4,3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(20 - 9 - 5 + 12 + 4 + 16 + 2 + 7 + 20)}{9} = \\frac{67}{9} \\approx 7.44\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (2,2) to (4,4)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(-9 - 5 + 0 + 4 + 16 - 8 + 7 + 20 - 8)}{9} = \\frac{17}{9} \\approx 1.89\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (2,3) to (4,5)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(-5 + 0 + 15 + 16 - 8 + 16 + 20 - 8 - 10)}{9} = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (2,4) to (4,6)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(0 + 15 - 1 - 8 + 16 - 1 - 8 - 10 + 6)}{9} = \\frac{9}{9} = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (3,1) to (5,3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(12 + 4 + 16 + 2 + 7 + 20 + 19 + 4 - 8)}{9} = \\frac{76}{9} \\approx 8.44\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (3,2) to (5,4)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(4 + 16 - 8 + 7 + 20 - 8 + 4 - 8 + 5)}{9} = \\frac{32}{9} \\approx 3.56\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (3,3) to (5,5)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(16 - 8 + 16 + 20 - 8 - 10 - 8 + 5 + 15)}{9} = \\frac{38}{9} \\approx 4.22\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (3,4) to (5,6)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(-8 + 16 - 1 - 8 - 10 + 6 + 5 + 15 + 3)}{9} = \\frac{18}{9} = 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (4,1) to (6,3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(2 + 7 + 20 + 19 + 4 - 8 + 6 + 19 + 2)}{9} = \\frac{71}{9} \\approx 7.89\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (4,2) to (6,4)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(7 + 20 - 8 + 4 - 8 + 5 + 19 + 2 - 5)}{9} = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (4,3) to (6,5)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(20 - 8 - 10 - 8 + 5 + 15 + 2 - 5 - 6)}{9} = \\frac{5}{9} \\approx 0.56\n  \\]\n\n- **Window (4,4) to (6,6)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(-8 - 10 + 6 + 5 + 15 + 3 - 5 - 6 + 20)}{9} = \\frac{20}{9} \\approx 2.22\n  \\]\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**: Arrange these averages into a 4x4 matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4.44 & 2.33 & 3.89 & 2.89 \\\\\n7.44 & 1.89 & 4 & 1 \\\\\n8.44 & 3.56 & 4.22 & 2 \\\\\n7.89 & 4 & 0.56 & 2.22\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is the 4x4 matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4.44 & 2.33 & 3.89 & 2.89 \\\\\n7.44 & 1.89 & 4 & 1 \\\\\n8.44 & 3.56 & 4.22 & 2 \\\\\n7.89 & 4 & 0.56 & 2.22\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
