    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 6x6 grid. The sliding window is 3x3, which means it will slide over the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 sub-matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**: Since the matrix is 6x6 and the sliding window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically. The number of positions the window can take is determined by the formula (N-n+1) for both dimensions, where N is the matrix size and n is the window size. Here, (6-3+1) = 4. So, the window can slide to 4 positions horizontally and 4 positions vertically.\n\n3. **Calculate Averages for Each Window**: For each position of the sliding window, calculate the average of the 9 numbers within the window.\n\n4. **Arrange the Averages into a New Matrix**: The resulting averages from each window position will form a new 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Position (0,0)**: \n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 4 & 11 \\\\\n  0 & 5 & 3 \\\\\n  20 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (2 + 4 + 11 + 0 + 5 + 3 + 20 + 2 + 0) / 9 = 5.222\n\n- **Position (0,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & 11 & -2 \\\\\n  5 & 3 & 15 \\\\\n  2 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (4 + 11 - 2 + 5 + 3 + 15 + 2 + 0 + 4) / 9 = 4.666\n\n- **Position (0,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  11 & -2 & -10 \\\\\n  3 & 15 & -7 \\\\\n  0 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (11 - 2 - 10 + 3 + 15 - 7 + 0 + 4 + 0) / 9 = 1.555\n\n- **Position (0,3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & -10 & 8 \\\\\n  15 & -7 & 10 \\\\\n  4 & 0 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-2 - 10 + 8 + 15 - 7 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 6) / 9 = 2.666\n\n- **Position (1,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 5 & 3 \\\\\n  20 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n  14 & 9 & -5 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (0 + 5 + 3 + 20 + 2 + 0 + 14 + 9 - 5) / 9 = 5.333\n\n- **Position (1,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  5 & 3 & 15 \\\\\n  2 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n  9 & -5 & 10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (5 + 3 + 15 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 9 - 5 + 10) / 9 = 4.777\n\n- **Position (1,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  3 & 15 & -7 \\\\\n  0 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n  -5 & 10 & 6 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (3 + 15 - 7 + 0 + 4 + 0 - 5 + 10 + 6) / 9 = 2.888\n\n- **Position (1,3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  15 & -7 & 10 \\\\\n  4 & 0 & 6 \\\\\n  10 & 6 & 17 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (15 - 7 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 6 + 10 + 6 + 17) / 9 = 6.777\n\n- **Position (2,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  20 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n  14 & 9 & -5 \\\\\n  -7 & 17 & 4 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (20 + 2 + 0 + 14 + 9 - 5 - 7 + 17 + 4) / 9 = 6.444\n\n- **Position (2,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  2 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n  9 & -5 & 10 \\\\\n  17 & 4 & -3 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (2 + 0 + 4 + 9 - 5 + 10 + 17 + 4 - 3) / 9 = 4.222\n\n- **Position (2,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n  -5 & 10 & 6 \\\\\n  4 & -3 & 20 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (0 + 4 + 0 - 5 + 10 + 6 + 4 - 3 + 20) / 9 = 4.000\n\n- **Position (2,3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  4 & 0 & 6 \\\\\n  10 & 6 & 17 \\\\\n  -3 & 20 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (4 + 0 + 6 + 10 + 6 + 17 - 3 + 20 + 0) / 9 = 6.666\n\n- **Position (3,0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  14 & 9 & -5 \\\\\n  -7 & 17 & 4 \\\\\n  8 & 9 & 13 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (14 + 9 - 5 - 7 + 17 + 4 + 8 + 9 + 13) / 9 = 7.111\n\n- **Position (3,1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  9 & -5 & 10 \\\\\n  17 & 4 & -3 \\\\\n  9 & 13 & -10 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (9 - 5 + 10 + 17 + 4 - 3 + 9 + 13 - 10) / 9 = 4.888\n\n- **Position (3,2)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -5 & 10 & 6 \\\\\n  4 & -3 & 20 \\\\\n  13 & -10 & -2 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (-5 + 10 + 6 + 4 - 3 + 20 + 13 - 10 - 2) / 9 = 3.666\n\n- **Position (3,3)**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  10 & 6 & 17 \\\\\n  -3 & 20 & 0 \\\\\n  -10 & -2 & 11 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  Average = (10 + 6 + 17 - 3 + 20 + 0 - 10 - 2 + 11) / 9 = 5.444\n\n**Final 4x4 Matrix of Averages**:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5.222 & 4.666 & 1.555 & 2.666 \\\\\n5.333 & 4.777 & 2.888 & 6.777 \\\\\n6.444 & 4.222 & 4.000 & 6.666 \\\\\n7.111 & 4.888 & 3.666 & 5.444 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is the 4x4 matrix of averages:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5.222 & 4.666 & "
