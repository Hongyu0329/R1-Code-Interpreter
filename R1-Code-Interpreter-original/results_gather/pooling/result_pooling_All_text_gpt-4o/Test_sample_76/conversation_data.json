    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid.\n   - The sliding window is 3x3, which means we will calculate the average of each 3x3 sub-matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, each producing one average value.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, sum all the elements and divide by 9 (since there are 9 elements in each window).\n\n4. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 + 5 - 4 + 2 - 4 - 5 - 3 + 18 - 6}{9} = \\frac{18}{9} = 2\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5 - 4 + 6 - 4 - 5 + 4 + 18 - 6 - 9}{9} = \\frac{5}{9} \\approx 0.56\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-4 + 6 + 7 - 5 + 4 - 8 - 6 - 9 - 5}{9} = \\frac{-20}{9} \\approx -2.22\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 - 4 - 5 - 3 + 18 - 6 - 8 - 6 - 2}{9} = \\frac{-14}{9} \\approx -1.56\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-4 - 5 + 4 + 18 - 6 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 6}{9} = \\frac{-16}{9} \\approx -1.78\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-5 + 4 - 8 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 2 - 6 + 15}{9} = \\frac{-22}{9} \\approx -2.44\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-3 + 18 - 6 - 8 - 6 - 2 + 4 + 1 - 2}{9} = \\frac{-4}{9} \\approx -0.44\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{18 - 6 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 6 + 1 - 2 - 7}{9} = \\frac{-19}{9} \\approx -2.11\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-6 - 9 - 5 - 2 - 6 + 15 - 2 - 7 + 13}{9} = \\frac{-9}{9} = -1\n     \\]\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     2 & 0.56 & -2.22 \\\\\n     -1.56 & -1.78 & -2.44 \\\\\n     -0.44 & -2.11 & -1\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0.56 & -2.22 \\\\\n-1.56 & -1.78 & -2.44 \\\\\n-0.44 & -2.11 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
