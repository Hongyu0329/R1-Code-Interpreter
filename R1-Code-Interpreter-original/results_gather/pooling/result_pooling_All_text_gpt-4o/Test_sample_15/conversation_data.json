  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 2*2 sliding window:\n9, -5, -5\n-5, 6, 1\n19, 16, 12\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 grid:\n     ```\n     9, -5, -5\n     -5, 6, 1\n     19, 16, 12\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 3x3 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of possible positions for the top-left corner of the 2x2 window is determined by subtracting the window size from the matrix size and adding 1.\n   - For a 3x3 matrix and a 2x2 window, the window can start at:\n     - Row positions: 0 to 1 (2 positions)\n     - Column positions: 0 to 1 (2 positions)\n\n3. **Slide the Window and Find Maximum Values**:\n   - **Position (0,0)**: The window covers:\n     ```\n     9, -5\n     -5, 6\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 9.\n   \n   - **Position (0,1)**: The window covers:\n     ```\n     -5, -5\n     6, 1\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 6.\n   \n   - **Position (1,0)**: The window covers:\n     ```\n     -5, 6\n     19, 16\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 19.\n   \n   - **Position (1,1)**: The window covers:\n     ```\n     6, 1\n     16, 12\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 16.\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values according to the positions of the sliding windows:\n     ```\n     9, 6\n     19, 16\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - The resulting matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n     ```\n     9, 6\n     19, 16\n     ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n9, 6\n19, 16\n```"
