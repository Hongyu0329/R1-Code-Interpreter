    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     9, 11, 15, -9\n     8, -3, 1, 5\n     4, -9, 7, 11\n     7, -8, 0, 6\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of windows vertically is \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers in the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     - Elements: 9, 11, 8, -3\n     - Average: \\((9 + 11 + 8 - 3) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\\)\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center)**:\n     - Elements: 11, 15, -3, 1\n     - Average: \\((11 + 15 - 3 + 1) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6.0\\)\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     - Elements: 15, -9, 1, 5\n     - Average: \\((15 - 9 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3.0\\)\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     - Elements: 8, -3, 4, -9\n     - Average: \\((8 - 3 + 4 - 9) / 4 = 0 / 4 = 0.0\\)\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n     - Elements: -3, 1, -9, 7\n     - Average: \\((-3 + 1 - 9 + 7) / 4 = -4 / 4 = -1.0\\)\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     - Elements: 1, 5, 7, 11\n     - Average: \\((1 + 5 + 7 + 11) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6.0\\)\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     - Elements: 4, -9, 7, -8\n     - Average: \\((4 - 9 + 7 - 8) / 4 = -6 / 4 = -1.5\\)\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n     - Elements: -9, 7, -8, 0\n     - Average: \\((-9 + 7 - 8 + 0) / 4 = -10 / 4 = -2.5\\)\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right)**:\n     - Elements: 7, 11, 0, 6\n     - Average: \\((7 + 11 + 0 + 6) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6.0\\)\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix, corresponding to the positions of the windows:\n     ```\n     6.25, 6.0, 3.0\n     0.0, -1.0, 6.0\n     -1.5, -2.5, 6.0\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n6.25, 6.0, 3.0\n0.0, -1.0, 6.0\n-1.5, -2.5, 6.0\n```"
