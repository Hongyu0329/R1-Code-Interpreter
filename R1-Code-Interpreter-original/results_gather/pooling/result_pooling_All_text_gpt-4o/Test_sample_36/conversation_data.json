    "To perform max pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to find the maximum value in each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows.\n\n3. **Slide the Window and Find Maximums**:\n   - For each position of the sliding window, identify the 3x3 sub-matrix and find the maximum value.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum for Each Window**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     ```\n     -7, -7, 3\n     -2, -10, 16\n     20, 11, 6\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     ```\n     -7, 3, 20\n     -10, 16, -7\n     11, 6, -5\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     ```\n     3, 20, 2\n     16, -7, 4\n     6, -5, -6\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     ```\n     -2, -10, 16\n     20, 11, 6\n     7, 20, 12\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     ```\n     -10, 16, -7\n     11, 6, -5\n     20, 12, 7\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     ```\n     16, -7, 4\n     6, -5, -6\n     12, 7, -5\n     ```\n     Maximum = 16\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     ```\n     20, 11, 6\n     7, 20, 12\n     15, -1, 17\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     ```\n     11, 6, -5\n     20, 12, 7\n     -1, 17, 5\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     ```\n     6, -5, -6\n     12, 7, -5\n     17, 5, 3\n     ```\n     Maximum = 17\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in the order of the windows:\n     ```\n     20, 20, 20\n     20, 20, 16\n     20, 20, 17\n     ```\n\nThe final 3x3 matrix after max pooling is:\n```\n20, 20, 20\n20, 20, 16\n20, 20, 17\n```"
