    "To perform average pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The matrix is 5x5, and the sliding window is 3x3.\n   - The sliding window will move across the matrix to calculate the average of each 3x3 section.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The window can start at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) horizontally and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) vertically.\n   - This results in a 3x3 grid of windows, each producing one average value.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, sum all the elements and divide by 9 (since there are 9 elements in a 3x3 window).\n\n4. **Perform Calculations**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(-3) + (-4) + (-3) + (-6) + 13 + 10 + 20 + 15 + (-6)}{9} = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (0,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(-4) + (-3) + (-5) + 13 + 10 + 13 + 15 + (-6) + 8}{9} = \\frac{41}{9} \\approx 4.56\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (0,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(-3) + (-5) + 5 + 10 + 13 + 5 + (-6) + 8 + 9}{9} = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(-6) + 13 + 10 + 20 + 15 + (-6) + 8 + 9 + 4}{9} = \\frac{67}{9} \\approx 7.44\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{13 + 10 + 13 + 15 + (-6) + 8 + 9 + 4 + 4}{9} = \\frac{70}{9} \\approx 7.78\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (1,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10 + 13 + 5 + (-6) + 8 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 10}{9} = \\frac{57}{9} = 6.33\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,0):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20 + 15 + (-6) + 8 + 9 + 4 + (-1) + 7 + (-2)}{9} = \\frac{54}{9} = 6\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,1):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 + (-6) + 8 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 7 + (-2) + 1}{9} = \\frac{40}{9} \\approx 4.44\n     \\]\n   - **Window starting at (2,2):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(-6) + 8 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 10 + (-2) + 1 + (-7)}{9} = \\frac{21}{9} \\approx 2.33\n     \\]\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     4 & 4.56 & 4 \\\\\n     7.44 & 7.78 & 6.33 \\\\\n     6 & 4.44 & 2.33\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is the new matrix formed by the average pooling operation:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 4.56 & 4 \\\\\n7.44 & 7.78 & 6.33 \\\\\n6 & 4.44 & 2.33\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
