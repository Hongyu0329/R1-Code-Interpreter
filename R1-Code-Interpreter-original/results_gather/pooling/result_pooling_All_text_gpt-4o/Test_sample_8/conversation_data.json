    "To perform max pooling on the given 3x3 matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     -9, 1, 18\n     0, 19, -1\n     10, 14, -1\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means it will cover 4 elements at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 3x3 and the sliding window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The possible top-left positions for the sliding window are:\n     - (0,0), (0,1)\n     - (1,0), (1,1)\n\n3. **Apply the Sliding Window and Find Maximums:**\n   - For each position, extract the 2x2 sub-matrix and find the maximum value.\n\n   - **Position (0,0):**\n     ```\n     -9, 1\n     0, 19\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Position (0,1):**\n     ```\n     1, 18\n     19, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Position (1,0):**\n     ```\n     0, 19\n     10, 14\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n   - **Position (1,1):**\n     ```\n     19, -1\n     14, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 19\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values according to the positions of the sliding windows:\n     ```\n     19, 19\n     19, 19\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The resulting matrix after max pooling is:\n     ```\n     <<<19, 19, 19, 19>>>\n     ```\n\nAnswer: <<<19, 19, 19, 19>>>"
