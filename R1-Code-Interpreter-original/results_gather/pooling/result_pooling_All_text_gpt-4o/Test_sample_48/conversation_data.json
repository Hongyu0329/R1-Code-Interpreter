  "question": "In an N*N grid, there are N^2 numbers, with numbers in the same row separated by commas. We define the \"max pooling\" operation: suppose that there is an n*n (n<N) sliding window, which slides from left to right or from top to bottom in the matrix, finding the maximum value in each sliding window. Then, the maximum values are arranged according to their original positions to form a new matrix for output.\nNow, please perform max pooling on the following matrix by using a 3*3 sliding window:\n14, 6, 9, 15, 13\n18, 7, 18, 8, -4\n0, 17, -6, -1, 3\n-4, 6, 8, 9, -10\n4, -8, 20, 10, 3\nFor example, <<<0,0,0,0>>> represents a 2D array.",

    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 grid:\n     ```\n     14, 6, 9, 15, 13\n     18, 7, 18, 8, -4\n     0, 17, -6, -1, 3\n     -4, 6, 8, 9, -10\n     4, -8, 20, 10, 3\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 3x3.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of positions the window can take horizontally is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - The number of positions the window can take vertically is \\(5 - 3 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 3x3 window position, find the maximum value within that window.\n   - Slide the window across the matrix and record the maximum values.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum for Each Window**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     14, 6, 9\n     18, 7, 18\n     0, 17, -6\n     ```\n     Maximum = 18\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center)**:\n     ```\n     6, 9, 15\n     7, 18, 8\n     17, -6, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum = 18\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     9, 15, 13\n     18, 8, -4\n     -6, -1, 3\n     ```\n     Maximum = 18\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     18, 7, 18\n     0, 17, -6\n     -4, 6, 8\n     ```\n     Maximum = 18\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center)**:\n     ```\n     7, 18, 8\n     17, -6, -1\n     6, 8, 9\n     ```\n     Maximum = 18\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     18, 8, -4\n     -6, -1, 3\n     8, 9, -10\n     ```\n     Maximum = 18\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left)**:\n     ```\n     0, 17, -6\n     -4, 6, 8\n     4, -8, 20\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center)**:\n     ```\n     17, -6, -1\n     6, 8, 9\n     -8, 20, 10\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right)**:\n     ```\n     -6, -1, 3\n     8, 9, -10\n     20, 10, 3\n     ```\n     Maximum = 20\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix according to their original window positions:\n     ```\n     18, 18, 18\n     18, 18, 18\n     20, 20, 20\n     ```\n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling with a 3x3 sliding window is:\n```\n18, 18, 18\n18, 18, 18\n20, 20, 20\n```"
