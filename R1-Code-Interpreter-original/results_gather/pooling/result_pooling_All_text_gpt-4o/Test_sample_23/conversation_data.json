    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     7,  2,  4, 13\n     18, 13, 10, 13\n     8, 15, 19,  0\n     -4, 7,  9, -5\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix with a 2x2 window, there will be (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 windows in each direction.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each window.\n   - The windows and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **First Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       7,  2\n       18, 13\n       ```\n       Max value = 18\n     - Window 2:\n       ```\n       2,  4\n       13, 10\n       ```\n       Max value = 13\n     - Window 3:\n       ```\n       4, 13\n       10, 13\n       ```\n       Max value = 13\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 4:\n       ```\n       18, 13\n       8,  15\n       ```\n       Max value = 18\n     - Window 5:\n       ```\n       13, 10\n       15, 19\n       ```\n       Max value = 19\n     - Window 6:\n       ```\n       10, 13\n       19, 0\n       ```\n       Max value = 19\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 7:\n       ```\n       8,  15\n       -4, 7\n       ```\n       Max value = 15\n     - Window 8:\n       ```\n       15, 19\n       7,  9\n       ```\n       Max value = 19\n     - Window 9:\n       ```\n       19, 0\n       9, -5\n       ```\n       Max value = 19\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values from each window into a new matrix, maintaining the order of the windows:\n     ```\n     18, 13, 13\n     18, 19, 19\n     15, 19, 19\n     ```\n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling with a 2x2 sliding window is:\n```\n18, 13, 13\n18, 19, 19\n15, 19, 19\n```"
