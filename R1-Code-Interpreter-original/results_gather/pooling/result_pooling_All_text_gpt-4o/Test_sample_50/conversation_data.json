    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     2,  -7, -10,  1\n     14,  5,  18, -5\n     7,   7,  18, -9\n     9,   9,  10, -5\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - The number of windows vertically = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Therefore, there will be a total of 3x3 = 9 windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - For each 2x2 window, calculate the average of the four numbers within the window.\n\n4. **Slide the Window and Calculate Averages**:\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     2, -7\n     14, 5\n     ```\n     Average = (2 + (-7) + 14 + 5) / 4 = 14 / 4 = 3.5\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     ```\n     -7, -10\n     5, 18\n     ```\n     Average = (-7 + (-10) + 5 + 18) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     -10, 1\n     18, -5\n     ```\n     Average = (-10 + 1 + 18 + (-5)) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     14, 5\n     7, 7\n     ```\n     Average = (14 + 5 + 7 + 7) / 4 = 33 / 4 = 8.25\n\n   - **Window 5 (Center)**:\n     ```\n     5, 18\n     7, 18\n     ```\n     Average = (5 + 18 + 7 + 18) / 4 = 48 / 4 = 12\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     18, -5\n     18, -9\n     ```\n     Average = (18 + (-5) + 18 + (-9)) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     7, 7\n     9, 9\n     ```\n     Average = (7 + 7 + 9 + 9) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle)**:\n     ```\n     7, 18\n     9, 10\n     ```\n     Average = (7 + 18 + 9 + 10) / 4 = 44 / 4 = 11\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     18, -9\n     10, -5\n     ```\n     Average = (18 + (-9) + 10 + (-5)) / 4 = 14 / 4 = 3.5\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages in a 3x3 matrix according to their original positions:\n     ```\n     3.5, 1.5, 1\n     8.25, 12, 5.5\n     8, 11, 3.5\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n3.5, 1.5, 1\n8.25, 12, 5.5\n8, 11, 3.5\n```"
