    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     16, 4, 15, 5\n     16, 15, 4, 6\n     18, 1, -5, -2\n     8, 20, -10, 14\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the sliding window can move across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size. Here, N = 4 and n = 2, so we have (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 windows in each direction.\n\n3. **Slide the Window and Find Maximum Values**:\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and find the maximum value in each window.\n\n   - **First Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 1 (top-left corner): \n       ```\n       16, 4\n       16, 15\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 16\n\n     - Window 2 (shift right by one column):\n       ```\n       4, 15\n       15, 4\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 15\n\n     - Window 3 (shift right by one more column):\n       ```\n       15, 5\n       4, 6\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 15\n\n   - **Second Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 4 (shift down by one row):\n       ```\n       16, 15\n       18, 1\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 18\n\n     - Window 5 (shift right by one column):\n       ```\n       15, 4\n       1, -5\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 15\n\n     - Window 6 (shift right by one more column):\n       ```\n       4, 6\n       -5, -2\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 6\n\n   - **Third Row of Windows**:\n     - Window 7 (shift down by one more row):\n       ```\n       18, 1\n       8, 20\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 20\n\n     - Window 8 (shift right by one column):\n       ```\n       1, -5\n       20, -10\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 20\n\n     - Window 9 (shift right by one more column):\n       ```\n       -5, -2\n       -10, 14\n       ```\n       Maximum value = 14\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the maximum values from each window into a new 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     16, 15, 15\n     18, 15, 6\n     20, 20, 14\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after max pooling, is:\n```\n16, 15, 15\n18, 15, 6\n20, 20, 14\n```"
