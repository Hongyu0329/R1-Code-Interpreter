    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Sliding Window**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     16, 2, -9, 17\n     5, -3, -5, 2\n     3, 7, 19, -9\n     8, 5, -8, 12\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 2x2, which means it will cover 4 elements at a time.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide horizontally and vertically.\n   - Horizontally, the window can start at columns 0 and 1 (2 positions).\n   - Vertically, the window can start at rows 0 and 1 (2 positions).\n   - This results in a total of 2x2 = 4 possible positions for the sliding window.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Sliding Window**:\n   - **Window starting at (0,0)**:\n     ```\n     16, 2\n     5, -3\n     ```\n     Average = (16 + 2 + 5 - 3) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5\n\n   - **Window starting at (0,1)**:\n     ```\n     2, -9\n     -3, -5\n     ```\n     Average = (2 - 9 - 3 - 5) / 4 = -15 / 4 = -3.75\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,0)**:\n     ```\n     5, -3\n     3, 7\n     ```\n     Average = (5 - 3 + 3 + 7) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3\n\n   - **Window starting at (1,1)**:\n     ```\n     -3, -5\n     7, 19\n     ```\n     Average = (-3 - 5 + 7 + 19) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - The new matrix formed by the average values will be a 2x2 matrix:\n     ```\n     5, -3.75\n     3, 4.5\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final output matrix after performing average pooling is:\n     ```\n     5, -3.75\n     3, 4.5\n     ```\n\nAnswer:\n5, -3.75\n3, 4.5"
