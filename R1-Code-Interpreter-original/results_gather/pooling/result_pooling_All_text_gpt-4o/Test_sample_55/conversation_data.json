    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix using a 2x2 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size**:\n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 grid:\n     ```\n     14, 10, 8, -3\n     -4, 13, 8, 11\n     -8, -4, -9, 1\n     -9, 15, 8, 7\n     ```\n   - The sliding window size is 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Windows**:\n   - Since the matrix is 4x4 and the window is 2x2, the window can slide across the matrix both horizontally and vertically.\n   - The number of windows horizontally and vertically is calculated as (N - n + 1), where N is the matrix size and n is the window size.\n   - For a 4x4 matrix and a 2x2 window, the number of windows is (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 in both directions.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average for Each Window**:\n   - Slide the 2x2 window across the matrix and calculate the average for each position:\n   \n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     14, 10\n     -4, 13\n     ```\n     Average = (14 + 10 - 4 + 13) / 4 = 33 / 4 = 8.25\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-middle)**:\n     ```\n     10, 8\n     13, 8\n     ```\n     Average = (10 + 8 + 13 + 8) / 4 = 39 / 4 = 9.75\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     8, -3\n     8, 11\n     ```\n     Average = (8 - 3 + 8 + 11) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6.0\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left)**:\n     ```\n     -4, 13\n     -8, -4\n     ```\n     Average = (-4 + 13 - 8 - 4) / 4 = -3 / 4 = -0.75\n\n   - **Window 5 (Center)**:\n     ```\n     13, 8\n     -4, -9\n     ```\n     Average = (13 + 8 - 4 - 9) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2.0\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right)**:\n     ```\n     8, 11\n     -9, 1\n     ```\n     Average = (8 + 11 - 9 + 1) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left corner)**:\n     ```\n     -8, -4\n     -9, 15\n     ```\n     Average = (-8 - 4 - 9 + 15) / 4 = -6 / 4 = -1.5\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-middle)**:\n     ```\n     -4, -9\n     15, 8\n     ```\n     Average = (-4 - 9 + 15 + 8) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right corner)**:\n     ```\n     -9, 1\n     8, 7\n     ```\n     Average = (-9 + 1 + 8 + 7) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75\n\n4. **Form the New Matrix**:\n   - Arrange the calculated averages into a new 3x3 matrix, maintaining the order of the windows:\n     ```\n     8.25, 9.75, 6.0\n     -0.75, 2.0, 2.75\n     -1.5, 2.5, 1.75\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the new matrix after average pooling, is:\n```\n8.25, 9.75, 6.0\n-0.75, 2.0, 2.75\n-1.5, 2.5, 1.75\n```"
