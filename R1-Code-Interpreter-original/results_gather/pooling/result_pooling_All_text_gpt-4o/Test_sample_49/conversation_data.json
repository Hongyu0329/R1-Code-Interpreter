    "To perform max pooling on the given 5x5 matrix using a 3x3 sliding window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Window Size:**\n   - The matrix is a 5x5 grid:\n     ```\n     0,  -9,  4, -4, 16\n     13, -8,  8,  6, 20\n     16, -8, -1, 20,  7\n     18,  2, -5,  4, -1\n     8,   5, -2, 18, -3\n     ```\n   - The sliding window is 3x3.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sliding Windows:**\n   - Since the matrix is 5x5 and the window is 3x3, the window can slide:\n     - Horizontally: 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 positions (left to right)\n     - Vertically: 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 positions (top to bottom)\n   - This results in a total of 3x3 = 9 sliding windows.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling:**\n   - For each 3x3 window, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the new matrix.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum Values for Each Window:**\n   - **Window 1 (Top-left corner):**\n     ```\n     0,  -9,  4\n     13, -8,  8\n     16, -8, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 16\n\n   - **Window 2 (Top-center):**\n     ```\n     -9,  4, -4\n     -8,  8,  6\n     -8, -1, 20\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window 3 (Top-right corner):**\n     ```\n     4, -4, 16\n     8,  6, 20\n     -1, 20, 7\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window 4 (Middle-left):**\n     ```\n     13, -8,  8\n     16, -8, -1\n     18,  2, -5\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 18\n\n   - **Window 5 (Middle-center):**\n     ```\n     -8,  8,  6\n     -8, -1, 20\n     2, -5,  4\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window 6 (Middle-right):**\n     ```\n     8,  6, 20\n     -1, 20, 7\n     -5,  4, -1\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window 7 (Bottom-left):**\n     ```\n     16, -8, -1\n     18,  2, -5\n     8,  5, -2\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 18\n\n   - **Window 8 (Bottom-center):**\n     ```\n     -8, -1, 20\n     2, -5,  4\n     5, -2, 18\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n   - **Window 9 (Bottom-right):**\n     ```\n     -1, 20, 7\n     -5,  4, -1\n     -2, 18, -3\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 20\n\n5. **Form the New Matrix:**\n   - Arrange the maximum values in a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     16, 20, 20\n     18, 20, 20\n     18, 20, 20\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, the result of max pooling, is:\n```\n<<<16, 20, 20>, <18, 20, 20>, <18, 20, 20>>>\n```"
