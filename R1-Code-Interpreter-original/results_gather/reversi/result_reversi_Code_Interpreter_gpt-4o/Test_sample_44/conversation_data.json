    "\nassistant > To determine the game situation after the given rounds, we need to simulate the moves and apply the flipping rules. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n* 0 1 *\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (1, 2)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (1, 2).\n- Check for any opponent's pieces (1) between two of your pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n\nAfter placing the piece at (1, 2), the board looks like this:\n```\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\n- No pieces are flipped in this round as there are no white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0).\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (1, 3)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (1, 3).\n- Check for any opponent's pieces (0) between two of the opponent's pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n\nAfter placing the piece at (1, 3), the board looks like this:\n```\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\n- No pieces are flipped in this round as there are no black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1).\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (3, 4)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (3, 4).\n- Check for any opponent's pieces (1) between two of your pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n\nAfter placing the piece at (3, 4), the board looks like this:\n```\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\n- No pieces are flipped in this round as there are no white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0).\n\n### Final Board State:\n```\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\nNow, let's represent this board state in the required format: <<<*,0,1,1,*,0,0,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*>>>"
