  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n0***\n*011\n*000\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,4)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (1,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "\nassistant > To determine the game situation after the specified rounds, we need to simulate the moves and apply the flipping rules. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n0 * * *\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (3,4)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (3,4).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- After placing at (3,4), the row becomes `* 0 0 0`, so no pieces are flipped.\n\n### Board State after Round 1:\n```\n0 * * *\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 0\n* * * 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (2,4)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (2,4).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- After placing at (2,4), the column becomes `* 1 0 0`, so no pieces are flipped.\n\n### Board State after Round 2:\n```\n0 * * *\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 0\n* * * 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (1,1)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (1,1).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- After placing at (1,1), the diagonal becomes `0 0 0 0`, so the piece at (2,2) is flipped from 1 to 0.\n\n### Final Board State after Round 3:\n```\n0 0 * *\n* 0 0 1\n* 0 0 0\n* * * 0\n```\n\nNow, let's represent this final board state in the required format: `<<<0,0,*,*,*,0,0,1,*,0,0,0,*,*,*,0>>>`."
