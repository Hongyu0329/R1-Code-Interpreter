    "\nassistant > To determine the game situation after the given rounds, we need to simulate the moves and apply the flipping rules. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n1 * * *\n0 1 0 *\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 *\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (2, 1)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2, 1).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n\nAfter placing the piece at (2, 1), the board looks like this:\n```\n1 * * *\n0 1 0 *\n0 0 0 *\n* * 0 *\n```\n\n- In the second row, the white piece at (2, 2) is between two black pieces (2, 1) and (2, 3), so it gets flipped to black (0).\n\n### Board after Round 1:\n```\n1 * * *\n0 0 0 *\n0 0 0 *\n* * 0 *\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (1, 1)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (1, 1).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n\nAfter placing the piece at (1, 1), the board looks like this:\n```\n1 1 * *\n0 0 0 *\n0 0 0 *\n* * 0 *\n```\n\n- In the first column, the black piece at (2, 1) is between two white pieces (1, 1) and (3, 1), so it gets flipped to white (1).\n\n### Board after Round 2:\n```\n1 1 * *\n1 0 0 *\n0 0 0 *\n* * 0 *\n```\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (4, 3)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (4, 3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n\nAfter placing the piece at (4, 3), the board looks like this:\n```\n1 1 * *\n1 0 0 *\n0 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\n- In the third column, the white piece at (2, 3) is between two black pieces (3, 3) and (4, 3), so it gets flipped to black (0).\n\n### Final Board after Round 3:\n```\n1 1 * *\n1 0 0 *\n0 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\nNow, let's represent this board as a list of characters, where `*` represents an empty space, `0` represents a black piece, and `1` represents a white piece.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Final board state after all rounds\nfinal_board = [\n    [1, 1, '*', '*'],\n    [1, 0, 0, '*'],\n    [0, 0, 0, '*'],\n    ['*', '*', 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert the board to a single list of characters\nfinal_board_flat = [str(cell) for row in final_board for cell in row]\nfinal_board_flat\nassistant > The final board state after all the rounds is represented as:\n\n```\n1 1 * *\n1 0 0 *\n0 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\nIn a single list format, it is represented as:\n\n<<<1,1,*,*,1,0,0,*,0,0,0,*,*,*,0,0>>>"
