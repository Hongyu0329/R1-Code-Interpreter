    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the game board and apply the rules of the game step by step. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   The board is a 6x6 grid, and the initial setup is given as:\n   ```\n   ******\n   **01**\n   **01**\n   **01**\n   ******\n   ******\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1: Your Move (Black)**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (2,3).\n   - The board after your move:\n     ```\n     ******\n     **001*\n     **01**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - In row 2, between the new black piece at (2,3) and the existing black piece at (2,2), there is one white piece at (2,4). This white piece is flipped to black.\n     - The board after flipping:\n       ```\n       ******\n       **000*\n       **01**\n       **01**\n       ******\n       ******\n       ```\n\n3. **Round 2: Opponent's Move (White)**\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (2,4).\n   - The board after the opponent's move:\n     ```\n     ******\n     **0001\n     **01**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - In row 2, between the new white piece at (2,4) and the existing white piece at (2,5), there are no black pieces to flip.\n     - In column 4, between the new white piece at (2,4) and the existing white piece at (3,4), there are no black pieces to flip.\n     - In the diagonal from (2,4) to (3,3), there are no black pieces to flip.\n     - No pieces are flipped in this round.\n\n4. **Final Board State:**\n   After both rounds, the board looks like this:\n   ```\n   ******\n   **0001\n   **01**\n   **01**\n   ******\n   ******\n   ```\n\nThe final answer, representing the board state after the opponent's move, is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,0,0,0,1,*,*,0,1,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
