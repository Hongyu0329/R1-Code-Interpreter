  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=6, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n******\n**01**\n**01**\n**01**\n******\n******\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 6x6.\n   - The initial configuration is:\n     ```\n     ******\n     **01**\n     **01**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1 (Your Move as Black)**:\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (2,3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     ******\n     **001*\n     **01**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - In row 2, between the new black piece at (2,3) and the existing black piece at (2,2), there is one white piece at (2,4). This white piece is flipped to black.\n     - The grid after flipping:\n       ```\n       ******\n       **000*\n       **01**\n       **01**\n       ******\n       ******\n       ```\n\n3. **Round 2 (Opponent's Move as White)**:\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (2,4).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     ******\n     **0001\n     **01**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - In row 2, between the new white piece at (2,4) and the existing white piece at (2,5), there are no black pieces to flip.\n     - In column 4, between the new white piece at (2,4) and the existing white piece at (3,4), there are no black pieces to flip.\n     - In the diagonal from (1,3) to (3,5), there are no black pieces to flip.\n     - No flips occur in this move.\n\n4. **Final Grid Configuration**:\n   - After both rounds, the grid is:\n     ```\n     ******\n     **0001\n     **01**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, representing the grid after the opponent's move, is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,0,0,0,1,*,*,0,1,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
