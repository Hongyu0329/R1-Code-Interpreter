  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*10*\n*000\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation after the move, we need to follow the rules of the game and apply them to the given board state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Board State:**\n   ```\n   ****\n   *10*\n   *000\n   ****\n   ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You are playing black, represented by 0.\n   - You place a black piece at position (3,4).\n\n3. **Board State After Placing the Piece:**\n   ```\n   ****\n   *10*\n   *0000\n   ****\n   ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - After placing the piece, we need to check if there are any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - **Row 3:** The row now reads `0000`. There are no white pieces between black pieces in this row.\n   - **Column 4:** The column reads `**0*`. There are no white pieces between black pieces in this column.\n   - **Diagonals:** \n     - The diagonal from (2,3) to (3,4) reads `10`. There is a white piece (1) between two black pieces (0), so it will be flipped to black (0).\n\n5. **Final Board State:**\n   - After flipping the white piece on the diagonal, the board becomes:\n   ```\n   ****\n   *00*\n   *0000\n   ****\n   ```\n\nThe final board state after your move is:\n```\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,0,0,*,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*>>>\n```"
