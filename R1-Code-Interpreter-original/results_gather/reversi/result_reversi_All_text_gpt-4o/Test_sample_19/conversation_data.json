  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*10*\n*000\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation and determine the game state after the move, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Board State:**\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 0 0\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You are playing black, represented by 0.\n   - You place a black piece at position (3,4).\n\n3. **Board State After Placing the Piece:**\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 0 0 0\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - Check all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) from the newly placed piece to see if any white pieces (1) are between two black pieces (0).\n   - **Horizontal Check (Row 3):**\n     - The row is now `0 0 0 0`. There are no white pieces between black pieces, so no flipping occurs.\n   - **Vertical Check (Column 4):**\n     - The column is `* * 0 *`. There are no white pieces between black pieces, so no flipping occurs.\n   - **Diagonal Checks:**\n     - Diagonal from (3,4) to (1,2): The diagonal is `* 1 0`. The white piece at (2,3) is between black pieces at (3,4) and (1,2), so it gets flipped to black.\n     - Other diagonals do not contain any white pieces between black pieces.\n\n5. **Final Board State After Flipping:**\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 0 0 0\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\nThe final board state after your move and flipping the necessary pieces is:\n\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,0,0,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*>>>"
