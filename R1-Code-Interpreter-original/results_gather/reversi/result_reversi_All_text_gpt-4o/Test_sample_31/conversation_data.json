    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - The initial configuration is:\n     ```\n     1 * * *\n     0 1 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (2,1):**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (2,1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     1 * * *\n     0 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 2: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n     - Column 1: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n     - Diagonals: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n\n3. **Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (1,1):**\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (1,1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     1 1 * *\n     0 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 1: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n     - Column 1: The black piece at (2,1) is between two white pieces (at (1,1) and (3,1)), so it flips to white.\n     - Diagonals: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n\n4. **Final Grid After Round 2:**\n   - After flipping the piece at (2,1), the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     1 1 * *\n     1 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the game situation after this round is:\n<<<1,1,*,*,1,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
