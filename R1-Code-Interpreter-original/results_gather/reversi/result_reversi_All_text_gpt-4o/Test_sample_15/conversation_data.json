  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n000*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation and determine the game state after the move, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - The initial state of the grid is:\n     ```\n     ****\n     000*\n     *01*\n     ****\n     ```\n   - You are playing as black, represented by 0.\n\n2. **Identify the Move:**\n   - Your move is to place a black piece at position (2,1).\n\n3. **Update the Grid with the New Move:**\n   - Place a black piece (0) at (2,1):\n     ```\n     ****\n     000*\n     *01*\n     ****\n     ```\n   - After placing the piece, the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     ****\n     000*\n     *01*\n     ****\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Flips:**\n   - We need to check if any white pieces (1) are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal, and flip them if so.\n\n5. **Analyze Rows, Columns, and Diagonals:**\n   - **Row 2:** The row is now 0000. There are no white pieces to flip.\n   - **Column 1:** The column is now *0**. There are no white pieces to flip.\n   - **Diagonals:** \n     - The diagonal from (1,1) to (4,4) is *0**. There are no white pieces to flip.\n     - The diagonal from (1,4) to (4,1) is ***0. There are no white pieces to flip.\n\n6. **Final Grid State:**\n   - After placing the piece and checking for flips, the grid remains:\n     ```\n     ****\n     0000\n     *01*\n     ****\n     ```\n\n7. **Output the Final Grid:**\n   - Convert the grid to the required format:\n     ```\n     <<<*,*,*,*,0,0,0,0,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is: <<<*,*,*,*,0,0,0,0,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
