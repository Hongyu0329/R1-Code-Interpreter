  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n*0**\n*00*\n*01*\n**01\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (4,4)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (1,2)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the game step by step, considering the rules of flipping the opponent's pieces when they are between two of the player's pieces.\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\nThe board is a 4x4 grid, and the initial setup is given as follows:\n\n```\n* 0 * *\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 1 *\n* * 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (4,3)\n- Place a black piece (0) at position (4,3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- In this case, placing a black piece at (4,3) does not result in any flips because there are no white pieces between two black pieces in any direction.\n\nThe board after Round 1:\n\n```\n* 0 * *\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 1 *\n* * 0 1\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (4,4)\n- Place a white piece (1) at position (4,4).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- Placing a white piece at (4,4) results in flipping the black piece at (4,3) to white because there is a black piece between two white pieces in the row (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nThe board after Round 2:\n\n```\n* 0 * *\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 1 *\n* * 1 1\n```\n\n### Round 3: Your Move (Black) at (1,2)\n- Place a black piece (0) at position (1,2).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- Placing a black piece at (1,2) results in flipping the white piece at (2,2) to black because there is a white piece between two black pieces in the column (1,2) and (3,2).\n\nThe board after Round 3:\n\n```\n* 0 * *\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 1 *\n* * 1 1\n```\n\n### Final Board Situation:\nAfter analyzing each round and applying the rules, the final board situation is:\n\n```\n* 0 * *\n* 0 0 *\n* 0 1 *\n* * 1 1\n```\n\nRepresenting this board in the required format:\n\n<<<*,0,*,*,*,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,1,1>>>"
