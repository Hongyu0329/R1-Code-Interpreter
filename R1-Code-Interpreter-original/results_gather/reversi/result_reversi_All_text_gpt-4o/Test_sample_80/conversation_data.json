  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=6, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n******\n*1****\n*010**\n**000*\n******\n******\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,2)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,2)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (4,5)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, we need to follow the rules of the game and apply them to each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n******\n*1****\n*010**\n**000*\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your (Black) landing position is (3,2)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (3,2).\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 3: Placing at (3,2) creates a sequence 0-1-0. The piece at (3,3) is flipped from 1 to 0.\n  - Column 2: No flips as there are no sequences formed.\n  - Diagonals: No flips as there are no sequences formed.\n\nUpdated Board after Round 1:\n```\n******\n*1****\n*000**\n**000*\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's (White) landing position is (2,2)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (2,2).\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 2: No flips as there are no sequences formed.\n  - Column 2: Placing at (2,2) creates a sequence 1-0-0. The piece at (3,2) is flipped from 0 to 1.\n  - Diagonals: No flips as there are no sequences formed.\n\nUpdated Board after Round 2:\n```\n******\n*11***\n*010**\n**000*\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 3: Your (Black) landing position is (4,5)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (4,5).\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 4: No flips as there are no sequences formed.\n  - Column 5: No flips as there are no sequences formed.\n  - Diagonals: Placing at (4,5) creates a diagonal sequence 0-1-0. The piece at (3,4) is flipped from 1 to 0.\n\nFinal Board after Round 3:\n```\n******\n*11***\n*0100*\n**0000\n******\n******\n```\n\nThe final game situation after this round is:\n`<<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,1,1,*,*,*,*,0,1,0,0,*,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>>`"
