  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally.

Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=6, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n******\n**000*\n**00**\n**01**\n******\n******\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (2,5)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, we need to follow the rules of the game and apply them to the given grid after each move. Let's break down each round:\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n******\n**000*\n**00**\n**01**\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (2,3)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2,3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (2,3), the grid becomes:\n  ```\n  ******\n  **000*\n  **00**\n  **01**\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n- No white pieces are between two black pieces, so no flipping occurs.\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (2,4)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (2,4).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (2,4), the grid becomes:\n  ```\n  ******\n  **000*\n  **010*\n  **01**\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n- No black pieces are between two white pieces, so no flipping occurs.\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (2,5)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2,5).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (2,5), the grid becomes:\n  ```\n  ******\n  **000*\n  **0100\n  **01**\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n- In row 2, there is a white piece at (2,4) between black pieces at (2,3) and (2,5). Therefore, the white piece at (2,4) is flipped to black.\n- The final grid after flipping is:\n  ```\n  ******\n  **000*\n  **0000\n  **01**\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n\nThe game situation after this round is:\n```\n******\n**000*\n**0000\n**01**\n******\n******\n```"
