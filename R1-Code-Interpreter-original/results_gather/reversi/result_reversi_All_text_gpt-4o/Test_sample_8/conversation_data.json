Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*10*\n*00*\n**0*\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,3)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation and determine the game state after the move, we need to follow the rules of the game and apply them to the given board configuration. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Configuration:**\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * * 0 *\n   ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You are playing black, represented by 0.\n   - You place a black piece at position (4,3).\n\n3. **Board After Placing the Piece:**\n   - The board now looks like this:\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * * 0 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - We need to check if there are any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal, and flip them.\n\n   - **Row Check:**\n     - Row 4: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n   - **Column Check:**\n     - Column 3: The sequence is 0 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 0 (row 4). No white pieces to flip.\n\n   - **Diagonal Check:**\n     - Diagonal from (2,2) to (4,4): The sequence is 1 (row 2, col 2), 0 (row 3, col 3), 0 (row 4, col 4). The white piece at (2,2) is between two black pieces, so it will be flipped to black.\n\n5. **Final Board Configuration:**\n   - After flipping the white piece at (2,2), the board becomes:\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * * 0 0\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the game situation after this round is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,*,0,0>>>"
