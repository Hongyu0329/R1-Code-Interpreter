    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the moves and their effects on the board:\n\n1. **Initial Board State:**\n   ```\n   ****\n   *111\n   *000\n   ****\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (3,4):**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (3,4).\n   - The board now looks like this:\n     ```\n     ****\n     *111\n     *0000\n     ****\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 3: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n     - Column 4: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n     - Diagonals: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n\n3. **Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (2,4):**\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (2,4).\n   - The board now looks like this:\n     ```\n     ****\n     *1111\n     *0000\n     ****\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 2: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n     - Column 4: The white piece at (2,4) and the white piece at (1,4) surround the black piece at (3,4), so the black piece at (3,4) is flipped to white.\n     - Diagonals: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n\n4. **Final Board State after Round 2:**\n   ```\n   ****\n   *1111\n   *0011\n   ****\n   ```\n\nThe final board state after the opponent's move is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,1,1,1,1,*,0,0,1,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
