    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - The initial configuration is:\n     ```\n     * 0 * *\n     * 0 0 *\n     1 1 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1 (Your Move as Black):**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (1,2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     1 1 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - No flips occur because there are no white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in any row, column, or diagonal.\n\n3. **Round 2 (Opponent's Move as White):**\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (3,1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     1 1 1 *\n     1 * * *\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - In the column (1,1) to (3,1), there is a black piece (0) at (2,1) between two white pieces (1) at (1,1) and (3,1). Therefore, the black piece at (2,1) is flipped to white (1).\n\n4. **Final Grid Configuration:**\n   - After the opponent's move and the flip, the grid is:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     1 0 0 *\n     1 1 1 *\n     1 * * *\n     ```\n\nThe final game situation after this round is represented as:\n<<<*,0,0,*,1,0,0,*,1,1,1,*,1,*,*,*>>>"
