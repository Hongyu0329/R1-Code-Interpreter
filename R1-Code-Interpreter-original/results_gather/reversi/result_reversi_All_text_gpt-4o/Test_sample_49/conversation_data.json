    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's go through each round and apply the rules of the game:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n* * 0 *\n* 1 0 1\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 *\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (4,3)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (4,3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- In this case, placing a black piece at (4,3) does not result in any flips because there are no white pieces between two black pieces in any direction.\n\nBoard after Round 1:\n```\n* * 0 *\n* 1 0 1\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (2,4)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (2,4).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- Placing a white piece at (2,4) results in flipping the black piece at (2,3) because it is between two white pieces (1) in the row.\n\nBoard after Round 2:\n```\n* * 0 *\n* 1 1 1\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\n### Round 3: Your Move (Black) at (1,3)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (1,3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- Placing a black piece at (1,3) results in flipping the white piece at (2,3) because it is between two black pieces (0) in the column.\n\nFinal Board after Round 3:\n```\n* * 0 0\n* 1 0 1\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\nThe final game situation after Round 3 is:\n<<<*,*,0,0,*,1,0,1,*,0,0,*,*,*,0,0>>>"
