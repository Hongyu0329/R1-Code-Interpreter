    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the moves and their effects on the board:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n******\n******\n**111*\n**000*\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (4,5)\n- You place a black piece (0) at position (4,5).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- In row 4, placing a black piece at (4,5) results in the sequence **0000*.\n- The white piece at (4,3) is between two black pieces (4,2) and (4,5), so it is flipped to black.\n- The board after your move:\n  ```\n  ******\n  ******\n  **111*\n  **0000\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (3,5)\n- The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (3,5).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) that are between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- In column 5, placing a white piece at (3,5) results in the sequence **1*0*.\n- The black piece at (4,5) is between two white pieces (3,5) and (5,5), so it is flipped to white.\n- The board after the opponent's move:\n  ```\n  ******\n  ******\n  **1111\n  **0010\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n\n### Final Board State:\nAfter both rounds, the board looks like this:\n```\n******\n******\n**1111\n**0010\n******\n******\n```\n\nThe final answer, representing the board state after the opponent's move, is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,1,1,1,1,*,*,0,0,1,0,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
