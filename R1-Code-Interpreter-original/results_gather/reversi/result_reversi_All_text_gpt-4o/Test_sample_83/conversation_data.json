    "To analyze the game situation step by step, we need to follow the rules of the game and apply them to each move. Let's break down each round:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n******\n****0*\n**101*\n**00**\n***0**\n******\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (5,4)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (5,4).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- In this case, placing a black piece at (5,4) does not result in any flips because there are no white pieces between two black pieces in any direction.\n\nBoard after Round 1:\n```\n******\n****0*\n**101*\n**00**\n**00**\n******\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (3,5)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (3,5).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- Placing a white piece at (3,5) results in flipping the black piece at (3,4) because it is between the white pieces at (3,3) and (3,5).\n\nBoard after Round 2:\n```\n******\n****0*\n**111*\n**00**\n**00**\n******\n```\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (2,5)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2,5).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- Placing a black piece at (2,5) results in flipping the white piece at (3,5) because it is between the black pieces at (2,5) and (4,5).\n\nFinal Board after Round 3:\n```\n******\n****0*\n**101*\n**100*\n**00**\n******\n```\n\nThe final game situation after Round 3 is:\n```\n******\n****0*\n**101*\n**100*\n**00**\n******\n```"
