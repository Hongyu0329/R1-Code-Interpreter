    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the game board and apply the rules of the game to determine the outcome after the black piece is placed at position (2,1).\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   ****\n   000*\n   *01*\n   ****\n   ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You are playing black, represented by 0.\n   - You place a black piece at position (2,1).\n\n3. **Board After Placing the Piece:**\n   - The board now looks like this:\n   ```\n   ****\n   000*\n   001*\n   ****\n   ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - We need to check if there are any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - **Row 2:** The row is now `0000`. There are no white pieces between black pieces in this row.\n   - **Column 1:** The column is now `*0*`. There are no white pieces between black pieces in this column.\n   - **Diagonals:** \n     - The diagonal from (2,1) to (3,2) is `00`. There are no white pieces between black pieces in this diagonal.\n     - The diagonal from (2,1) to (1,2) is `0*`. There are no white pieces between black pieces in this diagonal.\n\n5. **Final Board State:**\n   - Since no white pieces are between two black pieces in any row, column, or diagonal, no pieces are flipped.\n   - The final board state after your move is:\n   ```\n   ****\n   000*\n   001*\n   ****\n   ```\n\n6. **Output the Board:**\n   - The board is represented as a single string with each cell separated by a comma.\n   - The final output is: `*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,0,0,1,*,*,*,*,*`\n\nAnswer: `*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,0,0,1,*,*,*,*,*`"
