  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n*0**\n*00*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (1,2)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - The initial setup from the previous round is:\n     ```\n     * 0 * *\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You are playing black, represented by 0.\n   - Your move is to place a black piece at position (1,2).\n\n3. **Placing the Piece:**\n   - Place a black piece (0) at (1,2):\n     ```\n     * 0 * *\n     0 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - After placing the piece, check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Check each direction from the newly placed piece at (1,2):\n\n   **Row Check:**\n   - Row 1: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n   **Column Check:**\n   - Column 2: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n   **Diagonal Check:**\n   - Diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: No white pieces between black pieces.\n   - Diagonal from top-right to bottom-left: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n5. **Final Grid After the Move:**\n   - Since no white pieces are between two black pieces in any direction, no pieces are flipped.\n   - The grid remains:\n     ```\n     * 0 * *\n     0 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n6. **Output the Grid:**\n   - Convert the grid to the required format:\n     ```\n     <<<*,0,*,*,0,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is: <<<*,0,*,*,0,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
