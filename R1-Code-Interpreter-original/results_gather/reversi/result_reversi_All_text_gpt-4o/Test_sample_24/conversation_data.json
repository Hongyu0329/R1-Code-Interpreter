  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*111\n*00*\n**0*\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   - The board is a 4x4 grid.\n   - The initial setup from the previous round is:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 1 1\n     * 0 0 *\n     * * 0 *\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (4,3):**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (4,3).\n   - The board now looks like this:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 1 1\n     * 0 0 *\n     * * 0 0\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - No flips occur in the row or column.\n     - Diagonal check: From (4,3) to (2,1), there are no opponent's pieces to flip.\n     - Diagonal check: From (4,3) to (2,5) (out of bounds), no flips.\n\n3. **Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (2,4):**\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (2,4).\n   - The board now looks like this:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 1 1\n     * 0 0 1\n     * * 0 0\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 2: No flips as there are no black pieces on either side of the white piece.\n     - Column 4: No flips as there are no black pieces on either side of the white piece.\n     - Diagonal check: From (2,4) to (4,2), there is a black piece at (3,3) between them, so it flips to white.\n     - Diagonal check: From (2,4) to (0,6) (out of bounds), no flips.\n\n4. **Final Board After Round 2:**\n   - After flipping the piece at (3,3) from black to white, the final board is:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 1 1\n     * 0 1 1\n     * * 0 0\n     ```\n\nThe final game situation after this round is: <<<*,*,*,*,*,1,1,1,*,0,1,1,*,*,0,0>>>"
