    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   The board is a 6x6 grid with the following configuration:\n   ```\n   ******\n   ******\n   **111*\n   **00**\n   ***0**\n   ******\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (5,4):**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (5,4).\n   - Check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - In this case, placing a black piece at (5,4) does not result in any flips because there are no white pieces between two black pieces in any direction.\n\n   The board after your move:\n   ```\n   ******\n   ******\n   **111*\n   **00**\n   **00**\n   ******\n   ```\n\n3. **Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (3,5):**\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (3,5).\n   - Check for any black pieces (0) that are between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Placing a white piece at (3,5) results in the following flips:\n     - In the vertical direction (column 5), the black piece at (4,5) is between the white pieces at (3,5) and (5,5). Therefore, the black piece at (4,5) is flipped to white.\n\n   The board after the opponent's move:\n   ```\n   ******\n   ******\n   **111*\n   **011*\n   **00**\n   ******\n   ```\n\nThe final board configuration after both rounds is:\n```\n******\n******\n**111*\n**011*\n**00**\n******\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,1,1,1,*,*,*,0,1,1,*,*,0,0,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
