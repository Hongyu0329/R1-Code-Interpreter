  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*10*\n*01*\n**01\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (4,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - The initial configuration is:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * 0 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1 (Your Move - Black at (4,3))**:\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (4,3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * 0 0\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - **Row 4**: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n     - **Column 3**: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n     - **Diagonals**: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n\n3. **Round 2 (Opponent's Move - White at (4,4))**:\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (4,4).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * 0 1\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - **Row 4**: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n     - **Column 4**: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n     - **Diagonals**: \n       - The diagonal from (2,2) to (4,4) has a black piece (0) at (3,3) between two white pieces (1) at (2,2) and (4,4). Therefore, the black piece at (3,3) is flipped to white (1).\n\n4. **Final Grid Configuration**:\n   - After the opponent's move and the flip, the grid is:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * 0 1\n     ```\n\nThe final game situation after this round is: <<<*,*,*,*,*,1,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,0,1>>>"
