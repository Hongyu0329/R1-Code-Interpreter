    "To analyze the game situation step by step, we need to follow the rules of the game and apply them to each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n**1*\n001*\n*00*\n***0\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (2,1)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2,1).\n- Check for any opponent's pieces (1) between two of your pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (2,1), the board looks like this:\n  ```\n  **1*\n  001*\n  *00*\n  ***0\n  ```\n- No opponent's pieces are between two of your pieces in any row, column, or diagonal, so no pieces are flipped.\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (1,3)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (1,3).\n- Check for any of your pieces (0) between two of the opponent's pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (1,3), the board looks like this:\n  ```\n  **11\n  001*\n  *00*\n  ***0\n  ```\n- No black pieces are between two white pieces in any row, column, or diagonal, so no pieces are flipped.\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (4,4)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (4,4).\n- Check for any opponent's pieces (1) between two of your pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (4,4), the board looks like this:\n  ```\n  **11\n  001*\n  *00*\n  ***0\n  ```\n- No white pieces are between two black pieces in any row, column, or diagonal, so no pieces are flipped.\n\n### Final Board State:\n```\n**11\n001*\n*00*\n***0\n```\n\nThe game situation after this round is:\n<<<*,*,1,1,0,0,1,*,*,0,0,*,*,*,*,0>>>"
