  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n*0**\n*00*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (1,2)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation and determine the game state after your move, let's follow the rules and steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid State:**\n   ```\n   * 0 * *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You are playing black, represented by 0.\n   - Your move is to place a black piece at position (1,2).\n\n3. **Placing the Piece:**\n   - Place a black piece (0) at (1,2).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - Check all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) from the newly placed piece to see if any of the opponent's pieces (1) are between two of your pieces (0).\n   - **Horizontal Check:**\n     - Row 1: No opponent's pieces between two black pieces.\n   - **Vertical Check:**\n     - Column 2: No opponent's pieces between two black pieces.\n   - **Diagonal Check:**\n     - Diagonal from (1,2) to (3,4): No opponent's pieces between two black pieces.\n     - Diagonal from (1,2) to (3,0): No opponent's pieces between two black pieces.\n\n5. **Final Grid State:**\n   - Since no opponent's pieces are between two of your pieces in any direction, no pieces are flipped.\n   - The final grid state after your move is:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the game situation after your move is represented as:\n<<<*,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
