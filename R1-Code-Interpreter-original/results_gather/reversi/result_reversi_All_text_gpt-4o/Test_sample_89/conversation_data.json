    "To analyze the game situation step by step, we need to follow the rules of the game and apply them to each round. Let's break down each round:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n******\n***0**\n**101*\n**000*\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (4,5)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (4,5).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- In row 4, placing a black piece at (4,5) results in the sequence **0000**. No white pieces to flip.\n- In column 5, the sequence becomes **0** at (3,5) and **0** at (4,5). No white pieces to flip.\n- In the diagonal from (2,3) to (5,6), the sequence is **1010**. The white piece at (3,4) is between two black pieces, so it flips to black (0).\n\nUpdated Board after Round 1:\n```\n******\n***0**\n**100*\n**0000\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (3,5)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (3,5).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- In row 3, the sequence is **1001**. The black piece at (3,4) is between two white pieces, so it flips to white (1).\n- In column 5, the sequence is **01** at (3,5) and **0** at (4,5). No black pieces to flip.\n- In the diagonal from (1,3) to (5,7), the sequence is **101**. No black pieces to flip.\n\nUpdated Board after Round 2:\n```\n******\n***0**\n**111*\n**0000\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (2,4)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2,4).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- In row 2, the sequence is **100**. The white piece at (2,3) is between two black pieces, so it flips to black (0).\n- In column 4, the sequence is **010**. The white piece at (3,4) is between two black pieces, so it flips to black (0).\n- In the diagonal from (1,3) to (4,6), the sequence is **1000**. The white piece at (2,3) is already flipped, so no additional flips are needed.\n\nFinal Board after Round 3:\n```\n******\n***0**\n**000*\n**0000\n******\n******\n```\n\nThe final game situation after Round 3 is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,0,*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,*,*,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
