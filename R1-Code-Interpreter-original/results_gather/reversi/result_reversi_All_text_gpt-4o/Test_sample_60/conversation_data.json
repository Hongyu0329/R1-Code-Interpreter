    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 6x6.\n   - The initial configuration is:\n     ```\n     ******\n     ******\n     **10**\n     **010*\n     ****1*\n     ******\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1 (Your Move - Black at (4,5))**:\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (4,5).\n   - After placing the piece, check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - In this case, placing a black piece at (4,5) does not result in any flips because there are no white pieces between two black pieces in any direction.\n   - The grid after your move:\n     ```\n     ******\n     ******\n     **10**\n     **0100\n     ****1*\n     ******\n     ```\n\n3. **Round 2 (Opponent's Move - White at (5,5))**:\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (5,5).\n   - After placing the piece, check for any black pieces (0) that are between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Placing a white piece at (5,5) results in flipping the black piece at (4,5) to white because it is between the white pieces at (3,5) and (5,5) in the same column.\n   - The grid after the opponent's move:\n     ```\n     ******\n     ******\n     **10**\n     **0110\n     ****11\n     ******\n     ```\n\nThe final game situation after both rounds is:\n```\n******\n******\n**10**\n**0110\n****11\n******\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,1,0,*,*,0,1,1,0,*,*,*,*,1,1,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
