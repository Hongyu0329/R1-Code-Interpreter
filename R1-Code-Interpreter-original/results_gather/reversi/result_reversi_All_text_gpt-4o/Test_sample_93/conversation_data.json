    "To analyze the game situation step by step, we need to follow the rules of the game and apply them to the given grid after each move. Let's break down each round:\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n******\n000***\n**10**\n**01**\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (2,3)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2,3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- In row 2, placing a black piece at (2,3) results in the sequence 0, 0, 0, which does not require any flipping.\n- The grid after Round 1:\n  ```\n  ******\n  0000**\n  **10**\n  **01**\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (2,2)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (2,2).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- In row 2, placing a white piece at (2,2) results in the sequence 0, 1, 0, which requires flipping the black piece at (2,3) to white.\n- The grid after Round 2:\n  ```\n  ******\n  0101**\n  **10**\n  **01**\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (2,1)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2,1).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal to flip them.\n- In row 2, placing a black piece at (2,1) results in the sequence 0, 1, 0, which requires flipping the white piece at (2,2) to black.\n- The grid after Round 3:\n  ```\n  ******\n  0001**\n  **10**\n  **01**\n  ******\n  ******\n  ```\n\nThe final game situation after Round 3 is:\n```\n******\n0001**\n**10**\n**01**\n******\n******\n```"
