  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*10*\n*000\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation and determine the game state after the move, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Board State:**\n   - The board is a 4x4 grid.\n   - The current state of the board is:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 0 0\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Move:**\n   - You are playing black (0).\n   - Your move is to place a black piece at position (3,4).\n\n3. **Update the Board with the New Move:**\n   - Place a black piece (0) at position (3,4):\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 0 0 0\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply the Flipping Rules:**\n   - Check all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) from the new piece at (3,4) to see if any white pieces (1) are between two black pieces (0) and need to be flipped.\n\n   - **Horizontal Check (Row 3):**\n     - The row is now: `0 0 0 0`\n     - No white pieces to flip in this row.\n\n   - **Vertical Check (Column 4):**\n     - The column is: `* * 0 *`\n     - No white pieces to flip in this column.\n\n   - **Diagonal Checks:**\n     - Diagonal from top-left to bottom-right (\\\\): \n       - The diagonal is: `* 0 0`\n       - No white pieces to flip in this diagonal.\n     - Diagonal from top-right to bottom-left (/):\n       - The diagonal is: `* 0 *`\n       - No white pieces to flip in this diagonal.\n\n5. **Final Board State:**\n   - After placing the piece and applying the flipping rules, the board remains:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 0 0 0\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n6. **Convert the Board to the Required Output Format:**\n   - The board in the required format is:\n     <<<*,*,*,*,*,1,0,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*>>>\n\nTherefore, the game situation after this round is: <<<*,*,*,*,*,1,0,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*>>>"
