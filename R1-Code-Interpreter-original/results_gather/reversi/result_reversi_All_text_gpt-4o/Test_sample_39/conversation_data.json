  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*111\n*000\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,4)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the moves and their effects on the board:\n\n1. **Initial Board State:**\n   ```\n   ****\n   *111\n   *000\n   ****\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (3,4):**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (3,4).\n   - The board now looks like this:\n     ```\n     ****\n     *111\n     *0000\n     ****\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 3: The sequence is now 0000, so no flips occur.\n     - Column 4: The sequence is 1, 0, 0, 0. The 1 at (2,4) is between two 0s (at (1,4) and (3,4)), so it flips to 0.\n     - Diagonals: No diagonal flips occur as there are no sequences of opponent's pieces between two of your pieces.\n\n   - Updated board after flips:\n     ```\n     ****\n     *110\n     *0000\n     ****\n     ```\n\n3. **Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (2,4):**\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (2,4).\n   - The board now looks like this:\n     ```\n     ****\n     *111\n     *0000\n     ****\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 2: The sequence is 111, so no flips occur.\n     - Column 4: The sequence is 1, 1, 0, 0. The 0s at (3,4) and (4,4) are between two 1s (at (2,4) and (1,4)), so they flip to 1.\n     - Diagonals: No diagonal flips occur as there are no sequences of opponent's pieces between two of their pieces.\n\n   - Updated board after flips:\n     ```\n     ****\n     *111\n     *0111\n     ****\n     ```\n\nThe final board state after both rounds is:\n```\n****\n*111\n*0111\n****\n```\n\nRepresenting the board as a single string:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,1,1,1,*,0,1,1,1,*,*,*,*>>>"
