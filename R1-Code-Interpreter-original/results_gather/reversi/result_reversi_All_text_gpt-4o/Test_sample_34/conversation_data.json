  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n*0**\n*00*\n111*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (1,2)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (3,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - The initial configuration is:\n     ```\n     * 0 * *\n     * 0 0 *\n     1 1 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1 (Your Move as Black):**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (1,2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     1 1 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - In the first row, placing a 0 at (1,2) does not result in any flips because there are no 1s between two 0s.\n     - In the second row, there are no 1s between two 0s.\n     - In the third row, there are no 1s between two 0s.\n     - In the columns and diagonals, there are no 1s between two 0s.\n\n3. **Round 2 (Opponent's Move as White):**\n   - The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (3,1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     1 1 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - In the third row, placing a 1 at (3,1) does not result in any flips because there are no 0s between two 1s.\n     - In the first column, there are no 0s between two 1s.\n     - In the second column, there are no 0s between two 1s.\n     - In the third column, there are no 0s between two 1s.\n     - In the diagonals, there are no 0s between two 1s.\n\n4. **Final Grid Configuration:**\n   - After both rounds, the grid remains unchanged from the initial setup after your move:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     1 1 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the game situation after this round is represented as:\n<<<*,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,1,1,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
