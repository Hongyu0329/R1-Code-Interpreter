    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the game board and apply the rules of the game step by step for each round. Let's break it down:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\nThe board is a 4x4 grid, and the initial setup is given as:\n```\n1 * * *\n0 1 0 *\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 *\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (2,1)\n- You place a black piece (0) at position (2,1).\n- The board now looks like this:\n  ```\n  1 * * *\n  0 0 0 *\n  * 0 0 *\n  * * 0 *\n  ```\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 2: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n  - Column 1: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n  - Diagonals: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (1,1)\n- The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (1,1).\n- The board now looks like this:\n  ```\n  1 1 * *\n  0 0 0 *\n  * 0 0 *\n  * * 0 *\n  ```\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 1: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n  - Column 1: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n  - Diagonals: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n\n### Round 3: Your Move (Black) at (4,3)\n- You place a black piece (0) at position (4,3).\n- The board now looks like this:\n  ```\n  1 1 * *\n  0 0 0 *\n  * 0 0 *\n  * * 0 0\n  ```\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 4: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n  - Column 3: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n  - Diagonals:\n    - The diagonal from (1,1) to (4,4) has a white piece at (2,2) between black pieces at (1,1) and (4,3). So, the piece at (2,2) is flipped from 1 to 0.\n\nAfter flipping, the board looks like this:\n```\n1 1 * *\n0 0 0 *\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Board State:\nThe final board state after all rounds is:\n```\n1 1 * *\n0 0 0 *\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\nRepresenting the board as a single line with commas separating the elements, the final answer is:\n`<<<1,1,*,*,0,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,*,0,0>>>`"
