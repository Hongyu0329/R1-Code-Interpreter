    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The grid is 4x4, and the initial setup is given as:\n   ```\n   1 0 * *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1 (Your Move)**: You play black and place a piece at position (1,2).\n   - The grid after placing the black piece at (1,2) becomes:\n     ```\n     1 0 0 *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 1: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n     - Column 2: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n     - Diagonals: No flips, as there are no white pieces between two black pieces.\n\n3. **Round 2 (Opponent's Move)**: The opponent plays white and places a piece at position (1,1).\n   - The grid after placing the white piece at (1,1) becomes:\n     ```\n     1 1 0 *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 1: The black piece at (1,2) is between two white pieces (at (1,1) and (1,3)), so it is flipped to white.\n     - Column 1: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n     - Diagonals: No flips, as there are no black pieces between two white pieces.\n\n4. **Final Grid After Round 2**:\n   ```\n   1 1 1 *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\nThe final game situation after this round is represented as:\n<<<1,1,1,*,*,1,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
