    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the game board and apply the rules of the game to determine the outcome after the black piece is placed at position (2,1).\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   0 0 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n2. **Placing the Black Piece:**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (2,1).\n\n3. **Board After Placing the Piece:**\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   0 0 0 *\n   0 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - We need to check all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) from the newly placed piece to see if any white pieces (1) are between two black pieces (0) and flip them.\n\n   - **Horizontal Check (Row 2):**\n     - From (2,1) to (2,4): The row is `0 0 0 *`. There are no white pieces to flip.\n\n   - **Vertical Check (Column 1):**\n     - From (1,1) to (4,1): The column is `* 0 * *`. There are no white pieces to flip.\n\n   - **Diagonal Check:**\n     - Diagonal from (2,1) to (3,2): The diagonal is `0 0`. There are no white pieces to flip.\n     - Other diagonals do not contain the newly placed piece.\n\n5. **Final Board State:**\n   - After placing the piece and checking all possible flips, the board remains unchanged except for the newly placed piece.\n\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   0 0 0 *\n   0 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n6. **Output the Board:**\n   - Convert the board to the required format: <<<*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,0,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>\n\nThe final answer is: <<<*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,0,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
