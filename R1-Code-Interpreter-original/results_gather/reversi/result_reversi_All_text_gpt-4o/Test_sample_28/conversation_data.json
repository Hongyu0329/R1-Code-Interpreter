    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the moves and their effects on the board:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n****\n*111\n*00*\n**0*\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (4,3)\n- You place a black piece (0) at position (4,3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal:\n  - **Row 4**: No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - **Column 3**: No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - **Diagonals**: \n    - The diagonal from (3,2) to (4,3) has a white piece at (3,3) between black pieces at (3,2) and (4,3). Flip (3,3) from 1 to 0.\n\nThe board after your move:\n```\n****\n*111\n*000\n**00\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (2,4)\n- The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (2,4).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) that are between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal:\n  - **Row 2**: No black pieces between white pieces.\n  - **Column 4**: No black pieces between white pieces.\n  - **Diagonals**:\n    - The diagonal from (1,3) to (2,4) has a black piece at (1,4) between white pieces at (1,3) and (2,4). Flip (1,4) from 0 to 1.\n\nThe board after the opponent's move:\n```\n***1\n*111\n*000\n**00\n```\n\n### Final Board State:\n```\n***1\n*111\n*000\n**00\n```\n\nThe final answer, representing the board state after both rounds, is:\n<<<*,*,*,1,*,1,1,1,*,0,0,0,*,*,0,0>>>"
