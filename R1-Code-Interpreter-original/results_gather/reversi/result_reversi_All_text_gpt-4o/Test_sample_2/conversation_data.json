  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n*0**\n*00*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (1,2)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   The grid is a 4x4 matrix, and the initial setup from the previous round is:\n   ```\n   * 0 * *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   You are playing black, represented by 0. Your move is to place a black piece at position (1,2). The grid is 0-indexed, so this corresponds to the second row and third column in the grid.\n\n3. **Placing the Piece:**\n   After placing the black piece at (1,2), the grid looks like this:\n   ```\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - **Row Check:** \n     - In the second row, there are no white pieces between two black pieces, so no flipping occurs in this row.\n   - **Column Check:**\n     - In the third column, there is a white piece (1) at position (3,3) between two black pieces (0) at positions (1,3) and (3,3). Therefore, the white piece at (3,3) is flipped to black (0).\n   - **Diagonal Check:**\n     - There are no diagonals with white pieces between two black pieces, so no flipping occurs diagonally.\n\n5. **Final Grid After the Move:**\n   After flipping the necessary pieces, the final grid looks like this:\n   ```\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\nThe game situation after this round is represented as:\n<<<*,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
