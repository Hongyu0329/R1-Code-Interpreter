  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the game step by step, considering the rules of flipping the opponent's pieces when they are between two of the player's pieces.\n\n### Initial Setup:\nThe grid is 4x4, and the initial setup is given as:\n```\n****\n*10*\n*00*\n000*\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (4,3)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (4,3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- In row 4, placing a black piece at (4,3) results in:\n  - Row 4: 0000 (no white pieces to flip)\n- The grid after Round 1:\n  ```\n  ****\n  *10*\n  *00*\n  0000\n  ```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (4,2)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (4,2).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- In row 4, placing a white piece at (4,2) results in:\n  - Row 4: 0110 (black pieces at (4,1) and (4,3) are flipped to white)\n- The grid after Round 2:\n  ```\n  ****\n  *10*\n  *00*\n  0110\n  ```\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (4,1)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (4,1).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- In row 4, placing a black piece at (4,1) results in:\n  - Row 4: 0010 (white pieces at (4,2) are flipped to black)\n- The grid after Round 3:\n  ```\n  ****\n  *10*\n  *00*\n  0010\n  ```\n\n### Final Game Situation:\nAfter completing the three rounds, the final grid is:\n```\n****\n*10*\n*00*\n0010\n```\n\nThe final answer, representing the grid, is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,1,0,*,*,0,0,*,0,0,1,0>>>"
