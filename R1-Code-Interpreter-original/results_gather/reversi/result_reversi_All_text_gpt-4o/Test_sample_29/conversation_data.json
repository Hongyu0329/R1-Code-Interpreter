    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the moves and their effects on the board:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n****\n*111\n*00*\n**0*\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (4,3)\n- You place a black piece (0) at position (4,3).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal:\n  - **Row 4**: No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - **Column 3**: No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - **Diagonals**: \n    - Diagonal from (4,3) to (2,1): No white pieces between black pieces.\n    - Diagonal from (4,3) to (3,4): No white pieces between black pieces.\n- No pieces are flipped as a result of this move.\n\n### Board State After Round 1:\n```\n****\n*111\n*00*\n**00\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (2,4)\n- The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (2,4).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) that are between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal:\n  - **Row 2**: No black pieces between white pieces.\n  - **Column 4**: Black piece at (3,4) is between white pieces at (2,4) and (4,4). Flip the black piece at (3,4) to white.\n  - **Diagonals**: \n    - Diagonal from (2,4) to (4,2): No black pieces between white pieces.\n    - Diagonal from (2,4) to (1,3): No black pieces between white pieces.\n\n### Final Board State After Round 2:\n```\n****\n*111\n*010\n**01\n```\n\nThe final board state after both rounds is:\n```\n****\n*111\n*010\n**01\n```\n\nRepresenting this in the required format:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,1,1,1,*,0,1,0,*,*,0,1>>>"
