  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*10*\n*000\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4.\n   - The initial setup from the previous round is:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 0 0\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You are playing black (0).\n   - Your move is to place a black piece at position (3,4).\n\n3. **Grid After Your Move:**\n   - Place a black piece at (3,4):\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 1 0 *\n     * 0 0 0 0\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n4. **Flipping Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - Check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - **Row 3:** No white pieces to flip as there are no white pieces between black pieces in row 3.\n   - **Column 4:** No white pieces to flip as there are no white pieces between black pieces in column 4.\n   - **Diagonals:**\n     - Check the diagonal from (2,2) to (3,4): The sequence is 1, 0, 0. The white piece at (2,2) is between two black pieces, so it will be flipped to black.\n     - The other diagonals do not contain any white pieces between black pieces.\n\n5. **Final Grid After Flipping:**\n   - After flipping the white piece at (2,2), the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     * * * *\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 0 0\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\nThe final game situation after your move is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,0,0,*,0,0,0,0,*,*,*,*>>>"
