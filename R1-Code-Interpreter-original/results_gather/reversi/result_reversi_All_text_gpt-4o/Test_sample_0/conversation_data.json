    "To analyze the game situation after the move, we need to follow the rules of the game and determine which pieces will be flipped after placing a black piece at the given position (4,3).\n\n1. **Initial Board State:**\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * * 0 *\n   ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You place a black piece (0) at position (4,3).\n\n3. **Board State After Placing the Piece:**\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * * 0 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Flipping Process:**\n   - We need to check all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) from the newly placed piece to see if there are any white pieces (1) that are sandwiched between two black pieces (0).\n\n5. **Horizontal Check:**\n   - Row 4: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n6. **Vertical Check:**\n   - Column 3: The sequence is 0 (at 2,3), 0 (at 3,3), 0 (at 4,3). No white pieces to flip.\n\n7. **Diagonal Check:**\n   - Diagonal from (4,3) to (1,0): No white pieces to flip.\n   - Diagonal from (4,3) to (1,6): No white pieces to flip.\n   - Diagonal from (4,3) to (3,2): The sequence is 0 (at 3,2), 0 (at 4,3). No white pieces to flip.\n\n8. **Final Board State:**\n   - After checking all possible directions, no white pieces are flipped.\n\nThe final board state after your move is:\n```\n* * * *\n* 1 0 *\n* 0 0 *\n* * 0 0\n```\n\nRepresenting this in the required format:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,1,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,*,0,0>>>"
