  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n0***\n*011\n*000\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,4)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (1,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's go through each round and apply the rules of the game:\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n0 * * *\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your (Black) landing position is (3,4)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (3,4).\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 3: The sequence becomes `* 0 0 0 0`. The piece at (3,2) is between two black pieces (3,1) and (3,4), so it flips to black.\n  - Column 4: The sequence becomes `* 1 0`. The piece at (2,4) is between two black pieces (3,4) and (4,4), so it flips to black.\n  - Diagonals: No flips occur as there are no sequences of opponent's pieces between two of your pieces.\n\nUpdated Board:\n```\n0 * * *\n* 0 1 0\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's (White) landing position is (2,4)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (2,4).\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 2: The sequence becomes `* 0 1 1`. The piece at (2,3) is between two white pieces (2,2) and (2,4), so it flips to white.\n  - Column 4: The sequence becomes `* 1 0`. No flips occur as there are no sequences of black pieces between two white pieces.\n  - Diagonals: No flips occur as there are no sequences of black pieces between two white pieces.\n\nUpdated Board:\n```\n0 * * *\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\n### Round 3: Your (Black) landing position is (1,1)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (1,1).\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 1: The sequence becomes `0 * * *`. No flips occur as there are no sequences of opponent's pieces between two of your pieces.\n  - Column 1: The sequence becomes `0 * * *`. No flips occur as there are no sequences of opponent's pieces between two of your pieces.\n  - Diagonals: The sequence becomes `0 0 0`. The piece at (2,2) is between two black pieces (1,1) and (3,3), so it flips to black.\n\nFinal Board:\n```\n0 * * *\n* 0 1 1\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\nThe final game situation after this round is:\n<<<0,*,*,*,*,0,1,1,*,0,0,0,*,*,*,*>>>"
