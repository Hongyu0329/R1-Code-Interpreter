  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=6, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n******\n***1**\n*001**\n**01**\n******\n******\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,2)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the game situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 6x6.\n   - The initial configuration is:\n     ```\n     ******\n     ***1**\n     *001**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1 (Your Move)**:\n   - You play black (0) and place a piece at (3,2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     ******\n     ***1**\n     *000**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 3: Placing at (3,2) creates a line of 0s from (3,1) to (3,3), flipping the 1 at (3,3) to 0.\n     - Column 2: No flips as there are no 1s between two 0s.\n     - Diagonals: No flips as there are no 1s between two 0s.\n\n3. **Round 2 (Opponent's Move)**:\n   - The opponent plays white (1) and places a piece at (2,4).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     ******\n     ***11*\n     *000**\n     **01**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n   - Check for flips:\n     - Row 2: No flips as there are no 0s between two 1s.\n     - Column 4: The 0 at (3,4) is between the 1s at (2,4) and (4,4), so it flips to 1.\n     - Diagonals: No flips as there are no 0s between two 1s.\n\n4. **Final Grid After Round 2**:\n   - The grid after all flips is:\n     ```\n     ******\n     ***11*\n     *000**\n     **11**\n     ******\n     ******\n     ```\n\nThe final game situation after this round is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,1,1,*,*,0,0,0,*,*,1,1,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
