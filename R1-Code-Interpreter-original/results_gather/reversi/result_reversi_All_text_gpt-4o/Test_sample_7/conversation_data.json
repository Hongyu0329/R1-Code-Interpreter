  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n*0**\n*00*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (1,2)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To analyze the situation step by step, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   - The board is a 4x4 grid.\n   - The current board state is:\n     ```\n     * 0 * *\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n2. **Your Move:**\n   - You are playing as black (0).\n   - You place a black piece at position (1, 2).\n\n3. **Board After Placing the Piece:**\n   - The board now looks like this after placing the piece:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n4. **Flipping the Opponent's Pieces:**\n   - After placing the piece, we need to check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Check each direction from the newly placed piece at (1, 2):\n\n   - **Row Check:**\n     - Row 1: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Row 2: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Row 3: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Row 4: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n   - **Column Check:**\n     - Column 1: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Column 2: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Column 3: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Column 4: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n   - **Diagonal Check:**\n     - Diagonal from (1, 2) to (3, 4): No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Diagonal from (1, 2) to (3, 0): No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Diagonal from (1, 2) to (0, 3): No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Diagonal from (1, 2) to (2, 1): No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n5. **Final Board State:**\n   - Since there are no white pieces to flip, the board remains the same after placing the piece:\n     ```\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 0 *\n     * 0 1 *\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n6. **Output the Board:**\n   - The final board state is represented as:\n     <<<*,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>\n\nAnswer: <<<*,0,0,*,*,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
