  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n000*\n110*\n***0\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,1)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (3,1)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (4,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each round of the game step by step, applying the rules of the game to determine the state of the board after each move.\n\n### Initial Board State:\n```\n****\n000*\n110*\n***0\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your move (Black) at (2,1)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (2,1).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (2,1), the board looks like this:\n  ```\n  ****\n  0000\n  110*\n  ***0\n  ```\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 2: No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - Column 1: No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - Diagonals: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (3,1)\n- Place a white piece (1) at (3,1).\n- Check for any black pieces (0) that are between two white pieces (1) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (3,1), the board looks like this:\n  ```\n  ****\n  0000\n  110*\n  ***0\n  ```\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 3: No black pieces between white pieces.\n  - Column 1: No black pieces between white pieces.\n  - Diagonals: No black pieces between white pieces.\n\n### Round 3: Your move (Black) at (4,4)\n- Place a black piece (0) at (4,4).\n- Check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- After placing at (4,4), the board looks like this:\n  ```\n  ****\n  0000\n  110*\n  ***0\n  ```\n- Check for flips:\n  - Row 4: No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - Column 4: No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - Diagonal from (1,1) to (4,4): No white pieces between black pieces.\n  - Diagonal from (1,4) to (4,1): No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n### Final Board State:\nAfter all rounds, the board remains unchanged from the initial state after the moves, as no flips occurred in any round.\n\n```\n****\n0000\n110*\n***0\n```\n\nTherefore, the final board state after the given rounds is:\n<<<*,*,*,*,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,*,*,*,*,0>>>"
