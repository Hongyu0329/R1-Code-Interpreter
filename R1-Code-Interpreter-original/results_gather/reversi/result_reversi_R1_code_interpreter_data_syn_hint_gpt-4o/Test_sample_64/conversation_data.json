  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the moves of the game based on the given rules. We will start with the initial board configuration and apply the moves for each round, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary.\n\n### Initial Board Configuration\nThe board is a 6x6 grid, and the initial configuration is given as:\n```\n******\n**01**\n**01**\n**01**\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Round 1: Your Move\n- You play black (0) and place a piece at position (2,3).\n- After placing the piece, we need to check for any white pieces (1) that are between two black pieces (0) in the same row, column, or diagonal, and flip them to black.\n\n### Round 2: Opponent's Move\n- The opponent plays white (1) and places a piece at position (2,4).\n- Similarly, after placing the piece, we need to check for any black pieces (0) that are between two white pieces (1) and flip them to white.\n\nLet's simulate these moves using Python code to determine the final board configuration after these rounds.\n\n```python\n# Initial board configuration\nboard = [\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '0', '1', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '0', '1', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '0', '1', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n]\n\n# Function to flip pieces\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < 6 and 0 <= ny < 6 and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < 6 and 0 <= ny < 6 and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\n# Round 1: Your move (black) at (2, 3)\nboard[1][2] = '0'\nflip_pieces(board, 1, 2, '0')\n\n# Round 2: Opponent's move (white) at (2, 4)\nboard[1][3] = '1'\nflip_pieces(board, 1, 3, '1')\n\n# Print the final board configuration\nfinal_board = [cell for row in board for cell in row]\nprint(final_board)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the moves and print the final board configuration after both rounds.
