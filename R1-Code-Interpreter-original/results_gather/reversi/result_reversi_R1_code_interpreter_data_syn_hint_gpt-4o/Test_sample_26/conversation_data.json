  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n1***\n010*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,1)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (1,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the previous state of the board. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup**: We have a 4x4 board with the initial setup provided.\n2. **Round 1 (Your Move)**: You place a black piece (0) at position (2,1).\n3. **Flipping Rule**: After placing the piece, we need to check in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if there are any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0). If so, those white pieces should be flipped to black.\n4. **Round 2 (Opponent's Move)**: The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (1,1).\n5. **Flipping Rule**: Again, check in all directions for any black pieces (0) between two white pieces (1) and flip them to white.\n\nLet's simulate these steps using Python code to determine the final board state after these two rounds.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:\n            if board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n                pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            elif board[nx][ny] == player:\n                for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                    board[px][py] = player\n                break\n            else:\n                break\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['1', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['0', '1', '0', '*'],\n    ['*', '0', '1', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*']\n]\n\n# Round 1: Your move (Black) at (2,1)\nboard[1][0] = '0'\nflip_pieces(board, 1, 0, '0')\n\n# Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (1,1)\nboard[0][0] = '1'\nflip_pieces(board, 0, 0, '1')\n\n# Print the final board state\nprint_board(board)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the two rounds of the game and print the final board state.

    "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n1***\n010*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,1)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (1,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",
