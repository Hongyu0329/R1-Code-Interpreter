  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the moves of the game based on the given rules. We will start with the initial board configuration and apply the moves one by one, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary.\n\n### Initial Board Configuration\nThe board is a 6x6 grid, and the initial configuration is given as:\n```\n******\n***1**\n*001**\n**01**\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Moves\n1. **Round 1 (Your move as black):** Place a black piece at (3,2).\n2. **Round 2 (Opponent's move as white):** Place a white piece at (2,4).\n\n### Rules for Flipping\n- After placing a piece, check in all 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if there are any opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces. If so, flip those pieces.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n1. Update the board with the black piece at (3,2).\n2. Check and flip any white pieces that are between two black pieces.\n3. Update the board with the white piece at (2,4).\n4. Check and flip any black pieces that are between two white pieces.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the final board configuration after these moves.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    board = [\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '1', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '0', '0', '1', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '1', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Your move (black) at (3,2)\n    board[2][1] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 2, 1, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: Opponent's move (white) at (2,4)\n    board[1][3] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(board, 1, 3, '1')\n    \n    print_board(board)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the game and print the board configuration after the two rounds.
