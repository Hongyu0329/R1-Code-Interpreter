  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*10*\n*000\n**01\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (4,4)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (3,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the sequence of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a 4x4 grid with the initial configuration provided. We need to update this grid based on the moves.\n\n2. **Move Execution**: For each move, we place a piece on the specified position and then check in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if any opponent's pieces are flanked and need to be flipped.\n\n3. **Flipping Logic**: After placing a piece, we need to check in all 8 possible directions (left, right, up, down, and the four diagonals) to see if there are any sequences of opponent's pieces that are flanked by the player's pieces. If so, those pieces are flipped.\n\n4. **Simulate the Moves**: We will simulate the three rounds of moves as described.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the final state of the board after the given moves.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef is_valid_position(x, y, n):\n    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    n = len(board)\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), \n                  (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while is_valid_position(nx, ny, n) and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if is_valid_position(nx, ny, n) and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    n = 4\n    board = [\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '1', '0', '*'],\n        ['*', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '1']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Your move (Black) at (4,3)\n    board[3][2] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 3, 2, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (4,4)\n    board[3][3] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(board, 3, 3, '1')\n    \n    # Round 3: Your move (Black) at (3,4)\n    board[2][3] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 2, 3, '0')\n    \n    # Print the final board state\n    print_board(board)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the game based on the given moves and print the final state of the board.
