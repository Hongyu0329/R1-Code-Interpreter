  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n10**\n*10*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (1,2)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (1,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the current board state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup**: We have a 4x4 board with the following initial configuration:\n   ```\n   1 0 * *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1**: You place a black piece (0) at position (1,2). The board becomes:\n   ```\n   1 0 0 *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n   After placing the piece, we need to check for any opponent's pieces (1s) that are between two of your pieces (0s) in the same row, column, or diagonal, and flip them. In this case, no pieces are flipped because there are no 1s between two 0s.\n\n3. **Round 2**: The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (1,1). The board becomes:\n   ```\n   1 1 0 *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n   After placing the piece, we need to check for any of your pieces (0s) that are between two of the opponent's pieces (1s) in the same row, column, or diagonal, and flip them. In this case, the 0 at position (1,2) is between two 1s in the first row, so it gets flipped to 1.\n\n4. **Final Board State**: After flipping, the board looks like this:\n   ```\n   1 1 1 *\n   * 1 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\nNow, let's represent this final board state in the required format. Each cell is separated by a comma, and the entire board is enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\n<<<1,1,1,*,*,1,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
