  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n000*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the move of placing a black piece (0) at the position (2,1) on the grid and then apply the flipping rules of the game. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup**: We have a 4x4 grid with the following configuration:\n   ```\n   ****\n   000*\n   *01*\n   ****\n   ```\n\n2. **Placing the Piece**: We place a black piece (0) at position (2,1). The grid now looks like this:\n   ```\n   ****\n   000*\n   001*\n   ****\n   ```\n\n3. **Flipping the Pieces**: According to the rules, we need to check in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if there are any white pieces (1) between two black pieces (0) that need to be flipped.\n\n   - **Horizontal Check**: \n     - Row 2: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Row 3: No white pieces between black pieces.\n\n   - **Vertical Check**:\n     - Column 1: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Column 2: No white pieces between black pieces.\n     - Column 3: The white piece at (3,3) is between black pieces at (2,3) and (4,3) (if we consider the edge of the board as a black piece), so it should be flipped.\n\n   - **Diagonal Check**:\n     - No diagonal flips are possible in this configuration.\n\n4. **Final Grid Configuration**: After applying the flipping rules, the grid should look like this:\n   ```\n   ****\n   000*\n   000*\n   ****\n   ```\n\nNow, let's represent this grid in the required format and provide the final answer.\n\n<<<*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,0,0,0,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
