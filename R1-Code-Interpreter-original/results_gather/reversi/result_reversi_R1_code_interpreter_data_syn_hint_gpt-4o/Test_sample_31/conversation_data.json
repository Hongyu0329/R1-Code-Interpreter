  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n1***\n010*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,1)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (1,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a 4x4 grid with the initial configuration provided. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\n\n2. **Round 1**: The black player places a piece at position (2,1). We need to check in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if any white pieces are flanked by black pieces and flip them accordingly.\n\n3. **Round 2**: The white player places a piece at position (1,1). Again, we need to check in all directions to see if any black pieces are flanked by white pieces and flip them.\n\n4. **Output the Final Grid**: After both rounds, we will output the final configuration of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to simulate the game and determine the final grid configuration.\n\n```python\ndef flip_pieces(grid, x, y, player):\n    # Directions: right, left, down, up, down-right, down-left, up-right, up-left\n    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < 4 and 0 <= ny < 4 and grid[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < 4 and 0 <= ny < 4 and grid[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                grid[px][py] = player\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['1', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['0', '1', '0', '*'],\n    ['*', '0', '1', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*']\n]\n\n# Round 1: Black plays at (2,1)\ngrid[1][0] = '0'\nflip_pieces(grid, 1, 0, '0')\n\n# Round 2: White plays at (1,1)\ngrid[0][0] = '1'\nflip_pieces(grid, 0, 0, '1')\n\n# Output the final grid\nfinal_grid = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]\nprint(final_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the two rounds of the game and output the final grid configuration.

    "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n1***\n010*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,1)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (1,1)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",
