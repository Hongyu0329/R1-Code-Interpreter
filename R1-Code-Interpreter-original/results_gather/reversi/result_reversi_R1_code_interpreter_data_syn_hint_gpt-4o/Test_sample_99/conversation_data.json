  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=6, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n******\n*10***\n*000**\n**01**\n******\n******\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (2,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,2)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (3,2)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game of Reversi based on the given rules and the moves provided. We will update the board after each move and apply the flipping rules accordingly.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given board configuration.\n2. **Apply Moves**: For each move, place the piece on the board and check in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if any opponent's pieces are flanked and need to be flipped.\n3. **Update the Board**: After each move, update the board with the new configuration.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the final board configuration after the given moves.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef is_on_board(x, y, n):\n    return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player, opponent, n):\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    to_flip = []\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        while is_on_board(nx, ny, n) and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        if is_on_board(nx, ny, n) and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            to_flip.extend(pieces_to_flip)\n    for fx, fy in to_flip:\n        board[fx][fy] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    n = 6\n    board = [\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '1', '0', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '0', '0', '0', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '1', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n    ]\n\n    # Round 1: Your's landing position is (2,3)\n    board[2][3] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 2, 3, '0', '1', n)\n\n    # Round 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,2)\n    board[2][2] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(board, 2, 2, '1', '0', n)\n\n    # Round 3: Your's landing position is (3,2)\n    board[3][2] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 3, 2, '0', '1', n)\n\n    # Print the final board\n    print_board(board)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the game based on the given moves and print the final board configuration.
