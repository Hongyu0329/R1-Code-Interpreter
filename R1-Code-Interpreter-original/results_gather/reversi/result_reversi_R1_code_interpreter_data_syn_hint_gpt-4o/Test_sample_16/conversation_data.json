  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n*0**\n*00*\n*01*\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (1,2)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the move of placing a black piece (0) at the position (1,2) on the grid and then apply the flipping rules of the game. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup**: We have a 4x4 grid with the following initial configuration:\n   ```\n   * 0 * *\n   * 0 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n2. **Placing the Piece**: We place a black piece (0) at position (1,2). The grid now looks like this:\n   ```\n   * 0 * *\n   0 0 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n3. **Flipping the Pieces**: After placing the piece, we need to check all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if there are any white pieces (1) that are sandwiched between two black pieces (0). If so, those white pieces should be flipped to black.\n\n   - **Horizontal Check**: \n     - Row 1: No white pieces to flip.\n     - Row 2: No white pieces to flip.\n     - Row 3: No white pieces to flip.\n     - Row 4: No white pieces to flip.\n\n   - **Vertical Check**:\n     - Column 1: No white pieces to flip.\n     - Column 2: No white pieces to flip.\n     - Column 3: No white pieces to flip.\n     - Column 4: No white pieces to flip.\n\n   - **Diagonal Check**:\n     - No white pieces are sandwiched diagonally.\n\nSince there are no white pieces to flip in any direction, the grid remains unchanged after placing the piece.\n\n4. **Final Grid**: The grid after the move is:\n   ```\n   * 0 * *\n   0 0 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\nNow, let's represent this grid in the required format and provide the final answer.\n\n<<<*,0,*,*,0,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
