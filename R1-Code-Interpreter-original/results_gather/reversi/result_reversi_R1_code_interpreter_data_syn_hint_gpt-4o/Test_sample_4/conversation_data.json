    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the move of placing a black piece (0) at the position (2,1) on the grid and then apply the flipping rules of the game. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup**: We have a 4x4 grid with the following initial configuration:\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   0 0 0 *\n   * 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n2. **Place the Black Piece**: We place a black piece (0) at the position (2,1). The grid now looks like this:\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   0 0 0 *\n   0 0 1 *\n   * * * *\n   ```\n\n3. **Flipping Rule Application**: After placing the piece, we need to check all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if there are any white pieces (1) that are sandwiched between two black pieces (0). If so, those white pieces should be flipped to black.\n\n   - **Horizontal Check**: \n     - Row 2: No white pieces are sandwiched between black pieces.\n     - Row 3: The white piece at (3,3) is sandwiched between black pieces at (3,2) and (3,4) (if there was a black piece at (3,4), but there isn't), so no horizontal flip occurs.\n\n   - **Vertical Check**:\n     - Column 1: No white pieces are sandwiched between black pieces.\n     - Column 2: No white pieces are sandwiched between black pieces.\n     - Column 3: The white piece at (3,3) is sandwiched between black pieces at (2,3) and (4,3) (if there was a black piece at (4,3), but there isn't), so no vertical flip occurs.\n\n   - **Diagonal Check**:\n     - Diagonal from (2,1) to (4,3): The white piece at (3,3) is sandwiched between black pieces at (2,2) and (4,4) (if there was a black piece at (4,4), but there isn't), so no diagonal flip occurs.\n\nSince no white pieces are sandwiched between black pieces in any direction, no pieces are flipped.\n\n4. **Final Grid Configuration**: The grid remains unchanged after placing the black piece at (2,1) because no flips occur.\n\nLet's represent the final grid configuration in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<*,*,*,*,0,0,0,*,0,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>\n```"
