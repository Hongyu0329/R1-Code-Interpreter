  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n**0*\n*101\n*00*\n**0*\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (1,3)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. We will update the grid after each move and apply the flipping rules accordingly.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start with the given grid configuration.\n2. **Apply Moves**: For each move, place the piece on the specified position and check in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if any opponent's pieces are flanked and need to be flipped.\n3. **Update the Grid**: After each move, update the grid to reflect the new state.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the final state of the grid after the specified moves.\n\n```python\ndef print_grid(grid):\n    for row in grid:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(grid, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]\n    n = len(grid)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                grid[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    grid = [\n        ['*', '*', '0', '*'],\n        ['*', '1', '0', '1'],\n        ['*', '0', '0', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '*']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Your move (Black) at (4, 3)\n    grid[3][2] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(grid, 3, 2, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (2, 4)\n    grid[1][3] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(grid, 1, 3, '1')\n    \n    # Round 3: Your move (Black) at (1, 3)\n    grid[0][2] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(grid, 0, 2, '0')\n    \n    print_grid(grid)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the game and print the final state of the grid after the specified moves.
