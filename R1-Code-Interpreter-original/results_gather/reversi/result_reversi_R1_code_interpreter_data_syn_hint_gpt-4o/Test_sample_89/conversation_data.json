  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=6, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n******\n***0**\n**101*\n**000*\n******\n******\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,5)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (3,5)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (2,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a 6x6 grid with the initial configuration provided. The grid is represented as follows:\n   ```\n   ******\n   ***0**\n   **101*\n   **000*\n   ******\n   ******\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1**: You place a black piece (0) at position (4,5). We need to check in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if any white pieces (1) are flanked by black pieces and should be flipped.\n\n3. **Round 2**: The opponent places a white piece (1) at position (3,5). Again, we check in all directions for any black pieces (0) that are flanked and should be flipped.\n\n4. **Round 3**: You place a black piece (0) at position (2,4). We perform the same check for flanking and flipping.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the final state of the board after these moves.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    board = [\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '0', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '1', '0', '1', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '0', '0', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Your move\n    board[3][4] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 3, 4, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: Opponent's move\n    board[2][4] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(board, 2, 4, '1')\n    \n    # Round 3: Your move\n    board[1][3] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 1, 3, '0')\n    \n    print_board(board)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the game based on the given moves and print the final state of the board.
