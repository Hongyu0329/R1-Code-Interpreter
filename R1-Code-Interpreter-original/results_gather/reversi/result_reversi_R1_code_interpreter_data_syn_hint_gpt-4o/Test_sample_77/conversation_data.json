    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the current board state.

    "It seems that the code is not correctly implementing the flipping logic, as the board state remains unchanged. Let's switch to a more detailed textual reasoning approach to ensure we understand the flipping mechanism correctly.\n\n### Textual Reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Board State**:\n   ```\n   ******\n   ******\n   **10**\n   **010*\n   ****1*\n   ******\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1: Black plays at (4,5)**:\n   - Place a black piece at (4,5).\n   - Check all directions from (4,5) to see if there are any white pieces that can be flipped.\n   - The only direction with a potential flip is leftwards (4,4) to (4,3), but (4,3) is already black, so no flip occurs.\n\n3. **Round 2: White plays at (5,5)**:\n   - Place a white piece at (5,5).\n   - Check all directions from (5,5) to see if there are any black pieces that can be flipped.\n   - The only direction with a potential flip is upwards (5,4) to (4,4), but (4,4) is already white, so no flip occurs.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reason the board state did not change is that, according to the rules, no pieces were eligible to be flipped in either round. The initial code was correct in terms of logic, but the specific moves did not result in any flips.\n\nTherefore, the final board state after both rounds is:\n\n```\n******\n******\n**10**\n**0100\n****11\n******\n```\n\nThis is the correct board state after the specified moves. \n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
