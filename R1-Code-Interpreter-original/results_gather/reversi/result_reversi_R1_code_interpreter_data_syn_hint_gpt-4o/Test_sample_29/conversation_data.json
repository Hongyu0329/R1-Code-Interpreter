  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*111\n*00*\n**0*\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a 4x4 grid with the initial configuration provided. The grid is represented as follows:\n   ```\n   * * * *\n   * 1 1 1\n   * 0 0 *\n   * * 0 *\n   ```\n\n2. **Round 1 (Black's Move)**: Black places a piece at (4,3). We need to check all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if any white pieces are flanked and should be flipped.\n\n3. **Round 2 (White's Move)**: White places a piece at (2,4). Again, we need to check all directions to see if any black pieces are flanked and should be flipped.\n\n4. **Flipping Logic**: For each move, we need to check in all 8 possible directions (left, right, up, down, and the four diagonals) to see if there are any sequences of opponent's pieces that are flanked by the player's pieces. If so, those pieces are flipped.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the final state of the board after both moves.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(' '.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    board = [\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '1', '1', '1'],\n        ['*', '0', '0', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '*']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Black's move at (4,3)\n    board[3][2] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 3, 2, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: White's move at (2,4)\n    board[1][3] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(board, 1, 3, '1')\n    \n    return board\n\nfinal_board = play_game()\nprint_board(final_board)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the game and print the final board state after both moves.

    "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n****\n*111\n*00*\n**0*\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,3)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (2,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",
