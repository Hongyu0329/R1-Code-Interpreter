  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=6, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n******\n******\n*000**\n*111**\n******\n******\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (3,2)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (4,2)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the moves of the game based on the rules provided. We will start with the initial board configuration and apply the moves one by one, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary.\n\n### Initial Board Configuration\nThe board is a 6x6 grid, and the initial configuration is given as:\n```\n******\n******\n*000**\n*111**\n******\n******\n```\n\n### Moves\n1. **Round 1 (Your move as black):** Place a black piece at (3,2).\n2. **Round 2 (Opponent's move as white):** Place a white piece at (4,2).\n\n### Rules for Flipping\n- After placing a piece, check in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) for any of the opponent's pieces that are between two of the player's pieces. If found, flip those pieces.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n1. Apply the first move and flip any necessary pieces.\n2. Apply the second move and flip any necessary pieces.\n3.
