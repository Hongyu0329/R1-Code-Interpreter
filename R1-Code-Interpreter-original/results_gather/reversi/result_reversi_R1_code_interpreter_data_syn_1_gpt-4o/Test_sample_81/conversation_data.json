  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally.

Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. We will start with the initial board configuration and apply each move in sequence, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given board configuration.\n2. **Apply Moves**: For each move, place the piece on the specified position and flip the opponent's pieces according to the rules.\n3. **Check Flipping**: After placing a piece, check in all eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) to see if there are any opponent's pieces that need to be flipped.\n4. **Update the Board**: After each move, update the board with the new configuration.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to simulate the game and determine the final board configuration after the specified moves.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    board = [\n        ['*', '0', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '0', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '0', '1', '0', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '1', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Your move (Black) at (3, 2)\n    board[2][1] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 2, 1, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (2, 2)\n    board[1][1] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(board, 1, 1, '1')\n    \n    # Round 3: Your move (Black) at (1, 2)\n    board[0][1] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 0, 1, '0')\n    \n    print_board(board)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the game and print the final board configuration after the specified moves.

    "The code executed without any errors, and the output matches the expected board configuration after the specified moves.
