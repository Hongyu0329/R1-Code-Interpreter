    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. We will start with the initial board configuration and apply each move in sequence, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary.\n\n### Initial Board Configuration\nThe board is a 4x4 grid, and the initial configuration is given as:\n```\n1 0 * 0\n0 0 0 *\n* 0 1 *\n* * * *\n```\n\n### Moves\n1. **Round 1 (Your move as Black):** Place a black piece at (2,1).\n2. **Round 2 (Opponent's move as White):** Place a white piece at (1,3).\n3. **Round 3 (Your move as Black):** Place a black piece at (1,4).\n\n### Rules for Flipping\n- After placing a piece, check in all 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) for any of the opponent's pieces that are sandwiched between the newly placed piece and another piece of the same color. If found, flip those pieces.\n\n### Implementation\nWe will write a Python script to simulate these moves and update the board accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(' '.join(row))\n    print()\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    board = [\n        ['1', '0', '*', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '*'],\n        ['*', '0', '1', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Your move (Black) at (2,1)\n    board[1][0] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 1, 0, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (1,3)\n    board[0][2] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(board, 0, 2, '1')\n    \n    # Round 3: Your move (Black) at (1,4)\n    board[0][3] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 0, 3, '0')\n    \n    # Flatten the board to a single list\n    flat_board = [cell for row in board for cell in row]\n    print(flat_board)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis script will simulate the game and print the final board configuration as a flat list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output represents the final board configuration after the specified moves. The board is flattened into a single list, where each element corresponds to a cell in the 4x4 grid.\n\nThe final board configuration is:\n```\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 *\n* 0 1 *\n* * * *\n```\n\nThis configuration is represented as a flat list:\n<<<1,1,1,0,0,0,0,*,*,0,1,*,*,*,*,*>>>"
