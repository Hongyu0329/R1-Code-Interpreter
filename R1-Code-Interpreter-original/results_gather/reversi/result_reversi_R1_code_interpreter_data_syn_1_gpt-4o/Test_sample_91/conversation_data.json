After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. We will start with the initial board configuration and apply each move in sequence, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given board configuration.\n2. **Apply Round 1**: Place a black piece at (3,2) and flip any white pieces that are between two black pieces in any row, column, or diagonal.\n3. **Apply Round 2**: Place a white piece at (2,2) and flip any black pieces that are between two white pieces.\n4. **Apply Round 3**: Place a black piece at (5,4) and flip any white pieces that are between two black pieces.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate these steps:\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef apply_move(board, x, y, player):\n    board[x][y] = player\n    flip_pieces(board, x, y, player)\n\n# Initial board configuration\nboard = [\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '1', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '0', '1', '0', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '0', '0', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '0', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n]\n\n# Apply moves\napply_move(board, 3, 2, '0')  # Round 1\napply_move(board, 2, 2, '1')  # Round 2\napply_move(board, 5, 4, '0')  # Round 3\n\n# Print final board\nprint_board(board)\n```\n\nThis script will simulate the game and print the final board configuration after all the moves have been applied.
