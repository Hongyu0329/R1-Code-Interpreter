  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=6, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n******\n******\n**10**\n**010*\n****1*\n******\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (4,5)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (5,5)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the current board state. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given board state.\n2. **Apply Round 1 Move**: Place a black piece at position (4,5) and flip any white pieces that are between two black pieces in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n3. **Apply Round 2 Move**: Place a white piece at position (5,5) and flip any black pieces that are between two white pieces in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n4. **Output the Final Board State**: After applying both moves, output the final board state.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the final board state.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef apply_move(board, x, y, player):\n    board[x][y] = player\n    flip_pieces(board, x, y, player)\n\n# Initial board state\nboard = [\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '1', '0', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '0', '1', '0', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '1', '*'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n]\n\n# Apply Round 1: Black's move at (4,5)\napply_move(board, 3, 4, '0')\n\n# Apply Round 2: White's move at (5,5)\napply_move(board, 4, 4, '1')\n\n# Print the final board state\nprint_board(board)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the two rounds of moves and print the final board state.
