    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves provided. We will start with the initial board configuration and apply each move in sequence, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary according to the rules.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   - The board is a 4x4 grid.\n   - The initial configuration is:\n     ```\n     0 * * *\n     * 0 1 1\n     * 0 0 0\n     * * * *\n     ```\n\n2. **Round 1: Your Move (Black) at (3,4):**\n   - Place a black piece at (3,4).\n   - Check for any white pieces between two black pieces in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - After placing at (3,4), the board becomes:\n     ```\n     0 * * *\n     * 0 1 1\n     * 0 0 0\n     * * * 0\n     ```\n   - No white pieces are between two black pieces, so no flipping occurs.\n\n3. **Round 2: Opponent's Move (White) at (2,4):**\n   - Place a white piece at (2,4).\n   - Check for any black pieces between two white pieces.\n   - After placing at (2,4), the board becomes:\n     ```\n     0 * * *\n     * 0 1 1\n     * 0 0 0\n     * * 1 0\n     ```\n   - No black pieces are between two white pieces, so no flipping occurs.\n\n4. **Round 3: Your Move (Black) at (1,1):**\n   - Place a black piece at (1,1).\n   - Check for any white pieces between two black pieces.\n   - After placing at (1,1), the board becomes:\n     ```\n     0 0 * *\n     * 0 1 1\n     * 0 0 0\n     * * 1 0\n     ```\n   - No white pieces are between two black pieces, so no flipping occurs.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to verify the final board state.\n\n```python\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['0', '*', '*', '*'],\n    ['*', '0', '1', '1'],\n    ['*', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['*', '*', '*', '*']\n]\n\n# Function to place a piece and flip opponent's pieces\ndef place_piece(board, row, col, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    board[row][col] = player\n    \n    # Directions: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    \n    for dr, dc in directions:\n        r, c = row + dr, col + dc\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= r < 4 and 0 <= c < 4 and board[r][c] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((r, c))\n            r += dr\n            c += dc\n        \n        if 0 <= r < 4 and 0 <= c < 4 and board[r][c] == player:\n            for rr, cc in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[rr][cc] = player\n\n# Round 1: Your move (Black) at (3,4)\nplace_piece(board, 2, 3, '0')\n\n# Round 2: Opponent's move (White) at (2,4)\nplace_piece(board, 1, 3, '1')\n\n# Round 3: Your move (Black) at (1,1)\nplace_piece(board, 0, 1, '0')\n\n# Flatten the board to a single list\nflattened_board = [cell for row in board for cell in row]\nprint(flattened_board)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the final board state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final board state after all the moves is represented as a flattened list. Each element in the list corresponds to a cell in the 4x4 grid, read row by row.\n\nThe final board state is:\n```\n0 0 * *\n* 0 0 1\n* 0 0 0\n* * * *\n```\n\nThis matches the flattened list output:\n['0', '0', '*', '*', '*', '0', '0', '1', '*', '0', '0', '0', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0,0,*,*,*,0,0,1,*,0,0,0,*,*,*,*>>>"
