  "question": "There is a game similar to Reversi. On an n*n grid (where n is even), four pieces are placed in the center, two black and two white, arranged diagonally. Black pieces are represented by 0, white pieces by 1, and empty spaces by *.\nRules:\n1. Two players take turns placing pieces, one playing black and the other playing white.\n2. Each player places one piece on an empty space during their turn.\n3. After placing a piece, if there are any of the opponent's pieces between two of the player's pieces (in the same row, column, or diagonal), those pieces will be flipped to the player's color. That is, 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0.\nAll coordinates start from the first row and first column, and the coordinate (a, b) represents the cell in the a-th row and b-th column.\n\nGiven: n=4, you play black chess.\n\nThe previous round of the game was: \n*01*\n*00*\n*000\n****\n\nRound 1: Your's landing position is (1,2)\nRound 2: The opponent's landing position is (1,3)\nRound 3: Your's landing position is (3,4)\n\nPlease write down the game situation after this round based on the situation of the previous round.\nFor example, <<<*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*>>> represents the empty grid.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. We will start with the initial grid configuration and apply each move in sequence, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start with the given grid configuration.\n2. **Apply Round 1**: Place a black piece at (1,2) and flip any white pieces between two black pieces.\n3. **Apply Round 2**: Place a white piece at (1,3) and flip any black pieces between two white pieces.\n4. **Apply Round 3**: Place a black piece at (3,4) and flip any white pieces between two black pieces.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate these steps:\n\n```python\ndef print_grid(grid):\n    for row in grid:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(grid, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    n = len(grid)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                grid[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    grid = [\n        ['*', '0', '1', '*'],\n        ['*', '0', '0', '*'],\n        ['*', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Black plays at (1,2)\n    grid[0][1] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(grid, 0, 1, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: White plays at (1,3)\n    grid[0][2] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(grid, 0, 2, '1')\n    \n    # Round 3: Black plays at (3,4)\n    grid[2][3] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(grid, 2, 3, '0')\n    \n    # Flatten the grid for the final output\n    flat_grid = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]\n    print(flat_grid)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis script initializes the grid, applies each move, and flips the necessary pieces according to the rules.
