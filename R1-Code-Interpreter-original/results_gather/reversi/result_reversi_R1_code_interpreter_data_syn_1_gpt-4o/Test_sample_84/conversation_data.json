    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game based on the given rules and the moves made by both players. We will start with the initial board configuration and apply each move in sequence, flipping the opponent's pieces as necessary according to the rules.\n\n### Initial Board Configuration\nThe board is a 6x6 grid, and the initial configuration is given as:\n```\n******\n**0***\n**00**\n*101**\n**0***\n******\n```\n\n### Moves\n1. **Round 1 (Your move as black):** Place a black piece at (2,3).\n2. **Round 2 (Opponent's move as white):** Place a white piece at (4,2).\n3. **Round 3 (Your move as black):** Place a black piece at (5,3).\n\n### Rules for Flipping\n- After placing a piece, check in all 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) for any of the opponent's pieces that are sandwiched between the newly placed piece and another piece of the same color.\n- Flip any sandwiched opponent pieces to the player's color.\n\n### Implementation\nWe will write a Python script to simulate these moves and update the board accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(''.join(row))\n\ndef flip_pieces(board, x, y, player):\n    opponent = '1' if player == '0' else '0'\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    n = len(board)\n    \n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        pieces_to_flip = []\n        \n        while 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == opponent:\n            pieces_to_flip.append((nx, ny))\n            nx += dx\n            ny += dy\n        \n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and board[nx][ny] == player:\n            for px, py in pieces_to_flip:\n                board[px][py] = player\n\ndef play_game():\n    board = [\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '0', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '1', '0', '1', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '0', '*', '*', '*'],\n        ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']\n    ]\n    \n    # Round 1: Your move (black) at (2, 3)\n    board[2][3] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 2, 3, '0')\n    \n    # Round 2: Opponent's move (white) at (4, 2)\n    board[4][2] = '1'\n    flip_pieces(board, 4, 2, '1')\n    \n    # Round 3: Your move (black) at (5, 3)\n    board[5][3] = '0'\n    flip_pieces(board, 5, 3, '0')\n    \n    print_board(board)\n\nplay_game()\n```\n\nThis script will simulate the game and print the board after the third round. Let's execute the code to see the final board configuration.",
