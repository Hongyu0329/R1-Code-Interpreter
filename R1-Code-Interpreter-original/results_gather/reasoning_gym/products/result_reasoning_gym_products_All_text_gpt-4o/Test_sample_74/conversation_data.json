    "To solve the multiplication problem 8 * 8, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 8 and 8.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are adding 8 to itself 8 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with the number 8.\n   - Add 8 to it: 8 + 8 = 16.\n   - Add another 8: 16 + 8 = 24.\n   - Add another 8: 24 + 8 = 32.\n   - Add another 8: 32 + 8 = 40.\n   - Add another 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Add another 8: 48 + 8 = 56.\n   - Add another 8: 56 + 8 = 64.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the multiplication by using a different method, such as the multiplication table or repeated addition, to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Conclude the Result**: After verifying, the result of multiplying 8 by 8 is 64.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: As instructed, the final answer should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<64>>>"
