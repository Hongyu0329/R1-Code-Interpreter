    "To solve the multiplication problem 6 * 3, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 6 and 3.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are adding the number 6 to itself 3 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with the number 6.\n   - Add 6 to itself: 6 + 6 = 12.\n   - Add 6 again: 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n   - 6 * 3 means 6 added three times: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18.\n   - Alternatively, think of it as 3 groups of 6: 6, 6, 6, which also sums to 18.\n\n5. **Conclude the Calculation**: The result of multiplying 6 by 3 is 18.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: As per the instructions, the final answer should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
