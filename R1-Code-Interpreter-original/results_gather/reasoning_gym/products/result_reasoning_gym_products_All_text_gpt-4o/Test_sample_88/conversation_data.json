    "To solve the multiplication problem 91 * 85, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This approach will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers:**\n   - We can express 85 as (80 + 5).\n   - Therefore, the multiplication problem becomes 91 * (80 + 5).\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - According to the distributive property, a(b + c) = ab + ac.\n   - Applying this to our problem: 91 * (80 + 5) = 91 * 80 + 91 * 5.\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part Separately:**\n   - **Calculate 91 * 80:**\n     - First, calculate 91 * 8, then multiply the result by 10 (since 80 is 8 * 10).\n     - 91 * 8:\n       - Break down 91 as (90 + 1).\n       - 90 * 8 = 720\n       - 1 * 8 = 8\n       - Add these results: 720 + 8 = 728\n     - Now multiply by 10: 728 * 10 = 7280\n\n   - **Calculate 91 * 5:**\n     - Break down 91 as (90 + 1).\n     - 90 * 5 = 450\n     - 1 * 5 = 5\n     - Add these results: 450 + 5 = 455\n\n4. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Now, add the results from the two parts: 7280 + 455.\n   - Perform the addition:\n     - 7280\n     - + 455\n     ------\n     - 7735\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of 91 * 85 is 7735.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem is:\n\n<<<7735>>>"
