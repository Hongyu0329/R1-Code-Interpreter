    "To solve the multiplication problem 8 * 7, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 8 and 7.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication Facts**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are adding the number 8 to itself 7 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with 8.\n   - Add 8 to itself: 8 + 8 = 16.\n   - Add another 8: 16 + 8 = 24.\n   - Add another 8: 24 + 8 = 32.\n   - Add another 8: 32 + 8 = 40.\n   - Add another 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Add another 8: 48 + 8 = 56.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: To ensure accuracy, let's verify by counting the number of times 8 was added:\n   - 8 (1st time)\n   - 16 (2nd time)\n   - 24 (3rd time)\n   - 32 (4th time)\n   - 40 (5th time)\n   - 48 (6th time)\n   - 56 (7th time)\n\n   We added 8 a total of 7 times, confirming the multiplication was done correctly.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The result of multiplying 8 by 7 is 56.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 8 * 7 is:\n\n<<<56>>>"
