    "To solve the multiplication problem 39 * 60, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 39 and 60.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication**: \n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to simplify the calculation. \n   - The number 60 can be broken down into 10 * 6. Therefore, 39 * 60 can be rewritten as 39 * (10 * 6).\n\n3. **Apply the Distributive Property**:\n   - According to the distributive property, 39 * (10 * 6) is the same as (39 * 10) * 6.\n\n4. **Calculate 39 * 10**:\n   - Multiplying any number by 10 is straightforward: you simply add a zero to the end of the number.\n   - Therefore, 39 * 10 = 390.\n\n5. **Calculate 390 * 6**:\n   - Now, we need to multiply 390 by 6.\n   - Break it down further if needed: \n     - 390 can be split into 300 + 90.\n     - Calculate each part separately:\n       - 300 * 6 = 1800\n       - 90 * 6 = 540\n   - Add the results of these two multiplications:\n     - 1800 + 540 = 2340\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Double-check each step to ensure accuracy.\n   - Recalculate if necessary to confirm the result.\n\n7. **Final Result**:\n   - The result of multiplying 39 by 60 is 2340.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2340>>>"
