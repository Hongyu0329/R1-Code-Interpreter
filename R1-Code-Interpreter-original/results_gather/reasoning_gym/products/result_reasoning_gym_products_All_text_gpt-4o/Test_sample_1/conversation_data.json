    "To solve the multiplication problem 45 * 71, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 45 and 71.\n\n2. **Break Down the Numbers**: \n   - 45 can be broken down into 40 + 5.\n   - 71 can be broken down into 70 + 1.\n\n3. **Apply the Distributive Property**: \n   - The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. We can use this property to simplify the multiplication.\n   - Multiply each part of the first number by each part of the second number.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Component**:\n   - Multiply 40 by 70: \n     - 40 * 70 = 2800\n   - Multiply 40 by 1:\n     - 40 * 1 = 40\n   - Multiply 5 by 70:\n     - 5 * 70 = 350\n   - Multiply 5 by 1:\n     - 5 * 1 = 5\n\n5. **Add the Results Together**:\n   - Add all the products from the previous step:\n     - 2800 + 40 + 350 + 5\n\n6. **Perform the Addition**:\n   - 2800 + 40 = 2840\n   - 2840 + 350 = 3190\n   - 3190 + 5 = 3195\n\n7. **Final Result**: The result of multiplying 45 by 71 is 3195.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<3195>>>"
