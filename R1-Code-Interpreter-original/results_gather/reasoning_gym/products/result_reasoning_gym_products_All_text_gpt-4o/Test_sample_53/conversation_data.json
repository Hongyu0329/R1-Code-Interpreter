    "To solve the multiplication problem 24039 * 52057, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 24039 and 52057.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number, taking into account their respective place values, and then summing all the partial results.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply 24039 by each digit of 52057, starting from the rightmost digit (units place) and moving to the leftmost digit (ten-thousands place).\n\n4. **Calculate Partial Products:**\n   - Multiply 24039 by 7 (units place of 52057).\n   - Multiply 24039 by 5 (tens place of 52057), and shift one position to the left.\n   - Multiply 24039 by 0 (hundreds place of 52057), and shift two positions to the left.\n   - Multiply 24039 by 2 (thousands place of 52057), and shift three positions to the left.\n   - Multiply 24039 by 5 (ten-thousands place of 52057), and shift four positions to the left.\n\n5. **Sum the Partial Products:**\n   - Add all the partial products obtained from the above steps to get the final result.\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each step to ensure there are no errors in multiplication or addition.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- **Partial Products:**\n  - 24039 * 7 = 168273\n  - 24039 * 5 = 120195 (shift one position to the left: 1201950)\n  - 24039 * 0 = 0 (shift two positions to the left: 000000)\n  - 24039 * 2 = 48078 (shift three positions to the left: 48078000)\n  - 24039 * 5 = 120195 (shift four positions to the left: 1201950000)\n\n- **Sum of Partial Products:**\n  - 168273\n  - 1201950\n  - 000000\n  - 48078000\n  - 1201950000\n  - -----------------\n  - 1251452223\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe result of multiplying 24039 by 52057 is:\n\n<<<1251452223>>>"
