    "To solve the multiplication problem 53 * 29, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This involves splitting one of the numbers into parts that are easier to multiply, and then adding the results. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers:**\n   - We can break down 29 into 20 and 9. This makes it easier to multiply with 53.\n   - So, 53 * 29 can be rewritten as 53 * (20 + 9).\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - Using the distributive property, we can expand this to:\n     - 53 * 20 + 53 * 9\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - First, calculate 53 * 20:\n     - 53 * 20 = 53 * (2 * 10) = (53 * 2) * 10\n     - 53 * 2 = 106\n     - 106 * 10 = 1060\n   - Next, calculate 53 * 9:\n     - 53 * 9 = 477\n\n4. **Add the Results:**\n   - Now, add the two results from the above calculations:\n     - 1060 + 477 = 1537\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of 53 * 29 is 1537.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 53 * 29 is:\n\n<<<1537>>>"
