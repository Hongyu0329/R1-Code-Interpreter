    "To solve the multiplication problem 13627 * 40056, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 13627 and 40056.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to break down the problem:\n     \\[\n     13627 \\times 40056 = 13627 \\times (40000 + 56)\n     \\]\n   - This can be further expanded to:\n     \\[\n     13627 \\times 40000 + 13627 \\times 56\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **First Part: \\(13627 \\times 40000\\)**\n     - Multiply 13627 by 4, then append four zeros to the result (since 40000 is 4 followed by four zeros).\n     - \\(13627 \\times 4 = 54508\\)\n     - Therefore, \\(13627 \\times 40000 = 545080000\\)\n\n   - **Second Part: \\(13627 \\times 56\\)**\n     - Break down 56 into 50 + 6:\n     - \\(13627 \\times 50 = 13627 \\times (5 \\times 10) = (13627 \\times 5) \\times 10\\)\n     - \\(13627 \\times 5 = 68135\\)\n     - Therefore, \\(13627 \\times 50 = 681350\\)\n     - \\(13627 \\times 6 = 81762\\)\n     - Add the two results: \\(681350 + 81762 = 763112\\)\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Add the results from the two parts:\n     \\[\n     545080000 + 763112 = 545843112\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication 13627 * 40056 is 545843112.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe careful breakdown of the multiplication into smaller parts and the use of the distributive property ensures that each step is manageable and accurate. The final result of the multiplication is:\n\n<<<545843112>>>"
