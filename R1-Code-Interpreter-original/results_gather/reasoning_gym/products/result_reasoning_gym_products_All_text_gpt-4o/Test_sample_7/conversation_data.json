    "To solve the multiplication problem 494 * 126, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We will multiply 494 by each digit of 126, starting from the rightmost digit, and then sum the results.\n\n2. **Multiply by the Units Digit (6):**\n   - Multiply 494 by 6.\n   - 494 * 6 = 2964.\n\n3. **Multiply by the Tens Digit (2):**\n   - Multiply 494 by 2, but since this is the tens place, we need to multiply by 20.\n   - 494 * 2 = 988.\n   - 988 * 10 = 9880.\n\n4. **Multiply by the Hundreds Digit (1):**\n   - Multiply 494 by 1, but since this is the hundreds place, we need to multiply by 100.\n   - 494 * 1 = 494.\n   - 494 * 100 = 49400.\n\n5. **Add the Results:**\n   - Now, add the results of the three multiplications:\n     - 2964 (from step 2)\n     - 9880 (from step 3)\n     - 49400 (from step 4)\n\n6. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and add them:\n     ```\n       49400\n      +  9880\n      +  2964\n     --------\n       62244\n     ```\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of multiplying 494 by 126 is 62244.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication 494 * 126 is enclosed within triple angle brackets as follows:\n\n<<<62244>>>"
