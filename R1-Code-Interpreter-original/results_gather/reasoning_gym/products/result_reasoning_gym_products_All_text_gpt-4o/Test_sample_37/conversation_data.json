    "To solve the multiplication problem 2 * 1, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem is asking us to multiply two numbers: 2 and 1.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: \n   - The first number is 2.\n   - The second number is 1.\n\n3. **Recall the Multiplication Rule**: \n   - Multiplication is a mathematical operation that combines two numbers to produce a third number, known as the product.\n   - The multiplication of any number by 1 results in the number itself. This is known as the identity property of multiplication.\n\n4. **Apply the Multiplication Rule**:\n   - Multiply 2 by 1.\n   - According to the identity property, multiplying any number by 1 gives the number itself.\n\n5. **Calculate the Product**:\n   - 2 * 1 = 2\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Double-check the multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n   - The calculation is straightforward and follows the identity property of multiplication.\n\n7. **Conclude with the Final Answer**:\n   - The product of 2 and 1 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 2 * 1 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
