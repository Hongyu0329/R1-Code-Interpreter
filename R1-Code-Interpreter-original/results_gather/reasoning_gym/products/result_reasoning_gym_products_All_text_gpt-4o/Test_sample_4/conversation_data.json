    "To solve the multiplication problem 0 * 4, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Multiplication**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. For example, 4 * 3 means adding 4 three times (4 + 4 + 4).\n\n2. **Multiplication with Zero**: One of the fundamental properties of multiplication is that any number multiplied by zero is zero. This is because zero added to itself any number of times is still zero.\n\n3. **Applying the Property**: In the given problem, we have 0 * 4. According to the property mentioned above, multiplying zero by any number (in this case, 4) results in zero.\n\n4. **Verification**: To ensure accuracy, consider the definition of multiplication again. If you were to add zero to itself four times (0 + 0 + 0 + 0), the result is still zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the property of multiplication with zero and the verification, the result of 0 * 4 is zero.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 0 * 4 is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
