    "To solve the multiplication problem 2664 * 2085, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in our calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 2664 and 2085.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to break down the problem:\n     \\[\n     2664 \\times 2085 = 2664 \\times (2000 + 80 + 5)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Multiply 2664 by Each Component:**\n   - **Multiply by 2000:**\n     \\[\n     2664 \\times 2000 = 2664 \\times 2 \\times 1000 = 5328 \\times 1000 = 5328000\n     \\]\n   - **Multiply by 80:**\n     \\[\n     2664 \\times 80 = 2664 \\times 8 \\times 10 = 21312 \\times 10 = 213120\n     \\]\n   - **Multiply by 5:**\n     \\[\n     2664 \\times 5 = 13320\n     \\]\n\n4. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Now, add the results of the individual multiplications:\n     \\[\n     5328000 + 213120 + 13320\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - First, add 5328000 and 213120:\n     \\[\n     5328000 + 213120 = 5541120\n     \\]\n   - Then, add the result to 13320:\n     \\[\n     5541120 + 13320 = 5554440\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication 2664 * 2085 is 5554440.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe result of multiplying 2664 by 2085 is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5554440>>>."
