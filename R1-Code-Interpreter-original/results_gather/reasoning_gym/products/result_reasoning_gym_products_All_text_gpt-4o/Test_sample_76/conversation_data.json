    "To solve the multiplication problem 6 * 4, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 6 and 4.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are adding the number 6 to itself 4 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with the number 6.\n   - Add 6 to itself: 6 + 6 = 12.\n   - Add 6 again: 12 + 6 = 18.\n   - Add 6 one more time: 18 + 6 = 24.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: To ensure accuracy, let's verify the calculation by considering the reverse operation, division. If 6 * 4 = 24, then 24 divided by 4 should equal 6, and 24 divided by 6 should equal 4. Both checks confirm the multiplication is correct.\n\n5. **Consider Alternative Methods**: Another way to verify is by using the distributive property of multiplication over addition:\n   - Break down 6 as (2 + 4).\n   - Multiply each part by 4: (2 * 4) + (4 * 4).\n   - Calculate: 8 + 16 = 24.\n\n6. **Final Result**: After verifying through different methods, the result of 6 * 4 is confirmed to be 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem is:\n\n<<<24>>>"
