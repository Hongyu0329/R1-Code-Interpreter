    "To solve the multiplication problem 28 * 48, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This approach will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers:**\n   - We can express 28 as (20 + 8).\n   - We can express 48 as (40 + 8).\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. We will apply this property to both numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Component:**\n   - First, multiply 28 by 40:\n     - 28 * 40 = (20 + 8) * 40\n     - = 20 * 40 + 8 * 40\n     - = 800 + 320\n     - = 1120\n\n   - Next, multiply 28 by 8:\n     - 28 * 8 = (20 + 8) * 8\n     - = 20 * 8 + 8 * 8\n     - = 160 + 64\n     - = 224\n\n4. **Add the Results:**\n   - Now, add the two results from the above calculations:\n     - 1120 + 224 = 1344\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - To ensure accuracy, let's verify by using another method, such as the standard multiplication algorithm:\n     - Write 28 and 48 in a column format and multiply as follows:\n       - 28\n       - x 48\n       - ------\n       - 224  (28 * 8)\n       - 1120 (28 * 40, shifted one position to the left)\n       - ------\n       - 1344\n\n   - Both methods give the same result, confirming the accuracy of our calculation.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of multiplying 28 by 48 is:\n\n<<<1344>>>"
