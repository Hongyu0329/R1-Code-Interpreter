    "To solve the multiplication problem 4 * 3, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation**: The problem requires us to perform a multiplication operation. Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are multiplying 4 by 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The two numbers involved in this multiplication are 4 and 3.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**: \n   - Multiply 4 by 3. This means we add the number 4 to itself 3 times.\n   - Calculation: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - Double-check the multiplication by considering the commutative property of multiplication, which states that the order of numbers does not affect the product. Therefore, 4 * 3 is the same as 3 * 4.\n   - Calculate 3 * 4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12.\n   - Both calculations give the same result, confirming the accuracy.\n\n5. **Enclose the Result**: According to the instructions, the result should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer to the multiplication problem 4 * 3 is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
