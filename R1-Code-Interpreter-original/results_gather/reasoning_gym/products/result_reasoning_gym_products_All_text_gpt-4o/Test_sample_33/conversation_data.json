    "To solve the multiplication problem 394 * 626, we will break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm. This involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then adding the results together, taking care of the place values.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We will multiply 394 by each digit of 626, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2. **Multiply by the Units Digit (6):**\n   - Multiply 394 by 6.\n   - 394 * 6 = 2364.\n\n3. **Multiply by the Tens Digit (2):**\n   - Multiply 394 by 2, but remember this is actually 20 because it is in the tens place.\n   - 394 * 2 = 788.\n   - Since this is the tens place, we add a zero to the result: 7880.\n\n4. **Multiply by the Hundreds Digit (6):**\n   - Multiply 394 by 6, but remember this is actually 600 because it is in the hundreds place.\n   - 394 * 6 = 2364.\n   - Since this is the hundreds place, we add two zeros to the result: 236400.\n\n5. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Now, we add up all the partial results:\n     - 2364 (from step 2)\n     - 7880 (from step 3)\n     - 236400 (from step 4)\n\n6. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and add them:\n     ```\n       2364\n      +7880\n     +236400\n     --------\n     246644\n     ```\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of multiplying 394 by 626 is 246644.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<246644>>>."
