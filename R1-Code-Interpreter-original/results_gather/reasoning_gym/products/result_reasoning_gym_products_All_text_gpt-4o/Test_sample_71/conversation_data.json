    "To solve the multiplication problem 98 * 19, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This property allows us to multiply each part separately and then add the results together. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers:**\n   - We can express 19 as (20 - 1) to make the multiplication easier.\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - Multiply 98 by each part of the expression (20 - 1).\n   - This gives us: 98 * 19 = 98 * (20 - 1).\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - First, calculate 98 * 20:\n     - 98 * 20 can be broken down further as (98 * 2) * 10.\n     - Calculate 98 * 2:\n       - 98 * 2 = 196.\n     - Now multiply 196 by 10:\n       - 196 * 10 = 1960.\n   - Next, calculate 98 * 1:\n     - 98 * 1 = 98.\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Subtract the result of 98 * 1 from the result of 98 * 20:\n   - 1960 - 98 = 1862.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of 98 * 19 is 1862.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication 98 * 19 is:\n\n<<<1862>>>"
