    "To solve the multiplication problem 4278 * 3929, we will break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Write the Numbers:**\n   - We have two numbers: 4278 and 3929.\n\n2. **Multiply Each Digit of the Second Number by the First Number:**\n   - Start with the rightmost digit of the second number (3929), which is 9.\n   - Multiply 4278 by 9.\n\n3. **Calculate 4278 * 9:**\n   - 8 * 9 = 72. Write 2, carry over 7.\n   - 7 * 9 = 63. Add the carry over 7 to get 70. Write 0, carry over 7.\n   - 2 * 9 = 18. Add the carry over 7 to get 25. Write 5, carry over 2.\n   - 4 * 9 = 36. Add the carry over 2 to get 38. Write 38.\n   - Result: 4278 * 9 = 38502.\n\n4. **Multiply 4278 by the Next Digit (2) of 3929:**\n   - Shift one position to the left (since it's the tens place).\n   - Multiply 4278 by 2.\n\n5. **Calculate 4278 * 2:**\n   - 8 * 2 = 16. Write 6, carry over 1.\n   - 7 * 2 = 14. Add the carry over 1 to get 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n   - 2 * 2 = 4. Add the carry over 1 to get 5. Write 5.\n   - 4 * 2 = 8. Write 8.\n   - Result: 4278 * 2 = 8556.\n   - Shift one position to the left: 85560.\n\n6. **Multiply 4278 by the Next Digit (9) of 3929:**\n   - Shift two positions to the left (since it's the hundreds place).\n   - Multiply 4278 by 9 (same as step 3).\n\n7. **Calculate 4278 * 9 Again:**\n   - Result: 4278 * 9 = 38502.\n   - Shift two positions to the left: 3850200.\n\n8. **Multiply 4278 by the Last Digit (3) of 3929:**\n   - Shift three positions to the left (since it's the thousands place).\n   - Multiply 4278 by 3.\n\n9. **Calculate 4278 * 3:**\n   - 8 * 3 = 24. Write 4, carry over 2.\n   - 7 * 3 = 21. Add the carry over 2 to get 23. Write 3, carry over 2.\n   - 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carry over 2 to get 8. Write 8.\n   - 4 * 3 = 12. Write 12.\n   - Result: 4278 * 3 = 12834.\n   - Shift three positions to the left: 12834000.\n\n10. **Add All the Results Together:**\n    - 38502\n    - 85560\n    - 3850200\n    - 12834000\n\n11. **Perform the Addition:**\n    - Align the numbers by their rightmost digits and add them:\n      ```\n      000038502\n      000085560\n      003850200\n      12834000\n      ----------\n      168111162\n      ```\n\n12. **Final Result:**\n    - The result of multiplying 4278 by 3929 is 16,811,162.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<168111162>>>"
