    "To solve the multiplication problem 86 * 48, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We need to multiply 86 by 48. This can be broken down into two separate multiplications using the distributive property:\n     - Multiply 86 by 40 (the tens place of 48).\n     - Multiply 86 by 8 (the units place of 48).\n\n2. **Multiply 86 by 8:**\n   - Start with the units place of 48, which is 8.\n   - Multiply 86 by 8:\n     - 6 * 8 = 48. Write down 8 and carry over 4.\n     - 8 * 8 = 64. Add the carried over 4 to get 68.\n   - The result of 86 * 8 is 688.\n\n3. **Multiply 86 by 40:**\n   - Now, multiply 86 by 40. Since 40 is 4 tens, we can multiply 86 by 4 and then multiply the result by 10.\n   - Multiply 86 by 4:\n     - 6 * 4 = 24. Write down 4 and carry over 2.\n     - 8 * 4 = 32. Add the carried over 2 to get 34.\n   - The result of 86 * 4 is 344.\n   - Since we are actually multiplying by 40, we need to multiply 344 by 10, which is equivalent to adding a zero at the end: 3440.\n\n4. **Add the Two Results:**\n   - Now, add the results of the two multiplications:\n     - 688 (from 86 * 8)\n     - 3440 (from 86 * 40)\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and add:\n     ```\n       3440\n     +  688\n     ------\n       4128\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of multiplying 86 by 48 is 4128.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication 86 * 48 is enclosed within triple angle brackets as follows:\n\n<<<4128>>>"
