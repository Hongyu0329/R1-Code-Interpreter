    "To solve the multiplication problem 903 * 858, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps and ensure accuracy at each stage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 903 and 858.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to simplify the process:\n     \\[\n     903 \\times 858 = 903 \\times (800 + 50 + 8)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Multiply 903 by Each Component:**\n   - **Multiply by 800:**\n     \\[\n     903 \\times 800 = 903 \\times 8 \\times 100\n     \\]\n     - First, calculate \\(903 \\times 8\\):\n       \\[\n       903 \\times 8 = 7224\n       \\]\n     - Then multiply the result by 100:\n       \\[\n       7224 \\times 100 = 722400\n       \\]\n\n   - **Multiply by 50:**\n     \\[\n     903 \\times 50 = 903 \\times 5 \\times 10\n     \\]\n     - First, calculate \\(903 \\times 5\\):\n       \\[\n       903 \\times 5 = 4515\n       \\]\n     - Then multiply the result by 10:\n       \\[\n       4515 \\times 10 = 45150\n       \\]\n\n   - **Multiply by 8:**\n     \\[\n     903 \\times 8 = 7224\n     \\]\n     (This was already calculated in the first part.)\n\n4. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Now, add all the partial products:\n     \\[\n     722400 + 45150 + 7224\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Add the numbers step by step:\n     - First, add 722400 and 45150:\n       \\[\n       722400 + 45150 = 767550\n       \\]\n     - Then add 7224 to the result:\n       \\[\n       767550 + 7224 = 774774\n       \\]\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication 903 * 858 is 774774.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication problem is:\n\n<<<774774>>>"
