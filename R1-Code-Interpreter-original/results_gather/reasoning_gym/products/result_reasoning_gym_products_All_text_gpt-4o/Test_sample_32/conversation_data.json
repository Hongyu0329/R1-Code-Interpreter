    "To solve the multiplication problem 9 * 6, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 9 and 6.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication Facts**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are adding the number 9 to itself 6 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with 9.\n   - Add 9 to itself: 9 + 9 = 18.\n   - Add another 9: 18 + 9 = 27.\n   - Add another 9: 27 + 9 = 36.\n   - Add another 9: 36 + 9 = 45.\n   - Add another 9: 45 + 9 = 54.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the addition to ensure accuracy:\n   - 9 + 9 = 18\n   - 18 + 9 = 27\n   - 27 + 9 = 36\n   - 36 + 9 = 45\n   - 45 + 9 = 54\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The result of multiplying 9 by 6 is 54.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 9 * 6 is:\n\n<<<54>>>"
