    "To solve the multiplication problem 51612 * 11575, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in our calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 51612 and 11575.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of the place values.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit of the Second Number:**\n   - Start with the rightmost digit of 11575, which is 5.\n   - Multiply 51612 by 5.\n   - Then, move to the next digit, which is 7, and multiply 51612 by 7, but remember to shift one place to the left (i.e., multiply by 70).\n   - Continue this process for each digit of 11575, shifting one place to the left each time.\n\n4. **Perform the Calculations:**\n   - Multiply 51612 by 5:\n     - 51612 * 5 = 258060\n   - Multiply 51612 by 7 (shifted one place to the left):\n     - 51612 * 70 = 3612840\n   - Multiply 51612 by 5 (shifted two places to the left):\n     - 51612 * 500 = 25806000\n   - Multiply 51612 by 1 (shifted three places to the left):\n     - 51612 * 1000 = 51612000\n   - Multiply 51612 by 1 (shifted four places to the left):\n     - 51612 * 10000 = 51612000\n\n5. **Add the Results:**\n   - Align the results according to their place values and add them together:\n     ```\n     258060\n    3612840\n   25806000\n   51612000\n  516120000\n  ------------\n  597086900\n     ```\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each multiplication and addition step to ensure accuracy.\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of multiplying 51612 by 11575 is 597086900.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter carefully performing each step and verifying the calculations, the final result of the multiplication 51612 * 11575 is:\n\n<<<597086900>>>"
