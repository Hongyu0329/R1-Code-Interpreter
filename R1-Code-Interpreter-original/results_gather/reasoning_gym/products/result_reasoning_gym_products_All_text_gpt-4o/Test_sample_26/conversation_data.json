    "To solve the multiplication problem 92 * 35, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This involves splitting one of the numbers into parts that are easier to multiply, and then adding the results.\n\n1. **Break down the numbers:**\n   - We can break down 35 into 30 and 5. This allows us to use the distributive property: \n     \\[\n     92 \\times 35 = 92 \\times (30 + 5)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property:**\n   - Distribute 92 to both 30 and 5:\n     \\[\n     92 \\times 35 = (92 \\times 30) + (92 \\times 5)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate each part separately:**\n   - First, calculate \\(92 \\times 30\\):\n     - \\(92 \\times 30\\) can be calculated as:\n       \\[\n       92 \\times 30 = 92 \\times (3 \\times 10) = (92 \\times 3) \\times 10\n       \\]\n     - Calculate \\(92 \\times 3\\):\n       \\[\n       92 \\times 3 = 276\n       \\]\n     - Multiply the result by 10:\n       \\[\n       276 \\times 10 = 2760\n       \\]\n\n   - Next, calculate \\(92 \\times 5\\):\n     - \\(92 \\times 5\\) is:\n       \\[\n       92 \\times 5 = 460\n       \\]\n\n4. **Add the results:**\n   - Add the two products obtained from the above calculations:\n     \\[\n     2760 + 460 = 3220\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   - The result of multiplying 92 by 35 is 3220.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3220>>>"
