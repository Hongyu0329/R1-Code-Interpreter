    "To solve the multiplication problem 789 * 505, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can express 505 as 500 + 5. This allows us to use the distributive property of multiplication to simplify the problem:\n     \\[\n     789 \\times 505 = 789 \\times (500 + 5)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - Using the distributive property, we can split the multiplication into two separate parts:\n     \\[\n     789 \\times 505 = (789 \\times 500) + (789 \\times 5)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part Separately:**\n   - **First Part: \\(789 \\times 500\\)**\n     - Multiply 789 by 500:\n       \\[\n       789 \\times 500 = 789 \\times 5 \\times 100 = (789 \\times 5) \\times 100\n       \\]\n     - First, calculate \\(789 \\times 5\\):\n       \\[\n       789 \\times 5 = 3945\n       \\]\n     - Then, multiply the result by 100:\n       \\[\n       3945 \\times 100 = 394500\n       \\]\n\n   - **Second Part: \\(789 \\times 5\\)**\n     - We already calculated this in the previous step:\n       \\[\n       789 \\times 5 = 3945\n       \\]\n\n4. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Now, add the results of the two parts:\n     \\[\n     394500 + 3945 = 398445\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication 789 * 505 is 398445.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication problem is:\n\n<<<398445>>>"
