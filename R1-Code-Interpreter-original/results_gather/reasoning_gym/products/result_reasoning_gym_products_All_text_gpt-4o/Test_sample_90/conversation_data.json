    "To solve the multiplication problem 49622 * 19304, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 49622 and 19304.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of the place value.\n\n3. **Multiply Digit by Digit:**\n   - Start with the rightmost digit of the second number (4 in 19304) and multiply it by the entire first number (49622).\n   - Repeat this process for each digit in 19304, shifting one place to the left each time.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Partial Product:**\n   - Multiply 49622 by 4 (units place of 19304).\n   - Multiply 49622 by 0 (tens place of 19304), which will result in 0.\n   - Multiply 49622 by 3 (hundreds place of 19304).\n   - Multiply 49622 by 9 (thousands place of 19304).\n   - Multiply 49622 by 1 (ten-thousands place of 19304).\n\n5. **Align the Partial Products:**\n   - Align each partial product according to its place value (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).\n\n6. **Sum the Partial Products:**\n   - Add all the aligned partial products to get the final result.\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\n- **49622 * 4 = 198488**\n- **49622 * 0 = 0** (shifted one place to the left)\n- **49622 * 3 = 148866** (shifted two places to the left)\n- **49622 * 9 = 446598** (shifted three places to the left)\n- **49622 * 1 = 49622** (shifted four places to the left)\n\n### Align and Sum the Partial Products:\n\n```\n   198488\n+      0\n+  1488660\n+ 44659800\n+49622000\n-----------\n  957931288\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter summing all the partial products, the final result of the multiplication 49622 * 19304 is:\n\n<<<957931288>>>"
