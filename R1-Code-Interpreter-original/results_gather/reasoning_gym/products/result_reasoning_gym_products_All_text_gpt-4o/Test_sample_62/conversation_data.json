    "To solve the multiplication problem 4 * 4, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation**: The problem requires us to perform a multiplication operation. Multiplication is a basic arithmetic operation that involves finding the product of two numbers.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers involved in this multiplication are both 4. This means we are multiplying 4 by itself.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**: \n   - Multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. So, 4 * 4 can be seen as adding the number 4 to itself 4 times.\n   - Let's add: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4.\n\n4. **Calculate Step by Step**:\n   - First, add the first two 4s: 4 + 4 = 8.\n   - Next, add the result to the next 4: 8 + 4 = 12.\n   - Finally, add the last 4: 12 + 4 = 16.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - To ensure accuracy, let's verify by using another method, such as the multiplication table or another quick calculation.\n   - According to the multiplication table, 4 times 4 is indeed 16.\n\n6. **Conclude with the Result**: The product of 4 and 4 is 16.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 4 * 4 is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
