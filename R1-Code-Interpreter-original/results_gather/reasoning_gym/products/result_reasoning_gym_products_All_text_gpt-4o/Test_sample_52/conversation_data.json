    "To solve the multiplication problem 7 * 0, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Multiplication by Zero**: \n   - Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. \n   - When you multiply any number by zero, you are essentially adding that number zero times. \n   - This means you are not adding the number at all, resulting in a total of zero.\n\n2. **Applying the Rule**:\n   - The rule of multiplication by zero states that any number multiplied by zero equals zero. This is a fundamental property of multiplication.\n\n3. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   - Given the expression 7 * 0, apply the rule: \n     - Multiply 7 by 0.\n     - According to the rule, the result is 0.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - To ensure accuracy, consider the logic: \n     - If you have 7 groups of zero items, you have zero items in total.\n     - This confirms that multiplying by zero results in zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The multiplication of 7 by 0 results in 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 7 * 0 is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
