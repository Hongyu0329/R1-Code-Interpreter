    "To solve the multiplication problem 42474 * 63930, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 42474 and 63930.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then summing the results appropriately.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit:**\n   - Start by multiplying 42474 by each digit of 63930, starting from the rightmost digit (units place) to the leftmost digit (ten-thousands place).\n\n4. **Calculate Partial Products:**\n   - Multiply 42474 by 0 (units place of 63930): 42474 * 0 = 0\n   - Multiply 42474 by 3 (tens place of 63930): 42474 * 3 = 127422\n   - Multiply 42474 by 9 (hundreds place of 63930): 42474 * 9 = 382266\n   - Multiply 42474 by 3 (thousands place of 63930): 42474 * 3 = 127422\n   - Multiply 42474 by 6 (ten-thousands place of 63930): 42474 * 6 = 254844\n\n5. **Align the Partial Products:**\n   - Align each partial product according to its place value:\n     - 0 (no shift needed)\n     - 127422 (shift one position to the left)\n     - 382266 (shift two positions to the left)\n     - 127422 (shift three positions to the left)\n     - 254844 (shift four positions to the left)\n\n6. **Sum the Partial Products:**\n   - Add all the aligned partial products together:\n     ```\n     000000\n     1274220\n    38226600\n   127422000\n  2548440000\n  ------------\n  2714873820\n     ```\n\n7. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each step to ensure there are no errors in multiplication or addition.\n\n8. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of multiplying 42474 by 63930 is 2714873820.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe result of the multiplication 42474 * 63930 is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<2714873820>>>"
