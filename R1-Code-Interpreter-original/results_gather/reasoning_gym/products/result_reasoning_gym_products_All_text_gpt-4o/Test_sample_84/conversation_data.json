    "To solve the multiplication problem 1 * 2, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation**: The problem involves a basic multiplication operation. Multiplication is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic, with the others being addition, subtraction, and division.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers involved in this multiplication are 1 and 2.\n\n3. **Apply the Multiplication Rule**: The rule for multiplication is to take one number and add it to itself as many times as the other number indicates. In this case, we take the number 1 and add it to itself 2 times.\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Start with the number 1.\n   - Add 1 to itself 2 times: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy. Multiplying any number by 1 results in the number itself. Therefore, 1 * 2 = 2.\n\n6. **Conclude with the Result**: The result of the multiplication is 2.\n\nFinally, present the result enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<2>>>"
