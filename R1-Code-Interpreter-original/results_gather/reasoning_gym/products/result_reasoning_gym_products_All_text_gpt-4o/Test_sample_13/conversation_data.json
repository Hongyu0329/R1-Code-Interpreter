    "To solve the multiplication problem 8995 * 5221, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in our calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 8995 and 5221.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of place values.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit of the Second Number:**\n   - Start with the rightmost digit of 5221, which is 1:\n     - \\( 8995 \\times 1 = 8995 \\)\n   - Move to the next digit, which is 2 (in the tens place):\n     - \\( 8995 \\times 2 = 17990 \\)\n     - Since this is in the tens place, we add a zero to the result: \\( 179900 \\)\n   - Move to the next digit, which is 2 (in the hundreds place):\n     - \\( 8995 \\times 2 = 17990 \\)\n     - Since this is in the hundreds place, we add two zeros to the result: \\( 1799000 \\)\n   - Move to the leftmost digit, which is 5 (in the thousands place):\n     - \\( 8995 \\times 5 = 44975 \\)\n     - Since this is in the thousands place, we add three zeros to the result: \\( 44975000 \\)\n\n4. **Sum the Partial Results:**\n   - Align the results according to their place values and sum them:\n     - \\( 8995 \\)\n     - \\( 179900 \\)\n     - \\( 1799000 \\)\n     - \\( 44975000 \\)\n   - Add these numbers together:\n     - \\( 8995 + 179900 + 1799000 + 44975000 = 469522195 \\)\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each multiplication and addition step to ensure there are no errors.\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of multiplying 8995 by 5221 is 469522195.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of the multiplication 8995 * 5221 is enclosed within triple angle brackets as follows:\n\n<<<469522195>>>"
