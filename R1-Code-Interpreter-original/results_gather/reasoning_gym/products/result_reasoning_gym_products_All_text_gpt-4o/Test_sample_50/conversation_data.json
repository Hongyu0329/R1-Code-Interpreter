    "To solve the multiplication problem 9275 * 5786, we will break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm. This involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then summing the results appropriately.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Write the numbers in a column format:**\n   ```\n     9275\n   x 5786\n   ```\n\n2. **Multiply 9275 by each digit of 5786, starting from the rightmost digit:**\n\n   - **Multiply by 6 (units place of 5786):**\n     - 9275 * 6 = 55650\n\n   - **Multiply by 8 (tens place of 5786):**\n     - 9275 * 8 = 74200\n     - Since this is the tens place, add a zero to the right: 74200 becomes 742000\n\n   - **Multiply by 7 (hundreds place of 5786):**\n     - 9275 * 7 = 64925\n     - Since this is the hundreds place, add two zeros to the right: 64925 becomes 6492500\n\n   - **Multiply by 5 (thousands place of 5786):**\n     - 9275 * 5 = 46375\n     - Since this is the thousands place, add three zeros to the right: 46375 becomes 46375000\n\n3. **Add all the results together:**\n   ```\n     55650\n   + 742000\n   + 6492500\n   + 46375000\n   ```\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n\n   - Start by aligning the numbers by their rightmost digits:\n     ```\n         55650\n        742000\n       6492500\n      46375000\n     ```\n\n   - Add the numbers column by column from right to left:\n     - Units column: 0\n     - Tens column: 0\n     - Hundreds column: 0\n     - Thousands column: 0\n     - Ten-thousands column: 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5\n     - Hundred-thousands column: 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6\n     - Millions column: 5 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 7\n     - Ten-millions column: 4 + 9 + 0 = 13 (write 3, carry 1)\n     - Hundred-millions column: 7 + 4 + 1 = 12 (write 2, carry 1)\n     - Ten-hundred-millions column: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n   - The final sum is: 53675250\n\n5. **Enclose the result within triple angle brackets:**\n\n   The final result of the multiplication 9275 * 5786 is:\n\n   <<<53675250>>>"
