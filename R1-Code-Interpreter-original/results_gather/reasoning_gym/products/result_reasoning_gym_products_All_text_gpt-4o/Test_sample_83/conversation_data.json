    "To solve the multiplication problem 24 * 78, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers**: \n   - We have two numbers: 24 and 78.\n\n2. **Use the Distributive Property**:\n   - The distributive property of multiplication over addition allows us to break down one of the numbers into parts. We can express 78 as (70 + 8).\n\n3. **Multiply Each Part Separately**:\n   - First, multiply 24 by 70.\n   - Then, multiply 24 by 8.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Multiplication**:\n   - **24 * 70**:\n     - Break down 70 as 7 * 10.\n     - First, calculate 24 * 7:\n       - 24 * 7 = 168.\n     - Then, multiply the result by 10:\n       - 168 * 10 = 1680.\n   - **24 * 8**:\n     - Calculate 24 * 8 directly:\n       - 24 * 8 = 192.\n\n5. **Add the Results Together**:\n   - Add the results of the two multiplications:\n     - 1680 + 192 = 1872.\n\n6. **Final Result**:\n   - The result of multiplying 24 by 78 is 1872.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication 24 * 78 is:\n\n<<<1872>>>"
