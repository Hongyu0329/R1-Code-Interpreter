    "To solve the multiplication problem 6726 * 3669, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in our calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 6726 and 3669.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of the place values.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit:**\n   - Start with the rightmost digit of the second number (9 in 3669) and multiply it by the entire first number (6726).\n   - Then, move to the next digit (6 in 3669), multiply it by 6726, and remember to shift one position to the left (i.e., multiply by 10).\n   - Continue this process for each digit in 3669.\n\n4. **Detailed Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply 6726 by 9:\n     - 6726 * 9 = 60534\n   - Multiply 6726 by 6 (shifted one position to the left, i.e., multiply by 60):\n     - 6726 * 6 = 40356\n     - Shift left: 403560\n   - Multiply 6726 by 6 again (shifted two positions to the left, i.e., multiply by 600):\n     - 6726 * 6 = 40356\n     - Shift left: 4035600\n   - Multiply 6726 by 3 (shifted three positions to the left, i.e., multiply by 3000):\n     - 6726 * 3 = 20178\n     - Shift left: 20178000\n\n5. **Add the Results:**\n   - Align the results according to their place values and add them:\n     - 60534\n     - 403560\n     - 4035600\n     - 20178000\n   - Sum these values:\n     - 60534\n     - 403560\n     - 4035600\n     - 20178000\n     - ___________\n     - 24673194\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of multiplying 6726 by 3669 is 24,673,194.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter carefully performing the multiplication and addition, the final result of 6726 * 3669 is:\n\n<<<24673194>>>"
