    "To solve the multiplication problem 81 * 78, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This approach will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers:**\n   - We can express 78 as (80 - 2) to simplify the multiplication process.\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. We can use this property to break down the multiplication:\n   - 81 * 78 = 81 * (80 - 2)\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part Separately:**\n   - First, calculate 81 * 80:\n     - 81 * 80 can be broken down further as 81 * (8 * 10).\n     - Calculate 81 * 8:\n       - 81 * 8 = 648 (since 80 is 8 tens, we multiply by 10 next).\n     - Multiply the result by 10:\n       - 648 * 10 = 6480\n   - Next, calculate 81 * 2:\n     - 81 * 2 = 162\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Now, subtract the second result from the first:\n   - 6480 - 162 = 6318\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each step to ensure there are no errors in the arithmetic.\n\nBy following these steps, we have carefully calculated the product of 81 and 78.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of multiplying 81 by 78 is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<6318>>>"
