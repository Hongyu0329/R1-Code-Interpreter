    "To solve the multiplication problem 7 * 9, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 7 and 9.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication Facts**: \n   - Multiplication is a form of repeated addition. \n   - 7 * 9 means adding the number 7 a total of 9 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with 7 and add it 9 times:\n     - 7 + 7 = 14\n     - 14 + 7 = 21\n     - 21 + 7 = 28\n     - 28 + 7 = 35\n     - 35 + 7 = 42\n     - 42 + 7 = 49\n     - 49 + 7 = 56\n     - 56 + 7 = 63\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Double-check the addition to ensure accuracy.\n   - Alternatively, use the commutative property of multiplication (7 * 9 = 9 * 7) and verify by adding 9 a total of 7 times:\n     - 9 + 9 = 18\n     - 18 + 9 = 27\n     - 27 + 9 = 36\n     - 36 + 9 = 45\n     - 45 + 9 = 54\n     - 54 + 9 = 63\n\n5. **Conclude the Result**:\n   - Both methods confirm that the result of 7 * 9 is 63.\n\n6. **Enclose the Result**:\n   - As per the instructions, the final result should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<63>>>."
