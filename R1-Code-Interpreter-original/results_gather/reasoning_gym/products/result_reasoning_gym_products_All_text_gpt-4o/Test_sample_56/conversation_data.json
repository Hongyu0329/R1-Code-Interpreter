    "To solve the multiplication problem 52 * 33, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then summing the results. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Break down the numbers:**\n   - 52 can be expressed as (50 + 2).\n   - 33 can be expressed as (30 + 3).\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property:**\n   - Multiply each part of the first number by each part of the second number:\n     - (50 * 30)\n     - (50 * 3)\n     - (2 * 30)\n     - (2 * 3)\n\n3. **Calculate each multiplication:**\n   - 50 * 30 = 1500\n   - 50 * 3 = 150\n   - 2 * 30 = 60\n   - 2 * 3 = 6\n\n4. **Sum the results:**\n   - Add all the products together: 1500 + 150 + 60 + 6\n\n5. **Perform the addition:**\n   - 1500 + 150 = 1650\n   - 1650 + 60 = 1710\n   - 1710 + 6 = 1716\n\n6. **Final result:**\n   - The result of multiplying 52 by 33 is 1716.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<1716>>>"
