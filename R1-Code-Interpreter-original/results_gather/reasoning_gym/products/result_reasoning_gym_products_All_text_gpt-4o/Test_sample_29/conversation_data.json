    "To solve the multiplication problem 81 * 37, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This involves splitting one of the numbers into parts, multiplying each part separately, and then adding the results together.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers:**\n   - We can break down 37 into 30 and 7. This makes the multiplication easier to handle.\n   - So, 81 * 37 can be rewritten as 81 * (30 + 7).\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - According to the distributive property, a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c.\n   - Therefore, 81 * (30 + 7) = 81 * 30 + 81 * 7.\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **81 * 30:**\n     - First, calculate 81 * 3, then multiply the result by 10.\n     - 81 * 3 = 243.\n     - 243 * 10 = 2430.\n   - **81 * 7:**\n     - Directly multiply 81 by 7.\n     - 81 * 7 = 567.\n\n4. **Add the Results:**\n   - Now, add the results of the two multiplications.\n   - 2430 + 567 = 2997.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of 81 * 37 is 2997.\n\nBy following these steps, we have carefully broken down the multiplication into simpler parts and calculated the final result.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2997>>>."
