    "To solve the multiplication problem 472 * 752, we will break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We will multiply 472 by each digit of 752, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2. **Multiply by the Units Digit (2):**\n   - Multiply 472 by 2.\n   - 472 * 2 = 944.\n\n3. **Multiply by the Tens Digit (5):**\n   - Multiply 472 by 5, but remember this is actually 50 because it is in the tens place.\n   - 472 * 5 = 2360.\n   - Since it is in the tens place, we add a zero to the end: 2360 becomes 23600.\n\n4. **Multiply by the Hundreds Digit (7):**\n   - Multiply 472 by 7, but remember this is actually 700 because it is in the hundreds place.\n   - 472 * 7 = 3304.\n   - Since it is in the hundreds place, we add two zeros to the end: 3304 becomes 330400.\n\n5. **Add the Partial Products:**\n   - Now, we add up all the partial products:\n     - 944 (from 472 * 2)\n     - 23600 (from 472 * 50)\n     - 330400 (from 472 * 700)\n\n6. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Align the numbers by their rightmost digits and add them:\n     ```\n       944\n     23600\n    330400\n    -------\n    354944\n     ```\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of multiplying 472 by 752 is 354944.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<354944>>>."
