    "To solve the multiplication problem 29 * 48, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This involves splitting one of the numbers into parts that are easier to multiply, and then adding the results.\n\n1. **Break down the numbers:**\n   - We can break down 48 into 40 and 8. This makes it easier to multiply with 29.\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property:**\n   - Multiply 29 by each part of 48 separately, and then add the results.\n   - Calculate 29 * 40\n   - Calculate 29 * 8\n\n3. **Calculate 29 * 40:**\n   - First, calculate 29 * 4, then multiply the result by 10 (since 40 is 4 * 10).\n   - 29 * 4 = 116\n   - 116 * 10 = 1160\n\n4. **Calculate 29 * 8:**\n   - Directly multiply 29 by 8.\n   - 29 * 8 = 232\n\n5. **Add the results:**\n   - Add the results from the two multiplications: 1160 + 232.\n\n6. **Perform the addition:**\n   - 1160 + 232 = 1392\n\nTherefore, the result of multiplying 29 by 48 is 1392.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<1392>>>"
