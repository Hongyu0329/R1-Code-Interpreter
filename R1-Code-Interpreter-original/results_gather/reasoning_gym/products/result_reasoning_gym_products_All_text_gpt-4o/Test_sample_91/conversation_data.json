    "To solve the multiplication problem 189 * 887, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers**: \n   - We have two numbers: 189 and 887.\n\n2. **Use the Distributive Property**:\n   - We can break down 887 into (800 + 80 + 7) to make the multiplication easier.\n\n3. **Multiply 189 by Each Part of 887**:\n   - First, multiply 189 by 800.\n   - Then, multiply 189 by 80.\n   - Finally, multiply 189 by 7.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Multiplication**:\n   - **189 * 800**:\n     - 189 * 8 = 1512\n     - 1512 * 100 = 151200\n   - **189 * 80**:\n     - 189 * 8 = 1512\n     - 1512 * 10 = 15120\n   - **189 * 7**:\n     - 189 * 7 = 1323\n\n5. **Add the Results Together**:\n   - Add the results of the three multiplications:\n     - 151200 (from 189 * 800)\n     - 15120 (from 189 * 80)\n     - 1323 (from 189 * 7)\n\n6. **Perform the Addition**:\n   - 151200 + 15120 = 166320\n   - 166320 + 1323 = 167643\n\n7. **Final Result**:\n   - The result of multiplying 189 by 887 is 167643.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<167643>>>"
