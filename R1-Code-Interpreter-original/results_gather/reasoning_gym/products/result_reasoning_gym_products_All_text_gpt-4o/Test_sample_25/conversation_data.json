    "To solve the multiplication problem 703 * 719, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in our calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 703 and 719.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to simplify the process:\n     \\[\n     703 \\times 719 = 703 \\times (700 + 19)\n     \\]\n   - This can be expanded to:\n     \\[\n     703 \\times 700 + 703 \\times 19\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **703 multiplied by 700:**\n     - First, multiply 703 by 7:\n       \\[\n       703 \\times 7 = 4921\n       \\]\n     - Then, multiply the result by 100 (since 700 is 7 times 100):\n       \\[\n       4921 \\times 100 = 492100\n       \\]\n\n   - **703 multiplied by 19:**\n     - Break down 19 as (20 - 1) to simplify:\n       \\[\n       703 \\times 19 = 703 \\times (20 - 1)\n       \\]\n     - Calculate each part:\n       - \\(703 \\times 20 = 14060\\)\n       - \\(703 \\times 1 = 703\\)\n     - Subtract the second result from the first:\n       \\[\n       14060 - 703 = 13357\n       \\]\n\n4. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Combine the results from the two main parts:\n     \\[\n     492100 + 13357 = 505457\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each step to ensure there are no arithmetic errors.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of multiplying 703 by 719 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{505457}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<505457>>>"
