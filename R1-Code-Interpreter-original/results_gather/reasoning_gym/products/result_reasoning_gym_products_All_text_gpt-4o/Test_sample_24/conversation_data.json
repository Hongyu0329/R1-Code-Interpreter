    "To solve the multiplication problem 9573 * 5933, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in our calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 9573 and 5933.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then adding the results appropriately.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit:**\n   - Start by multiplying the units digit of the second number (3) by each digit of the first number (9573):\n     - 3 * 3 = 9\n     - 3 * 7 = 21 (write 1, carry over 2)\n     - 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17 (write 7, carry over 1)\n     - 3 * 9 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28\n   - Result of this step: 28719\n\n4. **Shift and Multiply Next Digit:**\n   - Multiply the tens digit of the second number (3) by each digit of the first number (9573), shifting one position to the left:\n     - 3 * 3 = 9\n     - 3 * 7 = 21 (write 1, carry over 2)\n     - 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17 (write 7, carry over 1)\n     - 3 * 9 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28\n   - Result of this step: 287190 (shifted one position to the left)\n\n5. **Continue with Hundreds Digit:**\n   - Multiply the hundreds digit of the second number (9) by each digit of the first number (9573), shifting two positions to the left:\n     - 9 * 3 = 27 (write 7, carry over 2)\n     - 9 * 7 = 63 + 2 (carry) = 65 (write 5, carry over 6)\n     - 9 * 5 = 45 + 6 (carry) = 51 (write 1, carry over 5)\n     - 9 * 9 = 81 + 5 (carry) = 86\n   - Result of this step: 8615700 (shifted two positions to the left)\n\n6. **Continue with Thousands Digit:**\n   - Multiply the thousands digit of the second number (5) by each digit of the first number (9573), shifting three positions to the left:\n     - 5 * 3 = 15 (write 5, carry over 1)\n     - 5 * 7 = 35 + 1 (carry) = 36 (write 6, carry over 3)\n     - 5 * 5 = 25 + 3 (carry) = 28 (write 8, carry over 2)\n     - 5 * 9 = 45 + 2 (carry) = 47\n   - Result of this step: 47865000 (shifted three positions to the left)\n\n7. **Add All Results Together:**\n   - Align all the results from each step and add them together:\n     ```\n     28719\n    287190\n   8615700\n  47865000\n  ---------\n  56790159\n     ```\n\n8. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of multiplying 9573 by 5933 is 56790159.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication 9573 * 5933 is:\n\n<<<56790159>>>"
