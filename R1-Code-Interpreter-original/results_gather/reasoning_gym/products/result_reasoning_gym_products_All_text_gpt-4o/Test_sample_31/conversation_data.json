    "To solve the multiplication problem 5818 * 5144, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 5818 and 5144.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then summing the results appropriately.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit:**\n   - Start by multiplying 5818 by each digit of 5144, beginning from the rightmost digit.\n\n4. **Calculate Partial Products:**\n   - Multiply 5818 by 4 (the rightmost digit of 5144):\n     - 5818 * 4 = 23272\n   - Multiply 5818 by 4 (the second digit from the right of 5144):\n     - 5818 * 4 = 23272\n     - Shift this result one position to the left (multiply by 10): 232720\n   - Multiply 5818 by 1 (the third digit from the right of 5144):\n     - 5818 * 1 = 5818\n     - Shift this result two positions to the left (multiply by 100): 581800\n   - Multiply 5818 by 5 (the leftmost digit of 5144):\n     - 5818 * 5 = 29090\n     - Shift this result three positions to the left (multiply by 1000): 29090000\n\n5. **Sum the Partial Products:**\n   - Add all the partial products together:\n     - 23272\n     - 232720\n     - 581800\n     - 29090000\n   - Perform the addition:\n     - 23272\n     + 232720\n     + 581800\n     + 29090000\n     = 29919792\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each step to ensure there are no errors in multiplication or addition.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of multiplying 5818 by 5144 is:\n\n<<<29919792>>>"
