    "To solve the multiplication problem 5881 * 8913, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in our calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 5881 and 8913.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then summing the results appropriately.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit:**\n   - Start by multiplying 5881 by each digit of 8913, beginning from the rightmost digit (units place) and moving to the left (thousands place).\n\n4. **Calculate Partial Products:**\n   - Multiply 5881 by 3 (units place of 8913):\n     - 5881 * 3 = 17643\n   - Multiply 5881 by 1 (tens place of 8913, shift one position to the left):\n     - 5881 * 1 = 5881 (shifted one position to the left becomes 58810)\n   - Multiply 5881 by 9 (hundreds place of 8913, shift two positions to the left):\n     - 5881 * 9 = 52929 (shifted two positions to the left becomes 5292900)\n   - Multiply 5881 by 8 (thousands place of 8913, shift three positions to the left):\n     - 5881 * 8 = 47048 (shifted three positions to the left becomes 47048000)\n\n5. **Sum the Partial Products:**\n   - Add all the partial products together:\n     - 17643\n     - 58810\n     - 5292900\n     - 47048000\n   - Sum: 17643 + 58810 + 5292900 + 47048000 = 52433103\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each multiplication and addition step to ensure accuracy.\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of multiplying 5881 by 8913 is 52433103.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of the multiplication 5881 * 8913 is enclosed within triple angle brackets as follows:\n\n<<<52433103>>>"
