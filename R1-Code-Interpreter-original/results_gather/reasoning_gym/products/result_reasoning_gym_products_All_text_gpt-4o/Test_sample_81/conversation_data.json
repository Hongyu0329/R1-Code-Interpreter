    "To solve the multiplication problem 118 * 589, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Multiplication**: \n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to break down the problem:\n   - 118 * 589 = 118 * (500 + 80 + 9)\n\n2. **Multiply 118 by Each Component**:\n   - First, multiply 118 by 500:\n     - 118 * 500 = 118 * (5 * 100) = (118 * 5) * 100\n     - 118 * 5 = 590\n     - 590 * 100 = 59000\n\n   - Next, multiply 118 by 80:\n     - 118 * 80 = 118 * (8 * 10) = (118 * 8) * 10\n     - 118 * 8 = 944\n     - 944 * 10 = 9440\n\n   - Finally, multiply 118 by 9:\n     - 118 * 9 = 1062\n\n3. **Add the Results Together**:\n   - Now, add the results of the three multiplications:\n   - 59000 + 9440 + 1062\n\n4. **Perform the Addition**:\n   - Add 59000 and 9440:\n     - 59000 + 9440 = 68440\n   - Add the result to 1062:\n     - 68440 + 1062 = 69502\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - The final result of the multiplication 118 * 589 is 69502.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication problem is:\n\n<<<69502>>>"
