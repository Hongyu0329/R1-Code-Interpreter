    "To solve the multiplication problem 671 * 644, we will break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Write the numbers in a column format:**\n   ```\n     671\n   x 644\n   ```\n\n2. **Multiply the bottom number (644) by each digit of the top number (671), starting from the rightmost digit:**\n\n   - **Multiply 671 by 4 (the rightmost digit of 644):**\n     - 671 * 4 = 2684\n\n   - **Multiply 671 by 4 (the middle digit of 644):**\n     - 671 * 4 = 2684\n     - Since this is the middle digit, we need to shift the result one position to the left (equivalent to multiplying by 10):\n     - 2684 becomes 26840\n\n   - **Multiply 671 by 6 (the leftmost digit of 644):**\n     - 671 * 6 = 4026\n     - Since this is the leftmost digit, we need to shift the result two positions to the left (equivalent to multiplying by 100):\n     - 4026 becomes 402600\n\n3. **Add the results of these multiplications together:**\n   ```\n       2684\n     +26840\n    +402600\n    --------\n     432724\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the addition:**\n   - Add the numbers carefully to ensure accuracy:\n     - 2684 + 26840 = 29524\n     - 29524 + 402600 = 432724\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of multiplying 671 by 644 is 432724.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<432724>>>"
