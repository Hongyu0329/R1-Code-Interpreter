    "To solve the multiplication problem 56307 * 24891, we will break down the process into a series of careful steps to ensure accuracy. Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two large numbers: 56307 and 24891.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication**: We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of the place value.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit**:\n   - Start with the rightmost digit of the second number (1 in 24891) and multiply it by 56307.\n   - Then, move to the next digit (9 in 24891), multiply it by 56307, and shift the result one place to the left.\n   - Continue this process for each digit in 24891 (8, 4, and 2), shifting each result one additional place to the left.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Partial Product**:\n   - \\( 56307 \\times 1 = 56307 \\)\n   - \\( 56307 \\times 9 = 506763 \\) (shifted one place to the left, becomes 5067630)\n   - \\( 56307 \\times 8 = 450456 \\) (shifted two places to the left, becomes 45045600)\n   - \\( 56307 \\times 4 = 225228 \\) (shifted three places to the left, becomes 225228000)\n   - \\( 56307 \\times 2 = 112614 \\) (shifted four places to the left, becomes 1126140000)\n\n5. **Sum the Partial Products**:\n   - Align the partial products according to their place values and add them together:\n     - 56307\n     - 5067630\n     - 45045600\n     - 225228000\n     - 1126140000\n\n6. **Perform the Addition**:\n   - Add the numbers carefully, ensuring each column is summed correctly:\n     - Start from the rightmost column and move to the left, carrying over any values as needed.\n\n7. **Final Result**:\n   - After adding all the partial products, the final result of the multiplication is obtained.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that each part of the multiplication is handled correctly, and the final sum gives us the accurate result of the multiplication.\n\nThe final result of the multiplication 56307 * 24891 is:\n\n<<<1401115137>>>"
