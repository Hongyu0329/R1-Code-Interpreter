    "To solve the multiplication problem 336 * 270, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers**: \n   - 336 can be broken down into 300 + 30 + 6.\n   - 270 can be broken down into 200 + 70.\n\n2. **Use the Distributive Property**:\n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition to simplify the calculation:\n   - (300 + 30 + 6) * (200 + 70) = 300 * 200 + 300 * 70 + 30 * 200 + 30 * 70 + 6 * 200 + 6 * 70.\n\n3. **Calculate Each Term**:\n   - 300 * 200 = 60,000\n   - 300 * 70 = 21,000\n   - 30 * 200 = 6,000\n   - 30 * 70 = 2,100\n   - 6 * 200 = 1,200\n   - 6 * 70 = 420\n\n4. **Add the Results**:\n   - Add all the products together to get the final result:\n   - 60,000 + 21,000 + 6,000 + 2,100 + 1,200 + 420 = 90,720\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - The result of multiplying 336 by 270 is 90,720.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<90720>>>"
