    "To solve the multiplication problem 78 * 95, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This approach will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Numbers:**\n   - We can express 95 as (100 - 5) to simplify the multiplication process.\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - The expression 78 * 95 can be rewritten using the distributive property as:\n     \\[\n     78 \\times (100 - 5) = 78 \\times 100 - 78 \\times 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **Calculate 78 * 100:**\n     - Multiplying by 100 is straightforward: \n       \\[\n       78 \\times 100 = 7800\n       \\]\n   - **Calculate 78 * 5:**\n     - Break it down further if needed, or calculate directly:\n       \\[\n       78 \\times 5 = 390\n       \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the Results:**\n   - Now, subtract the result of 78 * 5 from 78 * 100:\n     \\[\n     7800 - 390 = 7410\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each step to ensure there are no errors in the arithmetic.\n\nBy following these steps, we have calculated the product of 78 and 95 accurately.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of the multiplication 78 * 95 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7410}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<7410>>>"
