    "To solve the multiplication problem 91242 * 49171, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 91242 and 49171.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of the place value.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply 91242 by each digit of 49171, starting from the rightmost digit (units place) and moving to the left (tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten-thousands places).\n\n4. **Calculate Each Partial Product:**\n   - Multiply 91242 by 1 (units place of 49171): 91242\n   - Multiply 91242 by 7 (tens place of 49171): 6386940 (shift one position to the left)\n   - Multiply 91242 by 1 (hundreds place of 49171): 9124200 (shift two positions to the left)\n   - Multiply 91242 by 9 (thousands place of 49171): 82117800 (shift three positions to the left)\n   - Multiply 91242 by 4 (ten-thousands place of 49171): 364968000 (shift four positions to the left)\n\n5. **Sum the Partial Products:**\n   - Align the partial products according to their place values and add them together:\n     - 91242\n     - 6386940\n     - 9124200\n     - 82117800\n     - 364968000\n\n6. **Add the Results:**\n   - Start adding from the rightmost column to the left, carrying over any values as needed:\n     - 91242\n     - + 6386940\n     - + 9124200\n     - + 82117800\n     - + 364968000\n     - = 4485155082\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of multiplying 91242 by 49171 is 4485155082.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter carefully performing the multiplication and summing the partial products, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4485155082>>>"
