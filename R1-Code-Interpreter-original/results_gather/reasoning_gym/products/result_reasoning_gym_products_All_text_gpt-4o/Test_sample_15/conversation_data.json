    "To solve the multiplication problem 6 * 8, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 6 and 8.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication Facts**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are adding the number 6 to itself 8 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with the number 6.\n   - Add 6 to itself 8 times:\n     - 6 + 6 = 12\n     - 12 + 6 = 18\n     - 18 + 6 = 24\n     - 24 + 6 = 30\n     - 30 + 6 = 36\n     - 36 + 6 = 42\n     - 42 + 6 = 48\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the multiplication by using another method, such as the distributive property or by using a multiplication table. In this case, using a multiplication table confirms that 6 * 8 = 48.\n\n5. **Conclude with the Result**: The result of multiplying 6 by 8 is 48.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 6 * 8 is:\n\n<<<48>>>"
