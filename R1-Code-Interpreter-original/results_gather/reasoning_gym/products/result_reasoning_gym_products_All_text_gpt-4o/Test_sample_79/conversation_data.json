    "To solve the multiplication problem 605 * 298, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to break down the problem:\n     \\[\n     605 \\times 298 = 605 \\times (300 - 2)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - Distribute 605 across the terms in the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     605 \\times 298 = 605 \\times 300 - 605 \\times 2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **Calculate \\(605 \\times 300\\):**\n     - First, calculate \\(605 \\times 3\\):\n       \\[\n       605 \\times 3 = 1815\n       \\]\n     - Then multiply the result by 100 (since 300 is 3 times 100):\n       \\[\n       1815 \\times 100 = 181500\n       \\]\n\n   - **Calculate \\(605 \\times 2\\):**\n     \\[\n     605 \\times 2 = 1210\n     \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the Results:**\n   - Subtract the result of \\(605 \\times 2\\) from the result of \\(605 \\times 300\\):\n     \\[\n     181500 - 1210 = 180290\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication \\(605 \\times 298\\) is 180290.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication problem 605 * 298 is:\n\n<<<180290>>>"
