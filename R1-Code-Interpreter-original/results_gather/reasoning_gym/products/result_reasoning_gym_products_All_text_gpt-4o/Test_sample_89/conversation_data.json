    "To solve the multiplication problem 84 * 60, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers: 84 and 60.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication**: \n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to simplify the calculation. \n   - Express 60 as 60 = 10 * 6. This allows us to break the multiplication into two parts: 84 * 10 and 84 * 6.\n\n3. **Calculate 84 * 10**:\n   - Multiplying any number by 10 is straightforward: you simply add a zero to the end of the number.\n   - Therefore, 84 * 10 = 840.\n\n4. **Calculate 84 * 6**:\n   - This requires a bit more calculation. We can break it down further if needed, but let's calculate directly:\n   - 84 * 6 can be calculated as follows:\n     - 80 * 6 = 480 (since 8 * 6 = 48, and then add a zero)\n     - 4 * 6 = 24\n   - Add these two results together: 480 + 24 = 504.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Now, add the results of the two separate multiplications:\n   - 840 (from 84 * 10) + 504 (from 84 * 6) = 1344.\n\n6. **Final Result**:\n   - The final result of multiplying 84 by 60 is 1344.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication 84 * 60 is:\n\n<<<1344>>>"
