    "To solve the multiplication problem 523 * 213, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Write the numbers in a column format:**\n   ```\n     523\n   x 213\n   ```\n\n2. **Multiply the bottom number (213) by each digit of the top number (523), starting from the rightmost digit:**\n\n   - **Multiply 523 by 3 (the rightmost digit of 213):**\n     - 3 * 3 = 9\n     - 3 * 2 = 6\n     - 3 * 5 = 15\n     - Result: 1569\n\n   - **Multiply 523 by 1 (the middle digit of 213):**\n     - 1 * 3 = 3\n     - 1 * 2 = 2\n     - 1 * 5 = 5\n     - Result: 523\n     - Since this is the second digit, shift the result one position to the left: 5230\n\n   - **Multiply 523 by 2 (the leftmost digit of 213):**\n     - 2 * 3 = 6\n     - 2 * 2 = 4\n     - 2 * 5 = 10\n     - Result: 1046\n     - Since this is the third digit, shift the result two positions to the left: 104600\n\n3. **Add the results of the multiplications:**\n   ```\n     1569\n    +5230\n   +104600\n   --------\n   ```\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Start from the rightmost column:\n     - 9 (from 1569) + 0 (from 5230) + 0 (from 104600) = 9\n     - 6 (from 1569) + 3 (from 5230) + 0 (from 104600) = 9\n     - 5 (from 1569) + 2 (from 5230) + 6 (from 104600) = 13 (write 3, carry over 1)\n     - 1 (from 1569) + 5 (from 5230) + 4 (from 104600) + 1 (carry over) = 11 (write 1, carry over 1)\n     - 0 (from 1569) + 0 (from 5230) + 0 (from 104600) + 1 (carry over) = 1\n     - 0 (from 1569) + 0 (from 5230) + 1 (from 104600) = 1\n\n   - Final result of the addition: 111399\n\n5. **Enclose the final result within triple angle brackets:**\n\nThe final answer is: <<<111399>>>."
