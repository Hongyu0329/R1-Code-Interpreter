    "To solve the multiplication problem 68 * 67, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This approach will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 68 and 67.\n\n2. **Break Down the Numbers:**\n   - We can express 67 as (70 - 3) to make the multiplication easier.\n\n3. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. We can use this property to simplify the multiplication:\n   - 68 * 67 = 68 * (70 - 3)\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate 68 * 70:\n     - 68 * 70 can be broken down further as 68 * (7 * 10).\n     - First, calculate 68 * 7:\n       - 68 * 7 = (60 + 8) * 7\n       - = (60 * 7) + (8 * 7)\n       - = 420 + 56\n       - = 476\n     - Then, multiply the result by 10:\n       - 476 * 10 = 4760\n\n   - Calculate 68 * 3:\n     - 68 * 3 = (60 + 8) * 3\n     - = (60 * 3) + (8 * 3)\n     - = 180 + 24\n     - = 204\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Now, subtract the result of 68 * 3 from the result of 68 * 70:\n   - 68 * 67 = 68 * 70 - 68 * 3\n   - = 4760 - 204\n   - = 4556\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of multiplying 68 by 67 is 4556.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4556>>>"
