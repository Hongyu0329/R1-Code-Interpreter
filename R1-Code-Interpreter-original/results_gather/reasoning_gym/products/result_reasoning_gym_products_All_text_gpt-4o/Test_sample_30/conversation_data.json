    "To solve the multiplication problem 3 * 7, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 3 and 7.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are adding the number 3 to itself 7 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with the number 3.\n   - Add 3 to itself 7 times:\n     - 3 + 3 = 6\n     - 6 + 3 = 9\n     - 9 + 3 = 12\n     - 12 + 3 = 15\n     - 15 + 3 = 18\n     - 18 + 3 = 21\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the multiplication by using another method, such as repeated addition or using a multiplication table. Both methods should confirm that 3 multiplied by 7 equals 21.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The result of multiplying 3 by 7 is 21.\n\nFinally, we present the answer as requested, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<21>>>"
