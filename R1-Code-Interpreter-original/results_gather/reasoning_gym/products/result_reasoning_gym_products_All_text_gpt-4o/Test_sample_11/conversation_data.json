    "To solve the multiplication problem 812 * 880, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to break down the problem:\n     \\[\n     812 \\times 880 = 812 \\times (800 + 80)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Distribute the Multiplication:**\n   - Distribute 812 to both 800 and 80:\n     \\[\n     812 \\times 880 = (812 \\times 800) + (812 \\times 80)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **Calculate \\(812 \\times 800\\):**\n     - First, calculate \\(812 \\times 8\\):\n       \\[\n       812 \\times 8 = 6496\n       \\]\n     - Then multiply the result by 100 (since 800 is 8 times 100):\n       \\[\n       6496 \\times 100 = 649600\n       \\]\n\n   - **Calculate \\(812 \\times 80\\):**\n     - First, calculate \\(812 \\times 8\\) again (as above):\n       \\[\n       812 \\times 8 = 6496\n       \\]\n     - Then multiply the result by 10 (since 80 is 8 times 10):\n       \\[\n       6496 \\times 10 = 64960\n       \\]\n\n4. **Add the Results:**\n   - Add the two results from the above calculations:\n     \\[\n     649600 + 64960 = 714560\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the multiplication 812 * 880 is 714560.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiplication problem is:\n\n<<<714560>>>"
