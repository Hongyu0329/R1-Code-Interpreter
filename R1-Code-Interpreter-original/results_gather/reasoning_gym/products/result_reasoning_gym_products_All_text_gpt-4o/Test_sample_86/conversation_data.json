    "To solve the multiplication problem 201 * 819, we will break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. This approach will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 201 and 819.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the distributive property of multiplication to simplify the calculation:\n     \\[\n     201 \\times 819 = (200 + 1) \\times 819\n     \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Distributive Property:**\n   - Distribute 819 across the sum (200 + 1):\n     \\[\n     = 200 \\times 819 + 1 \\times 819\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **Calculate \\(200 \\times 819\\):**\n     - Break down further using the distributive property:\n       \\[\n       200 \\times 819 = 200 \\times (800 + 19)\n       \\]\n     - Distribute 200:\n       \\[\n       = 200 \\times 800 + 200 \\times 19\n       \\]\n     - Calculate each term:\n       \\[\n       200 \\times 800 = 160,000\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       200 \\times 19 = 3,800\n       \\]\n     - Add these results:\n       \\[\n       160,000 + 3,800 = 163,800\n       \\]\n\n   - **Calculate \\(1 \\times 819\\):**\n     - This is straightforward:\n       \\[\n       1 \\times 819 = 819\n       \\]\n\n5. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Combine the results from the two parts:\n     \\[\n     163,800 + 819 = 164,619\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of multiplying 201 by 819 is 164,619.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{164,619}\n\\]\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the answer is:\n\n<<<164,619>>>"
