    "To solve the multiplication problem 7 * 0, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Multiplication by Zero**: \n   - Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. \n   - When you multiply any number by zero, you are essentially adding that number zero times, which results in zero.\n\n2. **Applying the Rule**:\n   - According to the multiplication property of zero, any number multiplied by zero equals zero. This is a fundamental property of arithmetic.\n\n3. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   - Given the problem 7 * 0, apply the rule: \n     - Multiply 7 by 0.\n     - Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the result is 0.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Double-checking the rule: No matter what the first number is, if the second number is zero, the result will always be zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The multiplication of 7 by 0 results in 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 7 * 0 is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
