    "To solve the multiplication problem 6 * 7, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 6 and 7.\n\n2. **Recall Basic Multiplication Facts**: Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are adding 6 to itself 7 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Start with 6.\n   - Add 6 to itself: 6 + 6 = 12.\n   - Add another 6: 12 + 6 = 18.\n   - Add another 6: 18 + 6 = 24.\n   - Add another 6: 24 + 6 = 30.\n   - Add another 6: 30 + 6 = 36.\n   - Add another 6: 36 + 6 = 42.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - Alternatively, you can think of 7 * 6, which is the same as 6 * 7 due to the commutative property of multiplication.\n   - You can also verify by breaking it down: (6 * 5) + (6 * 2) = 30 + 12 = 42.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: After verifying the calculation, we confirm that the result of multiplying 6 by 7 is 42.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 6 * 7 is:\n\n<<<42>>>"
