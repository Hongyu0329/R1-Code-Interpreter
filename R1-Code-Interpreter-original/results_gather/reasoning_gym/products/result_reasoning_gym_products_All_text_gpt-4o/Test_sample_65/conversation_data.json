    "To solve the multiplication problem 7095 * 1834, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in our calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 7095 and 1834.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then summing the results appropriately.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit:**\n   - Start by multiplying 7095 by each digit of 1834, beginning from the rightmost digit (units place).\n\n4. **Multiplication by Units Place (4):**\n   - \\( 7095 \\times 4 = 28380 \\)\n\n5. **Multiplication by Tens Place (3):**\n   - \\( 7095 \\times 3 = 21285 \\)\n   - Since this is the tens place, we add a zero to the right: \\( 212850 \\)\n\n6. **Multiplication by Hundreds Place (8):**\n   - \\( 7095 \\times 8 = 56760 \\)\n   - Since this is the hundreds place, we add two zeros to the right: \\( 567600 \\)\n\n7. **Multiplication by Thousands Place (1):**\n   - \\( 7095 \\times 1 = 7095 \\)\n   - Since this is the thousands place, we add three zeros to the right: \\( 7095000 \\)\n\n8. **Add All the Results:**\n   - Now, add all the partial results together:\n     - \\( 28380 \\)\n     - \\( 212850 \\)\n     - \\( 567600 \\)\n     - \\( 7095000 \\)\n\n9. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Align the numbers by their rightmost digits and add them:\n     - \\[\n     \\begin{array}{r}\n     \\phantom{+} 28380 \\\\\n     + 212850 \\\\\n     + 567600 \\\\\n     + 7095000 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     13007830 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n\n10. **Final Result:**\n    - The sum of these numbers gives the final result of the multiplication.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the result of multiplying 7095 by 1834 is 13,007,830.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13007830>>>"
