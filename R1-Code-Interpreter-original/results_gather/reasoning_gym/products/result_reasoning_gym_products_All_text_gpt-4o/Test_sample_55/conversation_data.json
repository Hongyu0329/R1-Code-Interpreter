    "To solve the multiplication problem 79 * 23, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the distributive property of multiplication. This involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then adding the results together. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Break down the numbers**: \n   - 79 can be broken down into 70 and 9.\n   - 23 can be broken down into 20 and 3.\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property**:\n   - Multiply each part of the first number by each part of the second number.\n\n3. **Calculate each multiplication**:\n   - Multiply 70 by 20:\n     - 70 * 20 = 1400\n   - Multiply 70 by 3:\n     - 70 * 3 = 210\n   - Multiply 9 by 20:\n     - 9 * 20 = 180\n   - Multiply 9 by 3:\n     - 9 * 3 = 27\n\n4. **Add all the products together**:\n   - Add the results of the multiplications:\n     - 1400 + 210 + 180 + 27\n\n5. **Perform the addition**:\n   - 1400 + 210 = 1610\n   - 1610 + 180 = 1790\n   - 1790 + 27 = 1817\n\n6. **Final result**:\n   - The result of multiplying 79 by 23 is 1817.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication 79 * 23 is:\n\n<<<1817>>>"
