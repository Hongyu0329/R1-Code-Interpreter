    "To solve the multiplication problem 43921 * 28426, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 43921 and 28426.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of the place values.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit:**\n   - Start with the rightmost digit of the second number (6 in 28426) and multiply it by the entire first number (43921).\n   - Repeat this process for each digit in 28426, shifting one place to the left each time.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Partial Product:**\n   - Multiply 43921 by 6 (units place of 28426).\n   - Multiply 43921 by 2 (tens place of 28426), and shift one place to the left.\n   - Multiply 43921 by 4 (hundreds place of 28426), and shift two places to the left.\n   - Multiply 43921 by 8 (thousands place of 28426), and shift three places to the left.\n   - Multiply 43921 by 2 (ten-thousands place of 28426), and shift four places to the left.\n\n5. **Add the Partial Products:**\n   - Align all the partial products according to their place values and add them together to get the final result.\n\n6. **Perform the Calculations:**\n   - 43921 * 6 = 263526\n   - 43921 * 2 = 87842 (shift one place to the left: 878420)\n   - 43921 * 4 = 175684 (shift two places to the left: 17568400)\n   - 43921 * 8 = 351368 (shift three places to the left: 351368000)\n   - 43921 * 2 = 87842 (shift four places to the left: 878420000)\n\n7. **Sum the Results:**\n   - Add all the shifted partial products:\n     - 263526\n     - 878420\n     - 17568400\n     - 351368000\n     - 878420000\n   - Total sum = 1248995246\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe result of multiplying 43921 by 28426 is:\n\n<<<1248995246>>>"
