    "To solve the multiplication problem 4 * 4, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation**: The problem requires us to perform a multiplication operation. Multiplication is a mathematical operation where a number is added to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we are multiplying 4 by 4.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers involved in this multiplication are both 4. This means we need to add the number 4 to itself 4 times.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**: \n   - Start with the first 4.\n   - Add the second 4: 4 + 4 = 8.\n   - Add the third 4: 8 + 4 = 12.\n   - Add the fourth 4: 12 + 4 = 16.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: To ensure accuracy, let's verify the calculation by considering the multiplication table or using another method:\n   - Using the multiplication table, 4 times 4 is known to be 16.\n   - Alternatively, think of 4 * 4 as 4 groups of 4, which also results in 16.\n\n5. **Conclude the Result**: After performing and verifying the multiplication, we conclude that the result of 4 * 4 is 16.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the multiplication problem 4 * 4 is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
