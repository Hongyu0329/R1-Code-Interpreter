    "To solve the multiplication problem 545 * 352, we will break it down into smaller, more manageable steps using the standard multiplication algorithm. This involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then adding the results appropriately.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Write the numbers in a column format:**\n   ```\n     545\n   x 352\n   ------\n   ```\n\n2. **Multiply the bottom number (352) by each digit of the top number (545), starting from the rightmost digit:**\n\n   - **Multiply 545 by 2 (the rightmost digit of 352):**\n     - 545 * 2 = 1090\n     - Write 1090 below the line, aligned to the right.\n     ```\n       545\n     x 352\n     ------\n      1090  (545 * 2)\n     ```\n\n   - **Multiply 545 by 5 (the middle digit of 352):**\n     - 545 * 5 = 2725\n     - Write 2725 below 1090, shifted one position to the left (since it's the tens place).\n     ```\n       545\n     x 352\n     ------\n      1090  (545 * 2)\n     2725   (545 * 5, shifted one position left)\n     ```\n\n   - **Multiply 545 by 3 (the leftmost digit of 352):**\n     - 545 * 3 = 1635\n     - Write 1635 below 2725, shifted two positions to the left (since it's the hundreds place).\n     ```\n       545\n     x 352\n     ------\n      1090  (545 * 2)\n     2725   (545 * 5, shifted one position left)\n    1635    (545 * 3, shifted two positions left)\n     ```\n\n3. **Add the results of the multiplications:**\n   - Align the numbers by their rightmost digits and add them together.\n   ```\n       1090\n      2725 \n     1635  \n     ------\n     191840\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The sum of the products is 191840.\n\nTherefore, the result of multiplying 545 by 352 is:\n\n<<<191840>>>"
