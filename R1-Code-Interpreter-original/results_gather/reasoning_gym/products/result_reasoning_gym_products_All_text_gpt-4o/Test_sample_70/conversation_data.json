    "To solve the multiplication problem 56955 * 32241, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 56955 and 32241.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of the place values.\n\n3. **Multiply Each Digit:**\n   - Start with the rightmost digit of the second number (1 in 32241) and multiply it by the entire first number (56955).\n   - Then, move to the next digit (4 in 32241), multiply it by 56955, and shift one position to the left (i.e., multiply by 10).\n   - Continue this process for each digit in 32241.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Partial Product:**\n   - Multiply 56955 by 1 (rightmost digit of 32241):\n     - 56955 * 1 = 56955\n   - Multiply 56955 by 4 (next digit of 32241), and shift one position to the left:\n     - 56955 * 4 = 227820 (shifted one position: 2278200)\n   - Multiply 56955 by 2 (next digit of 32241), and shift two positions to the left:\n     - 56955 * 2 = 113910 (shifted two positions: 11391000)\n   - Multiply 56955 by 2 (next digit of 32241), and shift three positions to the left:\n     - 56955 * 2 = 113910 (shifted three positions: 113910000)\n   - Multiply 56955 by 3 (leftmost digit of 32241), and shift four positions to the left:\n     - 56955 * 3 = 170865 (shifted four positions: 1708650000)\n\n5. **Sum All Partial Products:**\n   - Add all the partial products together:\n     - 56955\n     - 2278200\n     - 11391000\n     - 113910000\n     - 1708650000\n\n6. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Align all numbers by their rightmost digits and add them:\n     - 0000056955\n     - 0002278200\n     - 0011391000\n     - 0113910000\n     - 1708650000\n   - Sum these values:\n     - 1834979655\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter performing the calculations and summing the partial products, the result of multiplying 56955 by 32241 is:\n\n<<<1834979655>>>"
