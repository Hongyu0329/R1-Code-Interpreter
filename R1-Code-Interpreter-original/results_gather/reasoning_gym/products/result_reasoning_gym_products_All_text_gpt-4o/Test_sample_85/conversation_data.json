    "To solve the multiplication problem 31 * 36, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers, 31 and 36.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication**: We can use the distributive property to make the multiplication easier. The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. We can apply this to our problem:\n\n   - Break down 36 into 30 + 6.\n   - So, 31 * 36 becomes 31 * (30 + 6).\n\n3. **Apply the Distributive Property**: \n\n   - First, multiply 31 by 30:\n     - 31 * 30 = 31 * (3 * 10) = (31 * 3) * 10.\n     - Calculate 31 * 3:\n       - 31 * 3 = 93.\n     - Multiply the result by 10:\n       - 93 * 10 = 930.\n\n   - Next, multiply 31 by 6:\n     - 31 * 6 = 186.\n\n4. **Add the Results**: Now, add the two products obtained from the distributive property:\n\n   - 930 (from 31 * 30) + 186 (from 31 * 6) = 1116.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check each step to ensure accuracy:\n\n   - 31 * 3 = 93 is correct.\n   - 93 * 10 = 930 is correct.\n   - 31 * 6 = 186 is correct.\n   - 930 + 186 = 1116 is correct.\n\n6. **Final Result**: The result of multiplying 31 by 36 is 1116.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1116>>>"
