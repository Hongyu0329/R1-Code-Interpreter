    "To solve the multiplication problem 82389 * 31225, we will break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. This will help ensure accuracy and clarity in the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to multiply two numbers: 82389 and 31225.\n\n2. **Break Down the Multiplication:**\n   - We can use the standard long multiplication method, which involves multiplying each digit of the second number by the entire first number and then summing the results, taking care of the place values.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply 82389 by each digit of 31225, starting from the rightmost digit (units place) and moving to the left (tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten-thousands places).\n\n4. **Calculate Each Partial Product:**\n   - Multiply 82389 by 5 (units place of 31225).\n   - Multiply 82389 by 2 (tens place of 31225), and shift one position to the left.\n   - Multiply 82389 by 2 (hundreds place of 31225), and shift two positions to the left.\n   - Multiply 82389 by 1 (thousands place of 31225), and shift three positions to the left.\n   - Multiply 82389 by 3 (ten-thousands place of 31225), and shift four positions to the left.\n\n5. **Add the Partial Products:**\n   - Align all the partial products according to their place values and add them together to get the final result.\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Double-check each step to ensure there are no errors in multiplication or addition.\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\n- **Partial Products:**\n  - \\( 82389 \\times 5 = 411945 \\)\n  - \\( 82389 \\times 2 = 164778 \\) (shifted one position to the left: 1647780)\n  - \\( 82389 \\times 2 = 164778 \\) (shifted two positions to the left: 16477800)\n  - \\( 82389 \\times 1 = 82389 \\) (shifted three positions to the left: 82389000)\n  - \\( 82389 \\times 3 = 247167 \\) (shifted four positions to the left: 2471670000)\n\n- **Sum of Partial Products:**\n  - Align and add:\n    - \\( 411945 \\)\n    - \\( 1647780 \\)\n    - \\( 16477800 \\)\n    - \\( 82389000 \\)\n    - \\( 2471670000 \\)\n  - Total: \\( 2572039725 \\)\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe result of multiplying 82389 by 31225 is:\n\n<<<2572039725>>>"
