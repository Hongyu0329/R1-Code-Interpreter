    "To solve the multiplication problem 3 * 7, I will perform the calculation directly. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation, and I can use Python to compute it efficiently.\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to perform this multiplication:\n\n```python\nresult = 3 * 7\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the product of 3 and 7 and print the result. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following multiplication: 3 * 7.
