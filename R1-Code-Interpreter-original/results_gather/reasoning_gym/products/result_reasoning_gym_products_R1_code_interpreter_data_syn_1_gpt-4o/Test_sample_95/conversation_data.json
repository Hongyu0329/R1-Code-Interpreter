    "To solve the multiplication problem 86086 * 83931, I will use Python to perform the calculation. This will ensure accuracy and efficiency in obtaining the result. Let's write a simple Python script to compute this multiplication.\n\n```python\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = 86086 * 83931\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, I will execute this code to get the result.",
    "The multiplication of 86086 and 83931 results in 7225284066. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7225284066>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following multiplication: 86086 * 83931.
