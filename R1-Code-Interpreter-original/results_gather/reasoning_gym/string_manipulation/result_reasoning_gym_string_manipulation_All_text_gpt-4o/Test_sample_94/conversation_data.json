    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the transformation rules to the string \"ccbaca\" step by step, following the order of the rules. We will continue applying the rules until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"ccbaca\"\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Rule 1: The string does not end with 'aa'.\n   - Rule 2: The string does not start with 'aa'.\n   - Rule 3: The string does not start with 'ca'.\n   - Rule 4: The string starts with 'cb'. Apply Rule 4: Replace 'cb' with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n     - New String: \"aabac\"\n\n3. **New String**: \"aabac\"\n\n4. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Rule 1: The string does not end with 'aa'.\n   - Rule 2: The string starts with 'aa'. Apply Rule 2: Remove the first character.\n     - New String: \"abac\"\n\n5. **New String**: \"abac\"\n\n6. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Rule 1: The string does not end with 'aa'.\n   - Rule 2: The string does not start with 'aa'.\n   - Rule 3: The string does not start with 'ca'.\n   - Rule 4: The string does not start with 'cb'.\n   - Rule 5: The string does not start with 'ac'.\n   - Rule 6: The string ends with 'ac'. Apply Rule 6: Replace 'ac' with 'cb'.\n     - New String: \"abcb\"\n\n7. **New String**: \"abcb\"\n\n8. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Rule 1: The string does not end with 'aa'.\n   - Rule 2: The string does not start with 'aa'.\n   - Rule 3: The string does not start with 'ca'.\n   - Rule 4: The string starts with 'cb'. Apply Rule 4: Replace 'cb' with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n     - New String: \"abaa\"\n\n9. **New String**: \"abaa\"\n\n10. **Apply Rules**:\n    - Rule 1: The string does not end with 'aa'.\n    - Rule 2: The string does not start with 'aa'.\n    - Rule 3: The string does not start with 'ca'.\n    - Rule 4: The string does not start with 'cb'.\n    - Rule 5: The string does not start with 'ac'.\n    - Rule 6: The string does not end with 'ac'.\n\nSince no rules apply to the string \"abaa\" and no state is repeated, the transformation process stops here.\n\nThe final transformed string is: <<<abaa>>>"
