    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"abbcaaacbbcca\" step by step, ensuring that we follow the order of the rules and repeat the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String:** \"abbcaaacbbcca\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:** The string starts with \"bb\" after the first character \"a\", so we remove the second character of \"bb\".\n   - Result: \"abcaacbbcca\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2:** The string contains \"ca\" after the first character. Remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"abacbbcca\"\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3:** The string contains \"abc\". Replace the first occurrence with \"cab\".\n   - Result: \"cabacbbcca\"\n\n5. **Apply Rule 1:** The string starts with \"bb\" after the first character \"c\", so we remove the second character of \"bb\".\n   - Result: \"cabacbcca\"\n\n6. **Apply Rule 2:** The string contains \"ca\" after the first character. Remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"cabcbcca\"\n\n7. **Apply Rule 3:** The string contains \"abc\". Replace the first occurrence with \"cab\".\n   - Result: \"cabcbcca\" (No change, as \"abc\" is not present)\n\n8. **Apply Rule 4:** The string ends with \"ca\". Remove the last character.\n   - Result: \"cabcbcc\"\n\n9. **Apply Rule 1:** The string does not start with \"bb\".\n   - No change.\n\n10. **Apply Rule 2:** The string does not contain \"ca\" after the first character.\n    - No change.\n\n11. **Apply Rule 3:** The string does not contain \"abc\".\n    - No change.\n\n12. **Apply Rule 4:** The string does not end with \"ca\".\n    - No change.\n\nSince no further transformations can be applied and no state is repeated, the process terminates here.\n\nThe final transformed string is: <<<cabcbcc>>>"
