    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"bccbccbcbca\" step by step, ensuring that we follow the order of the rules and stop when no further transformations can be applied or a state is repeated.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"bccbccbcbca\"\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - The string does not start with 'ca', so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'cc', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'cb', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\nSince none of the rules apply to the initial string, we need to check if any transformations can be applied to subsequent parts of the string by moving through it:\n\n3. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - The string starts with 'b', so we move to the next character.\n   - The substring \"cc\" is found starting at the second character, so Rule 2 applies: remove the first two characters.\n   - New String: \"cbcbcbca\"\n\n4. **Apply Rules to New String**: \"cbcbcbca\"\n   - The string starts with 'cb', so Rule 3 applies: replace 'cb' with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - New String: \"aabcbcbc\"\n\n5. **Apply Rules to New String**: \"aabcbcbc\"\n   - The string does not start with 'ca', so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'cc', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'cb', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\n6. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - The string starts with 'a', so we move to the next character.\n   - The substring \"cb\" is found starting at the third character, so Rule 3 applies: replace 'cb' with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - New String: \"aaaaaabc\"\n\n7. **Apply Rules to New String**: \"aaaaaabc\"\n   - The string does not start with 'ca', so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'cc', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'cb', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\n8. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - The string starts with 'a', so we move to the next character.\n   - The string continues with 'a', so we move to the next character.\n   - The string continues with 'a', so we move to the next character.\n   - The string continues with 'a', so we move to the next character.\n   - The string continues with 'a', so we move to the next character.\n   - The substring \"bc\" is found starting at the sixth character, but no rules apply to \"bc\".\n\nSince no further transformations can be applied and no state is repeated, the final transformed string is \"aaaaaabc\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<aaaaaabc>>>"
