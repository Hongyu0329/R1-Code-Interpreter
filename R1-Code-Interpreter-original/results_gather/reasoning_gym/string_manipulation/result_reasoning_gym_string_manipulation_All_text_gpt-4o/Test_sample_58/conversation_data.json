If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n2. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n3.

    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"cabcccbcbbc\" step by step, in the specified order, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze and apply each rule carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cabcccbcbbc\"\n\n2. **Rule 1**: If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - The string \"cabcccbcbbc\" does not contain 'abc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **Rule 2**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n   - The string \"cabcccbcbbc\" does not end with 'aa', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n4. **Rule 3**: If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.\n   - The string \"cabcccbcbbc\" does not start with 'ac', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **Rule 4**: If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n   - The string \"cabcccbcbbc\" does not start with 'cc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n6. **Rule 5**: If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - The string \"cabcccbcbbc\" does not start with 'bc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\nSince none of the rules are applicable to the initial string \"cabcccbcbbc\", no transformation can be performed. Therefore, the final transformed string is the same as the initial string.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<cabcccbcbbc>>>"
