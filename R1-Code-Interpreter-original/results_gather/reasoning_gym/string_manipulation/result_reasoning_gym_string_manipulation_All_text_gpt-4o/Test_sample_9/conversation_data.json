  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n2. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.\n3. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n4. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nbaabccbcbbccaacab\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"baabccbcbbccaacab\" step by step, ensuring that we follow the order of the rules and repeat the process until no further transformations can be applied or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"baabccbcbbccaacab\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 4**: The string contains \"abc\", so replace the first occurrence with \"cab\".\n   - New String: \"bacbccbcbbccaacab\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 4**: The string contains \"abc\", so replace the first occurrence with \"cab\".\n   - New String: \"bacbccbcbbccacab\"\n\n4. **Apply Rule 4**: The string contains \"abc\", so replace the first occurrence with \"cab\".\n   - New String: \"bacbccbcbbccacba\"\n\n5. **Apply Rule 2**: The string ends with \"ba\", so replace it with \"ab\".\n   - New String: \"bacbccbcbbccacab\"\n\n6. **Apply Rule 4**: The string contains \"abc\", so replace the first occurrence with \"cab\".\n   - New String: \"bacbccbcbbccacba\"\n\n7. **Apply Rule 2**: The string ends with \"ba\", so replace it with \"ab\".\n   - New String: \"bacbccbcbbccacab\"\n\nAt this point, we notice that the string \"bacbccbcbbccacab\" is repeating, indicating that we have reached a cycle. According to the problem, we discard the repeated state and consider the state before the repetition as the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the final transformed string is:\n\n<<<bacbccbcbbccacba>>>"
