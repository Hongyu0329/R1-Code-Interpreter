    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"aacbaca\" step by step, in the specified order, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"aacbaca\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 4**: The string contains \"acb\", so replace the first occurrence with \"bca\".\n   - Result: \"aabcaca\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 5**: The string contains \"ca\" (not at the start), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"aabca\"\n\n4. **Apply Rule 5**: The string still contains \"ca\" (not at the start), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - Result: \"aaba\"\n\n5. **No applicable rules**: The string \"aaba\" does not match any of the rules. Therefore, no further transformations can be performed.\n\nSince no further transformations can be applied and no state is repeated, the final transformed string is \"aaba\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<aaba>>>"
