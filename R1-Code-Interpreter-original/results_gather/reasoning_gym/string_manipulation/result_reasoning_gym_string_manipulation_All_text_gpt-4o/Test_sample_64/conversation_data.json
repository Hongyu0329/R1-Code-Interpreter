    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"bcbaabacaabcbabb\" step by step, in the specified order, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String:** `bcbaabacaabcbabb`\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:** The string contains 'abc', so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: `bcbaabacaacbabbb`\n\n3. **Apply Rule 1:** The string contains 'abc', so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: `bcbaabacaacbabbb` (No change, as 'abc' is not found)\n\n4. **Apply Rule 2:** The string prefix is 'cb', so replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - New String: `baaabacaacbabbb`\n\n5. **Apply Rule 1:** The string contains 'abc', so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: `baacabacaacbabbb`\n\n6. **Apply Rule 3:** The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: `baabacaacbabbb`\n\n7. **Apply Rule 1:** The string contains 'abc', so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: `baacabacbabbb`\n\n8. **Apply Rule 3:** The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: `baabacbabbb`\n\n9. **Apply Rule 1:** The string contains 'abc', so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: `baacabbb`\n\n10. **Apply Rule 3:** The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n    - New String: `baabbb`\n\n11. **Apply Rule 1:** The string contains 'abc', so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n    - New String: `baabbb` (No change, as 'abc' is not found)\n\n12. **Apply Rule 2:** The string prefix is 'cb', so replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n    - New String: `baabbb` (No change, as 'cb' is not at the start)\n\n13. **Apply Rule 3:** The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n    - New String: `baabbb` (No change, as 'ca' is not found)\n\n14. **Apply Rule 4:** The string prefix is 'ab', so replace it with 'ca'.\n    - New String: `baabbb` (No change, as 'ab' is not at the start)\n\n15. **Apply Rule 5:** The string ends with 'aa', so replace it with 'cc'.\n    - New String: `baabbb` (No change, as the string does not end with 'aa')\n\nSince no further transformations can be applied and no state is repeated, the process terminates here.\n\nThe final transformed string is: <<<baabbb>>>"
