  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n2. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n3. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.\n4. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.\n5. If the string contains an even number of 'b's (and at least one 'b'), append 'ab' at the end.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\ncacbcbbaa\n",

    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the transformation rules to the string \"cacbcbbaa\" step by step, following the order of the rules and repeating the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cacbcbbaa\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 2**: The string starts with \"ca\", so we replace \"ca\" with \"bb\" and append \"c\" to the end.\n   - New String: \"bbcbbbaac\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 5**: The string \"bbcbbbaac\" contains an even number of 'b's (6 'b's), so we append \"ab\" to the end.\n   - New String: \"bbcbbbaacab\"\n\n4. **Apply Rule 4**: The string ends with \"ba\", so we replace \"ba\" with \"ab\".\n   - New String: \"bbcbbbaacab\"\n\n5. **Apply Rule 5**: The string \"bbcbbbaacab\" contains an even number of 'b's (6 'b's), so we append \"ab\" to the end.\n   - New String: \"bbcbbbaacab\"\n\n6. **Check for Repetition**: The string \"bbcbbbaacab\" is the same as the previous state, indicating a repeated state. According to the problem, we discard the repeated state and consider the state before the repetition as the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the final transformed string is \"bbcbbbaacab\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<bbcbbbaacab>>>"
