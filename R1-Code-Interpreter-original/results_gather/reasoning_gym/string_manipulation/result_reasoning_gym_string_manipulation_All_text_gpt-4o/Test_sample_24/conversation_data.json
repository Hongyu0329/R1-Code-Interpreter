    "To transform the string \"bccbc\" according to the given rules, we need to apply the rules in the specified order and repeat the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"bccbc\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 4**: The string starts with \"bc\", so we delete the first two characters and append \"aa\" to the end.\n   - Resulting String: \"cbaa\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 3**: The string starts with \"cc\", but \"cbaa\" does not start with \"cc\", so this rule is not applicable.\n\n4. **Apply Rule 6**: The string ends with \"aa\", so we replace it with \"cc\".\n   - Resulting String: \"cbcc\"\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4**: The string starts with \"bc\", but \"cbcc\" does not start with \"bc\", so this rule is not applicable.\n\n6. **Apply Rule 3**: The string starts with \"cc\", but \"cbcc\" does not start with \"cc\", so this rule is not applicable.\n\n7. **Apply Rule 2**: The string ends with \"bb\", but \"cbcc\" does not end with \"bb\", so this rule is not applicable.\n\n8. **Apply Rule 5**: The string ends with \"ba\", but \"cbcc\" does not end with \"ba\", so this rule is not applicable.\n\n9. **Apply Rule 1**: The string prefix is \"aa\", but \"cbcc\" does not start with \"aa\", so this rule is not applicable.\n\n10. **No Further Transformations**: Since no rules are applicable, the transformation process stops here.\n\nThe final transformed string is \"cbcc\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<cbcc>>>"
