    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"ccaaacbbcbcc\" step by step, in the specified order, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze and apply each rule carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String:** \"ccaaacbbcbcc\"\n\n2. **Rule 3:** The string starts with 'cc', so we remove the first two characters.\n   - New String: \"aaacbbcbcc\"\n\n3. **Rule 1:** The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so we remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: \"aaabbcbcc\"\n\n4. **Rule 5:** The string contains 'abc', so we replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"aaacbbcbcc\"\n\n5. **Rule 1:** The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so we remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: \"aaabbcbcc\"\n\n6. **Rule 5:** The string contains 'abc', so we replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"aaacbbcbcc\"\n\n7. **Rule 1:** The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so we remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: \"aaabbcbcc\"\n\n8. **Rule 5:** The string contains 'abc', so we replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"aaacbbcbcc\"\n\nAt this point, we notice that the string \"aaacbbcbcc\" is repeating, indicating a cycle. According to the problem, if a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded. The state before the repeated state is considered the final answer.\n\nThe state before the repeated state is \"aaabbcbcc\".\n\nTherefore, the final transformed string is:\n\n<<<aaabbcbcc>>>"
