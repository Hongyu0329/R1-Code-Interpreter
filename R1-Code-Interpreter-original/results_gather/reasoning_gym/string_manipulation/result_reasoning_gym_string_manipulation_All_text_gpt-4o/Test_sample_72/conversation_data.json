    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"acabb\" step by step, ensuring that we follow the order of the rules and stop when no further transformations can be applied or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"acabb\"\n\n2. **Check Rule 1**: The prefix is \"ac\", not \"cb\", so Rule 1 does not apply.\n\n3. **Check Rule 2**: The prefix is \"ac\", not \"ab\", so Rule 2 does not apply.\n\n4. **Check Rule 3**: The prefix is \"ac\", not \"ca\", so Rule 3 does not apply.\n\nSince none of the rules apply to the initial string \"acabb\", the string remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Final Check**: Since no transformations were applied, and the string did not change, the process terminates here.\n\nThe final transformed string is the same as the initial string because no rules were applicable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<acabb>>>"
