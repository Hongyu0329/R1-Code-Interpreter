    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"acbcacc\" step by step, ensuring that we follow the order of the rules and repeat the process until no further transformations can be applied or a state is repeated. Let's analyze the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"acbcacc\"\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - **Rule 1**: The string does not end with 'ba', so this rule is not applicable.\n   - **Rule 2**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence of 'bca'. The string becomes \"accc\".\n   - **Rule 3**: The string does not start with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n   - **Rule 4**: The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **New String**: \"accc\"\n\n4. **Apply Rules Again**:\n   - **Rule 1**: The string does not end with 'ba', so this rule is not applicable.\n   - **Rule 2**: The string does not contain 'bca', so this rule is not applicable.\n   - **Rule 3**: The string does not start with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n   - **Rule 4**: The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **No Further Transformations**: Since no rules can be applied to the string \"accc\", and no state is repeated, the process terminates here.\n\nThe final transformed string is \"accc\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<accc>>>"
