    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"aabbcbacaa\" step by step, ensuring that we follow the order of the rules and repeat the process until no further transformations can be applied or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"aabbcbacaa\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1**: Check for 'abc' in the string.\n   - The string contains 'abc' starting at index 3 (\"aabb**abc**aa\").\n   - Replace 'abc' with 'cab': \"aabbcabaa\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 1 Again**: Check for 'abc' in the new string.\n   - The string contains 'abc' starting at index 4 (\"aabbc**abc**a\").\n   - Replace 'abc' with 'cab': \"aabbccaba\"\n\n4. **Apply Rule 2**: Check if the prefix is 'ca'.\n   - The string does not start with 'ca', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n\n5. **Apply Rule 3**: Check if the suffix is 'bb'.\n   - The string does not end with 'bb', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\n6. **Apply Rule 1 Again**: Check for 'abc' in the string.\n   - The string does not contain 'abc', so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n\n7. **Apply Rule 2 Again**: Check if the prefix is 'ca'.\n   - The string does not start with 'ca', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n\n8. **Apply Rule 3 Again**: Check if the suffix is 'bb'.\n   - The string does not end with 'bb', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\nSince no rules can be applied anymore and no state is repeated, the process terminates here.\n\nThe final transformed string is: <<<aabbccaba>>>"
