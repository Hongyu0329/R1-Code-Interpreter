    "To transform the string \"caccabb\" according to the given rules, we will apply the rules step by step until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"caccabb\"\n\n2. **Rule Evaluation**:\n   - Rule 1: The string does not start with 'bb'.\n   - Rule 2: The string does not start with 'ac'.\n   - Rule 3: The string length is not greater than 15.\n   - Rule 4: The string does not contain 'abc'.\n   - Rule 5: The string prefix is not 'aa'.\n   - Rule 6: The string suffix is 'bb'. Apply this rule: remove the last two characters.\n     - New String: \"cacca\"\n\n3. **New String**: \"cacca\"\n\n4. **Rule Evaluation**:\n   - Rule 1: The string does not start with 'bb'.\n   - Rule 2: The string does not start with 'ac'.\n   - Rule 3: The string length is not greater than 15.\n   - Rule 4: The string does not contain 'abc'.\n   - Rule 5: The string prefix is not 'aa'.\n   - Rule 6: The string suffix is not 'bb'.\n   - Rule 7: The string does not contain 'bca'.\n   - Rule 8: The string prefix is 'ca'. Apply this rule: replace 'ca' with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n     - New String: \"bbccac\"\n\n5. **New String**: \"bbccac\"\n\n6. **Rule Evaluation**:\n   - Rule 1: The string starts with 'bb'. Apply this rule: remove the second character.\n     - New String: \"bccac\"\n\n7. **New String**: \"bccac\"\n\n8. **Rule Evaluation**:\n   - Rule 1: The string does not start with 'bb'.\n   - Rule 2: The string does not start with 'ac'.\n   - Rule 3: The string length is not greater than 15.\n   - Rule 4: The string does not contain 'abc'.\n   - Rule 5: The string prefix is not 'aa'.\n   - Rule 6: The string suffix is not 'bb'.\n   - Rule 7: The string does not contain 'bca'.\n   - Rule 8: The string prefix is not 'ca'.\n\nSince no rules apply to the string \"bccac\" and no state is repeated, the transformation process is complete.\n\nThe final transformed string is: <<<bccac>>>"
