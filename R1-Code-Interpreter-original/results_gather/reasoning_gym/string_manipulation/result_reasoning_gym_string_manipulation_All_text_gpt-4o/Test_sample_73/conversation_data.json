    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"caabccbbabaaacbb\" step by step, in the specified order, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze and apply each rule carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"caabccbbabaaacbb\"\n\n2. **Rule 1**: If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n   - The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **Rule 2**: If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n   - The string contains 'acb' at position 12-14. Replace 'acb' with 'bca'.\n   - New string: \"caabccbbabaabcb\"\n\n4. **Rule 3**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - The string does not start with 'bb', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **Rule 4**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n   - The string does not end with 'aa', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n6. **Repeat the process with the new string**: \"caabccbbabaabcb\"\n\n7. **Rule 1**: The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n8. **Rule 2**: The string contains 'acb' at position 12-14. Replace 'acb' with 'bca'.\n   - New string: \"caabccbbabaabcb\"\n\n9. **Rule 3**: The string does not start with 'bb', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n10. **Rule 4**: The string does not end with 'aa', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n11. **Repeat the process with the new string**: \"caabccbbabaabcb\"\n\n12. **Rule 1**: The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n13. **Rule 2**: The string contains 'acb' at position 12-14. Replace 'acb' with 'bca'.\n    - New string: \"caabccbbabaabcb\"\n\n14. **Check for repeated state**: The string \"caabccbbabaabcb\" is the same as the previous state before the last transformation, indicating a repeated state.\n\n15. **Terminate the process**: Since a repeated state is detected, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded. The state before the repeated state is considered the final answer.\n\nThe final transformed string is: <<<caabccbbabaabcb>>>"
