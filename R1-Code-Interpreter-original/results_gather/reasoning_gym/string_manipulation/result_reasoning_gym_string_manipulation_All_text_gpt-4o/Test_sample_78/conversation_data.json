    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"cabbcbcccacbcbcaa\" step by step, in the specified order, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze and apply each rule carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cabbcbcccacbcbcaa\"\n\n2. **Rule 4**: The string starts with 'ab', so replace 'ab' with 'ca'.\n   - New String: \"cacbcbcccacbcbcaa\"\n\n3. **Rule 7**: The string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with 'bca'.\n   - New String: \"cbcbcccacbcbcaa\"\n\n4. **Rule 2**: The string starts with 'cb', replace 'cb' with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n   - New String: \"aabcbcccacbcbca\"\n\n5. **Rule 6**: The string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - New String: \"aabcccacbcbca\"\n\n6. **Rule 7**: The string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with 'bca'.\n   - New String: \"aabcccbcabca\"\n\n7. **Rule 6**: The string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - New String: \"aabcccca\"\n\n8. **No applicable rules**: The string \"aabcccca\" does not match any of the rules, so no further transformations can be performed.\n\nSince no further transformations can be applied and no state is repeated, the final transformed string is \"aabcccca\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<aabcccca>>>"
