    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"ccbaabaabaacaccaccbb\" step by step, ensuring that we follow the order of the rules and stop when no further transformations can be applied or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String:** \"ccbaabaabaacaccaccbb\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 2:** The suffix is \"cc\", so replace it with \"b\" and prepend \"a\" to the start.\n   - New String: \"accbaabaabaacaccaccb\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2:** The suffix is \"cc\", so replace it with \"b\" and prepend \"a\" to the start.\n   -
