  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.\n2. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n3. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n4. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n5. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nacbcabaaccaac\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"acbcabaaccaac\" step by step, in the specified order, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"acbcabaaccaac\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1**: The string length is 13, which is not greater than 15, so Rule 1 does not apply.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2**: The string prefix is \"ac\", not \"aa\", so Rule 2 does not apply.\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3**: The string prefix is \"ac\", not \"cb\", so Rule 3 does not apply.\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4**: The string ends with \"aac\", not \"aa\", so Rule 4 does not apply.\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5**: The string starts with \"ac\", not \"bb\", so Rule 5 does not apply.\n\nSince none of the rules apply to the initial string, no transformation occurs. Therefore, the process terminates immediately as no further transformations can be performed.\n\nThe final transformed string is the same as the initial string, as no rules were applicable.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<acbcabaaccaac>>>"
