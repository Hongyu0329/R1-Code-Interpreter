    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the transformation rules to the string \"ccbabaa\" step by step, following the order of the rules. We will continue applying the rules until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String:** \"ccbabaa\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:** The string does not end with 'ba', so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2:** The string starts with 'cc', so we replace 'cc' with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n   -
