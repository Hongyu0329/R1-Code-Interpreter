    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the transformation rules to the string \"cabcaccaaccc\" step by step, in the order given, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"cabcaccaaccc\"\n\n2. **Rule 1**: Check for 'bca'. The string contains 'bca' starting at index 1. Remove 'bca'.\n   - New String: \"ccaccaaccc\"\n\n3. **Rule 4**: Check if the string starts with 'cc'. The string does start with 'cc'. Remove the first two characters.\n   - New String: \"accaaccc\"\n\n4. **Rule 6**: Check for 'ca' not at the start. The string contains 'ca' starting at index 2. Remove 'ca'.\n   - New String: \"acaccc\"\n\n5. **Rule 6**: Check for 'ca' not at the start. The string contains 'ca' starting at index 1. Remove 'ca'.\n   - New String: \"accc\"\n\n6. **No further rules apply**: \n   - Rule 1: No 'bca' in the string.\n   - Rule 2: String length is not greater than 15.\n   - Rule 3: String does not start with 'bc'.\n   - Rule 4: String does not start with 'cc'.\n   - Rule 5: String does not end with 'ba'.\n   - Rule 6: No 'ca' after the first character.\n   - Rule 7: String does not end with 'ac'.\n\nSince no further transformations can be applied and no state is repeated, the final transformed string is \"accc\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<accc>>>"
