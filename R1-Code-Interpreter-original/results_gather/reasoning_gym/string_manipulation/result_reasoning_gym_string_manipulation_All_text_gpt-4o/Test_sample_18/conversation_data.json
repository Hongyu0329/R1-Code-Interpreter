    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"bbcacbbacbaccaababba\" step by step, in the specified order, until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Initial String:** bbcacbbacbaccaababba\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:** The string starts with 'bc', so we delete 'bc' and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - New String: cacbbacbaccaababbaaa\n\n3. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n   - New String: cacbbacbaccaababbaa\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n   - New String: cacbbacbaccaababba\n\n5. **Apply Rule 2:** The string ends with 'ba', so we replace it with 'ab'.\n   - New String: cacbbacbaccaababab\n\n6. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n   - New String: cacbbacbaccaababa\n\n7. **Apply Rule 2:** The string ends with 'ba', so we replace it with 'ab'.\n   - New String: cacbbacbaccaabaab\n\n8. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n   - New String: cacbbacbaccaaba\n\n9. **Apply Rule 2:** The string ends with 'ba', so we replace it with 'ab'.\n   - New String: cacbbacbaccaab\n\n10. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cacbbacbaccaa\n\n11. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cacbbacbacca\n\n12. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cacbbacbac\n\n13. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cacbbacba\n\n14. **Apply Rule 2:** The string ends with 'ba', so we replace it with 'ab'.\n    - New String: cacbbacab\n\n15. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cacbbaca\n\n16. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cacbbac\n\n17. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cacbba\n\n18. **Apply Rule 2:** The string ends with 'ba', so we replace it with 'ab'.\n    - New String: cacbab\n\n19. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cacba\n\n20. **Apply Rule 2:** The string ends with 'ba', so we replace it with 'ab'.\n    - New String: cacab\n\n21. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: cac\n\n22. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: ca\n\n23. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n    - New String: c\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied, and the transformation process is complete. The final transformed string is:\n\n<<<c>>>"
