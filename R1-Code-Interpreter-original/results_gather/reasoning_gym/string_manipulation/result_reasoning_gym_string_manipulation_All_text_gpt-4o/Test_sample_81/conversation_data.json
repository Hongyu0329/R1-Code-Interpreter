If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n2. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n3. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n4. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n5. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n6. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n7. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nccbab\n",

    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the transformation rules to the string \"ccbab\" step by step, following the order of the rules. We will continue applying the rules until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's analyze the process:\n\n1. **Initial String:** \"ccbab\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:** The string starts with 'cc', so we remove the first two characters.\n   - New String: \"bab\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 4:** The string prefix is 'ab', so we replace it with 'ca'.\n   - New String: \"cab\"\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n   - New String: \"ca\"\n\n5. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'ca', so we remove the last character.\n   - New String: \"c\"\n\n6. **No rules apply to the string \"c\".** Therefore, no further transformations can be performed.\n\nSince no further transformations can be applied and no state is repeated, the final transformed string is \"c\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<c>>>"
