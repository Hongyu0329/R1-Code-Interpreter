  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n2. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n3. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.\n4. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n5. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n6. If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nccbacccca\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"ccbacccca\" in the specified order until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"ccbacccca\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 6**: The string starts with 'cc', so we remove the first two characters.\n   - New String: \"bacccca\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 1**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - New String: \"ccca\"\n\n4. **Apply Rule 6**: The string starts with 'cc', so we remove the first two characters.\n   - New String: \"ca\"\n\n5. **Apply Rule 5**: The string prefix is 'ca', so we replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - New String: \"bbc\"\n\n6. **No Rule Applies**: None of the rules apply to \"bbc\", so the transformation process stops here.\n\nThe final transformed string is \"bbc\".
