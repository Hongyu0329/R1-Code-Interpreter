    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"bcabbc\" in the specified order until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated.

The string becomes \"bbc\".\n   - Rule 7: The string does not start with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n   - Rule 8: The string length is not greater than 15, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **New String**: \"bbc\"\n\n4. **Apply Rules Again**:\n   - Rule 1: The string ends with 'bb', so we delete the last two characters.
