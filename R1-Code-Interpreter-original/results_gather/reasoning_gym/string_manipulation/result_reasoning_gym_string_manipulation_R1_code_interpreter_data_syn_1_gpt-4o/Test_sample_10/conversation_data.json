    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"acbaaaca\" in the specified order until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"acbaaaca\"\n\n2. **Rule Evaluation**:\n   - Rule 8: The string starts with 'ac', so we replace the first two characters with 'zz'.
