    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given transformation rules to the string \"caccabb\" in the specified order until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"caccabb\"\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Rule 1: The string does not start with 'bb'.\n   - Rule 2: The string does not start with 'ac'.\n   - Rule 3: The string length is not greater than 15.\n   - Rule 4: The string does not contain 'abc'.\n   - Rule 5: The string prefix is not 'aa'.\n   - Rule 6: The string suffix is 'bb', so we delete the last two characters. New string: \"cacca\".\n   - Rule 7: The string does not contain 'bca'.\n   - Rule 8: The string prefix is 'ca', so we replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end. New string: \"bbcc\".\n\n3. **Repeat the Process**:\n   - Rule 1: The string starts with 'bb', so we remove the second character.
