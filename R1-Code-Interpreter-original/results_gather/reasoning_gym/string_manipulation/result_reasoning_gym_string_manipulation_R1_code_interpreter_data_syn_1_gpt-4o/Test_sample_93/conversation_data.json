    "To solve this problem, we need to repeatedly apply the given transformation rules to the string until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Rule 1**: If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n2. **Rule 2**: If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n3. **Rule 3**: If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n\nWe will apply these rules in order and keep track of the states to detect any repetitions. If a state is repeated, we will terminate the process and consider the state before the repeated state as the final answer.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_string(s):\n    seen_states = set()\n    while s not in seen_states:\n        seen_states.add(s)\n        if s.startswith('bc'):\n            s = s[2:] + 'aa'\n        elif s.startswith('cb'):\n            s = 'aa' + s[2:-1]\n        elif s.endswith('aa'):\n            s = s[:-2] + 'cc'\n        else:\n            break\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"acbccabacbcc\"\nfinal_string = transform_string(initial_string)\nprint(final_string)\n```\n\nThis code will apply the transformation rules to the string and return the final transformed string. Let's execute it to find the result.",
