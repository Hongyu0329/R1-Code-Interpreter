    "\nassistant > To transform the string according to the given rules, we will apply each rule in order and repeat the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String:** `caabccbbabaaacbb`\n\nLet's apply the rules:\n\n- **Rule 1:** The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 2:** The string contains 'acb', so we replace the first occurrence with 'bca'. The string becomes `caabccbbababcaabb`.\n- **Rule 3:** The string does not start with 'bb', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 4:** The string does not end with 'aa', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n2. **New String:** `caabccbbababcaabb`\n\nLet's apply the rules again:\n\n- **Rule 1:** The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 2:** The string contains 'acb', so we replace the first occurrence with 'bca'. The string becomes `caabccbbababbcaab`.\n- **Rule 3:** The string does not start with 'bb', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 4:** The string does not end with 'aa', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **New String:** `caabccbbababbcaab`\n\nLet's apply the rules again:\n\n- **Rule 1:** The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 2:** The string contains 'acb', so we replace the first occurrence with 'bca'. The string becomes `caabccbbababbcab`.\n- **Rule 3:** The string does not start with 'bb', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 4:** The string does not end with 'aa', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n4. **New String:** `caabccbbababbcab`\n\nLet's apply the rules again:\n\n- **Rule 1:** The string does not end with 'ca', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 2:** The string does not contain 'acb', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 3:** The string does not start with 'bb', so this rule is not applicable.\n- **Rule 4:** The string does not end with 'aa', so this rule is not applicable.\n\nSince no rules are applicable, the transformation process stops here. The final transformed string is `caabccbbababbcab`.\n\nLet's enclose the final transformed string within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<caabccbbababbcab>>>"
