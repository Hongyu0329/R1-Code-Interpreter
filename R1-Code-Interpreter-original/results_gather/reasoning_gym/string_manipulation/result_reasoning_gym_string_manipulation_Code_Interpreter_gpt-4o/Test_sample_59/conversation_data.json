    "\nassistant > Let's apply the transformation rules to the string \"caccabb\" step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String:** `caccabb`\n\n2. **Rule 8:** If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - The string starts with 'ca', so we replace 'ca' with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - New String: `bbccabbc`\n\n3. **Rule 1:** If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - The string starts with 'bb', so we remove the second character.\n   - New String: `bccabbc`\n\n4. **Rule 4:** If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - The string contains 'cab', but not 'abc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **Rule 7:** If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - The string contains 'bca', so we delete it.\n   - New String: `cabbc`\n\n6. **Rule 8:** If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - The string starts with 'ca', so we replace 'ca' with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - New String: `bbbc`\n\n7. **Rule 1:** If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - The string starts with 'bb', so we remove the second character.\n   - New String: `bbc`\n\n8. **Rule 1:** If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - The string starts with 'bb', so we remove the second character.\n   - New String: `bc`\n\n9. **No further rules apply.**\n\nThe final transformed string is `bc`.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<bc>>>"
