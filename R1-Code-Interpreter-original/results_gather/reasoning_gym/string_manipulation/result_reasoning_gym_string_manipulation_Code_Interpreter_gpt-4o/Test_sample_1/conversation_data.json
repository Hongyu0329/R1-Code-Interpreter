  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.\n2. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n3. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n4. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n5. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n6. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.\n7. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\ncabbcccacc\n",

    "\nassistant > Let's apply the transformation rules to the string \"cabbcccacc\" step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: `cabbcccacc`\n\n2. **Rule 2**: The string contains 'ca' (not at the start), so we remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: `cabbccacc`\n\n3. **Rule 2**: The string still contains 'ca' (not at the start), so we remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n   - New String: `cabbcc`\n\n4. **No further rules apply**: The string does not end with 'ba', 'aa', or 'bca', does not start with 'bb' or 'ac', and its length is not greater than 15.\n\nSince no further transformations can be performed, the final transformed string is `cabbcc`.\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n<<<cabbcc>>>"
