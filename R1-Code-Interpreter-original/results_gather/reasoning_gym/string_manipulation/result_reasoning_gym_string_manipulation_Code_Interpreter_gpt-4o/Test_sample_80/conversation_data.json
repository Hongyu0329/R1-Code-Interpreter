If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n2. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n3. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n4. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n5.

    "\nassistant > To transform the string according to the given rules, we will apply each rule in order and repeat the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the transformation process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: `cccbcbbcabacbabcacbb`\n\nLet's apply the rules:\n\n- **Rule 1**: If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n  - Apply Rule 1: `cbcbbcabacbabcacbb`\n\n- **Rule 1**: If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n  - Not applicable.\n\n- **Rule 2**: If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n  - Not applicable.\n\n- **Rule 3**: If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n  - Not applicable.\n\n- **Rule 4**: If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n  - Not applicable.\n\n- **Rule 5**: If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n  - Not applicable.\n\nSince no rules are applicable, the transformation process is complete. The final transformed string is `cbcbbcabacbabcacbb`.\n\nLet's enclose the final transformed string within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<cbcbbcabacbabcacbb>>>"
