If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n2. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n3. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nbbacacaacbb\n",

    "\nassistant > To transform the string according to the given rules, we will apply the rules in the specified order and repeat the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the transformation process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String:** `bbacacaacbb`\n\n2. **Apply Rule 2:** The string starts with 'bb', so we remove the second character.\n   - Result: `bacacaacbb`\n\n3. **Apply Rule 1:** The string prefix is 'bc', so we delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - Result: `acacaacbbaa`\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3:** The string ends with 'aa', so we replace it with 'cc'.\n   - Result: `acacaacbbcc`\n\n5. **No Rule Applicable:** The string `acacaacbbcc` does not satisfy any of the rules.\n\nSince no further transformations can be performed, the final transformed string is `acacaacbbcc`.\n\nLet's enclose the final result within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<acacaacbbcc>>>"
