  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n2. If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n3. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n4. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nbbcaaaccb\n",

    "\nassistant > Let's apply the transformation rules to the string \"bbcaaaccb\" step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: `bbcaaaccb`\n\n2. **Rule 1**: The string does not start with 'bc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **Rule 2**: The string does not start with 'cc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n4. **Rule 3**: The string does not start with 'ab', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **Rule 4**: The string does not end with 'cc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\nSince none of the rules apply to the initial string, let's check the next possible transformation:\n\n1. **String**: `bbcaaaccb`\n\n2. **Rule 1**: The string starts with 'bc', so we delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - New String: `caaaccbaa`\n\n3. **Rule 2**: The string does not start with 'cc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n4. **Rule 3**: The string does not start with 'ab', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **Rule 4**: The string does not end with 'cc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\nLet's continue applying the rules to the new string:\n\n1. **String**: `caaaccbaa`\n\n2. **Rule 1**: The string does not start with 'bc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **Rule 2**: The string does not start with 'cc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n4. **Rule 3**: The string does not start with 'ab', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **Rule 4**: The string does not end with 'cc', so this rule is not applicable.\n\nSince no rules apply, the transformation process is complete. The final transformed string is `caaaccbaa`.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<caaaccbaa>>>"
