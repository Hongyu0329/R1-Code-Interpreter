    "\nassistant > To transform the string according to the given rules, we will apply the rules in order and repeat the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: `bbacbcbbc`\n\n2. **Rule 1**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (6 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n   - New String: `bbacbcbbcab`\n\n3. **Rule 2**: The string suffix is not 'bb', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n\n4. **Rule 3**: The string prefix is not 'bc', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\n5. **Rule 1**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (7 'b's), so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n\n6. **Rule 2**: The string suffix is not 'bb', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n\n7. **Rule 3**: The string prefix is not 'bc', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\nSince no rules are applicable, the transformation process stops here. The final transformed string is `bbacbcbbcab`.\n\nLet's enclose the final transformed string within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<bbacbcbbcab>>>"
