  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.\n2. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n3. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n4. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n5. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n6. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.\n7. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.\n8.
