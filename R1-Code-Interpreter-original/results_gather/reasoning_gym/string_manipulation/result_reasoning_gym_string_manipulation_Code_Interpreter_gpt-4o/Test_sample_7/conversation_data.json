    "\nassistant > Let's apply the transformation rules to the string \"bbaaabccacb\" step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: `bbaaabccacb`\n\n2. **Rule 4**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - New String: `bbaaaccb`\n\n3. **Rule 5**: The string prefix is 'bc', so we delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n   - New String: `aaaccbaa`\n\n4. **Rule 4**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - New String: `aaacc`\n\n5. **Rule 8**: The string suffix is 'ac', so we replace it with 'cb'.\n   - New String: `aacb`\n\n6. **Rule 3**: The string prefix is 'ab', so we replace it with 'ca'.\n   - New String: `cacb`\n\n7. **Rule 2**: The string prefix is 'ca', so we replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - New String: `bbc`\n\n8. **Rule 7**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (2 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n   - New String: `bbcab`\n\n9. **Rule 4**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - New String: `bb`\n\n10. **Rule 7**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (2 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n    - New String: `bbab`\n\n11. **Rule 3**: The string prefix is 'ab', so we replace it with 'ca'.\n    - New String: `bbca`\n\n12. **Rule 4**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence entirely.\n    - New String: `bb`\n\n13. **Rule 7**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (2 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n    - New String: `bbab`\n\n14. **Rule 3**: The string prefix is 'ab', so we replace it with 'ca'.\n    - New String: `bbca`\n\n15. **Rule 4**: The string contains 'bca', so we delete the first occurrence entirely.\n    - New String: `bb`\n\n16. **Rule 7**: The string contains an even number of 'b's (2 'b's), so we append 'ab' at the end.\n    - New String: `bbab`\n\nAt this point, we notice that the string `bbab` has appeared before, indicating a repeated state. Therefore, we terminate the process and consider the state before the repeated state as the final answer.\n\nThe final transformed string is `bb`. Therefore, the output is:\n\n```\n<<<bb>>>\n```"
