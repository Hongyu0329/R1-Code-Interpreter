  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.\n2. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n3. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n4. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.\n5. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n6. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\naccaaabbbbb\n",
