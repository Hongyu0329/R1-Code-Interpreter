    "\nassistant > To transform the string according to the given rules, we will repeatedly apply the rules in the specified order until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: `acbccabacbcc`\n\nLet's apply the rules:\n\n- The string does not start with 'bc', so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n- The string does not start with 'cb', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n- The string does not end with 'aa', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\nSince no rules are applicable, the transformation process stops here. The final transformed string is the same as the initial string.\n\nTherefore, the final transformed string is:\n\n<<<acbccabacbcc>>>"
