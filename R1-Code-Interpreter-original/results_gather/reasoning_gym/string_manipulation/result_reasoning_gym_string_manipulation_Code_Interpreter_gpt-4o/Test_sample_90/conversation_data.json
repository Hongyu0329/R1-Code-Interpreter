    "\nassistant > To transform the string according to the given rules, we will apply the rules in the specified order and repeat the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String:** `cbacbabccca`\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:** If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.\n   - The string contains 'bca' starting at index 2. Remove 'bca'.\n   - New String: `cbabccca`\n\n3. **Apply Rule 1 Again:** The string contains 'bca' starting at index 4. Remove 'bca'.\n   - New String: `cbacca`\n\n4. **Apply Rule 1 Again:** The string contains 'bca' starting at index 2. Remove 'bca'.\n   - New String: `cca`\n\n5. **Apply Rule 1 Again:** The string contains 'bca' starting at index 0. Remove 'bca'.\n   - New String: `ca`\n\n6. **Apply Rule 1 Again:** The string contains 'bca' starting at index 0. Remove 'bca'.\n   - New String: `a`\n\n7. **Apply Rule 3:** If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n   - The string does not start with 'aa', so no change.\n\n8. **Apply Rule 2:** If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.\n   - The string does not start with 'bb', so no change.\n\n9. **No further transformations can be applied.**\n\nThe final transformed string is `a`. Let's enclose it within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<a>>>"
