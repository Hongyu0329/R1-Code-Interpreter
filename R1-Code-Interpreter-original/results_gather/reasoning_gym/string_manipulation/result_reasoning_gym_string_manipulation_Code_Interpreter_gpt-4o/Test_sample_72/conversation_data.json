If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n2. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n3. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nacabb\n",

    "\nassistant > To transform the string \"acabb\" according to the given rules, we will apply the rules in order until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String:** \"acabb\"\n\n2. **Check Rules:**\n   - The string does not start with 'cb', so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'ab', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n   - The string starts with 'ca', so Rule 3 is applicable.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 3:**\n   - Replace 'ca' with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - New String: \"bbbcc\"\n\n4. **Check Rules:**\n   - The string does not start with 'cb', so Rule 1 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'ab', so Rule 2 is not applicable.\n   - The string does not start with 'ca', so Rule 3 is not applicable.\n\nSince no rules are applicable, the transformation process stops here. The final transformed string is \"bbbcc\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<bbbcc>>>"
