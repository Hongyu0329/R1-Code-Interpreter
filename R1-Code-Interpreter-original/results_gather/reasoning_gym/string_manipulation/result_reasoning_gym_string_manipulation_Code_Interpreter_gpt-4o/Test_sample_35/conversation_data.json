  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.\n2. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n3. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n4. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.\n5. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n6. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nabbbbcb\n",

    "\nassistant > To transform the string \"abbbbcb\" according to the given rules, we will apply the rules in order and repeat the process until no further transformations can be performed or a state is repeated. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"abbbbcb\"\n\n2. **Apply Rule 2**: The string contains 'abc', so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"cabbcb\"\n\n3. **Apply Rule 5**: The string prefix is 'ca', so replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - New String: \"bbbcbc\"\n\n4. **Apply Rule 2**: The string contains 'abc', so replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n   - New String: \"bbbcab\"\n\n5. **Apply Rule 5**: The string prefix is 'ca', so replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n   - New String: \"bbbbbc\"\n\n6. **No applicable rules**: The string \"bbbbbc\" does not match any of the rules.\n\nSince no further transformations can be performed, the final transformed string is \"bbbbbc\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<bbbbbc>>>"
