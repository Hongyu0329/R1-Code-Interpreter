  "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n2. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.\n3. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n4. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the final transformed string>>>.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\naccccbaabcaabb\n",

    "\nassistant > Let's apply the transformation rules to the string \"accccbaabcaabb\" step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"accccbaabcaabb\"\n\n2. **Rule 1**: The string does not end with 'aa', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **Rule 2**: The string length is 15, which is not greater than 15, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n4. **Rule 3**: The string does not start with 'ab', so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **Rule 4**: The string does not contain 'acb', so this rule is not applicable.\n\nSince no rules are applicable, the string remains unchanged. Therefore, the final transformed string is:\n\n<<<accccbaabcaabb>>>"
