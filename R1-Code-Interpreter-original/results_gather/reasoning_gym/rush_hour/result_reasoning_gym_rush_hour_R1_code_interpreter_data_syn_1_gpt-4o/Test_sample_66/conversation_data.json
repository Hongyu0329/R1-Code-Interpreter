    "To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each letter represents a car, and the red car is represented by 'AA'. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move horizontally to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\nx.GBBJ\nCCGHIJ\nFAAHIK\nFDD.IK\nEE.x..\n......\n```\n\n- The red car 'AA' is located in the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to move the cars blocking the path of 'AA' to clear the way.\n\nSteps to solve the puzzle:\n1. Move 'J' down to clear the path for 'G'.\n2. Move 'G' left to clear the path for 'AA'.\n3. Move 'AA' to the right to the exit.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial board state\nboard = [\n    ['x', '.', 'G', 'B', 'B', 'J'],\n    ['C', 'C', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J'],\n    ['F', 'A', 'A', 'H', 'I', 'K'],\n    ['F', 'D', 'D', '.', 'I', 'K'],\n    ['E', 'E', '.', 'x', '.', '.'],\n    ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']\n]\n\n# Define the moves to solve the puzzle\nmoves = []\n\n# Move J down\nmoves.append('J+1')\n\n# Move G left\nmoves.append('G-1')\n\n# Move AA to the right\nmoves.append('A+3')\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(' '.join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. The moves are as follows:\n\n- `J+1`: Move the car 'J' down by 1 space.\n- `G-1`: Move the car 'G' left by 1 space.\n- `A+3`: Move the red car 'AA' to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nThese moves will clear the path for the red car to exit the board.\n\n<<<J+1 G-1 A+3>>>"
