    "To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each car is represented by a letter, and the red car is represented by 'A'. The goal is to move the cars around to clear a path for the red car to exit the board.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\nGBBIJK\nG..IJK\nAAHI..\n..HCCC\n..xDD.\nEEEFF.\n```\n\n- The red car 'AA' is located on the third row and needs to move to the right to exit.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to move other cars out of the way to create a clear path for 'AA'.\n\n### Steps to solve:\n\n1. **Move 'H' down**: This will clear the path for 'A' to move right.\n2. **Move 'C' left**: This will further clear the path for 'A'.\n3. **Move 'A' right**: Move the red car to the exit.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial board state\nboard = [\n    \"GBBIJK\",\n    \"G..IJK\",\n    \"AAHI..\",\n    \"..HCCC\",\n    \"..xDD.\",\n    \"EEEFF.\"\n]\n\n# Define the moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Move 'H' down by 1\nmoves.append(\"H+1\")\n\n# Move 'C' left by 1\nmoves.append(\"C-1\")\n\n# Move 'A' right by 3 to exit\nmoves.append(\"A+3\")\n\n# Print the moves in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(moves) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. The moves are as follows:\n\n- Move 'H' down by 1 space.\n- Move 'C' left by 1 space.\n- Move 'A' right by 3 spaces to exit.\n\nThis sequence clears the path for the red car 'AA' to reach the exit on the right side of the board.\n\n<<<H+1 C-1 A+3>>>"
