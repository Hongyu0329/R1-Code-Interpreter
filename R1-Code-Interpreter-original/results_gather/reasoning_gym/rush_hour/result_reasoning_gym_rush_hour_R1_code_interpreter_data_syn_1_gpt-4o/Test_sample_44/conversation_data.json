    "To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each letter represents a car, and 'x' represents a wall. The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Our goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\nxBBHJK\nFCCHJK\nFAAI.L\nF..I.L\n..GDDL\nEEG...\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n- We need to move the cars blocking the path of the red car to clear the way.\n\nSteps to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the car 'I' down to clear the path for 'AA'.\n2. Move the car 'L' down to clear the path for 'AA'.\n3. Move the car 'AA' to the right to reach the exit.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    \"xBBHJK\",\n    \"FCCHJK\",\n    \"FAAI.L\",\n    \"F..I.L\",\n    \"..GDDL\",\n    \"EEG...\"\n]\n\n# Function to find the moves\ndef find_moves():\n    moves = []\n    # Move 'I' down by 1\n    moves.append('I+1')\n    # Move 'L' down by 1\n    moves.append('L+1')\n    # Move 'AA' to the right by 3\n    moves.append('A+3')\n    return moves\n\n# Get the moves\nmoves = find_moves()\n\n# Print the moves in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(moves)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. The moves are:\n\n- `I+1`: Move the car 'I' down by 1 space.\n- `L+1`: Move the car 'L' down by 1 space.\n- `A+3`: Move the red car 'AA' to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nThese moves will clear the path for the red car to exit the board.\n\n<<<I+1 L+1 A+3>>>"
