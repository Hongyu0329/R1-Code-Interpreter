    "To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each car is represented by a letter, and the red car is represented by 'A'. The goal is to move the cars around to clear a path for the red car to exit the board.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\nx.BBCC\nDDx.KL\nI.AAKL\nIEEFFL\nGGGJ..\nHHHJ..\n```\n\n- The red car 'AA' is located in the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to move the cars blocking the path of 'AA' to clear the way.\n\nSteps to solve the puzzle:\n1. Move 'K' down to free up space for 'A'.\n2. Move 'L' down to free up space for 'A'.\n3. Move 'A' to the right to exit.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate these moves and check if they lead to a solution.\n\n```python\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['x', '.', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['D', 'D', 'x', '.', 'K', 'L'],\n    ['I', '.', 'A', 'A', 'K', 'L'],\n    ['I', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'L'],\n    ['G', 'G', 'G', 'J', '.', '.'],\n    ['H', 'H', 'H', 'J', '.', '.']\n]\n\n# Function to print the board\ndef print_board(b):\n    for row in b:\n        print(''.join(row))\n    print()\n\n# Function to move a car\ndef move_car(b, car, direction, steps):\n    # Find the car's position\n    positions = [(r, c) for r in range(len(b)) for c in range(len(b[0])) if b[r][c] == car]\n    if not positions:\n        return False\n\n    # Determine if the car is horizontal or vertical\n    is_horizontal = positions[0][0] == positions[1][0]\n\n    # Move the car\n    if is_horizontal:\n        for r, c in positions:\n            b[r][c] = '.'\n        for r, c in positions:\n            if direction == 'right':\n                b[r][c + steps] = car\n            elif direction == 'left':\n                b[r][c - steps] = car\n    else:\n        for r, c in positions:\n            b[r][c] = '.'\n        for r, c in positions:\n            if direction == 'down':\n                b[r + steps][c] = car\n            elif direction == 'up':\n                b[r - steps][c] = car\n\n    return True\n\n# Simulate the moves\nprint(\"Initial Board:\")\nprint_board(board)\n\n# Move K down by 1\nmove_car(board, 'K', 'down', 1)\nprint(\"After moving K down by 1:\")\nprint_board(board)\n\n# Move L down by 1\nmove_car(board, 'L', 'down', 1)\nprint(\"After moving L down by 1:\")\nprint_board(board)\n\n# Move A right by 2\nmove_car(board, 'A', 'right', 2)\nprint(\"After moving A right by 2:\")\nprint_board(board)\n\n# Check if A is at the exit\na_at_exit = board[2][5] == 'A' and board[2][4] == 'A'\nprint(\"A at exit:\", a_at_exit)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the moves resulted in the red car 'AA' reaching the exit. The sequence of moves that led to this solution is as follows:\n\n1. Move 'K' down by 1 space.\n2. Move 'L' down by 1 space.\n3. Move 'A' right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nThe moves can be represented in the specified format as:\n\n<<<K+1 L+1 A+2>>>"
