    "To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each car is represented by a letter, and the red car is represented by 'A'. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\n...HI.\nBBBHI.\nAA.HJ.\nF.CCJ.\nF.GDD.\nEEG...\n```\n\n- The red car 'AA' is located in the third row and needs to move to the right.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to move other cars out of the way to clear a path for 'AA'.\n\nSteps to solve the puzzle:\n1. Move 'J' down to clear the path for 'A'.\n2. Move 'C' down to clear the path for 'A'.\n3. Move 'A' to the right to the exit.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    \"...HI.\",\n    \"BBBHI.\",\n    \"AA.HJ.\",\n    \"F.CCJ.\",\n    \"F.GDD.\",\n    \"EEG...\"\n]\n\n# Moves to solve the puzzle\nmoves = []\n\n# Step 1: Move 'J' down by 1\nmoves.append('J+1')\n\n# Step 2: Move 'C' down by 1\nmoves.append('C+1')\n\n# Step 3: Move 'A' to the right by 2 to reach the exit\nmoves.append('A+2')\n\n# Print the sequence of moves\nprint(' '.join(moves))\n```\n\nThe code will output the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. The moves are:\n\n- Move 'J' down by 1 space.\n- Move 'C' down by 1 space.\n- Move 'A' to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nThis sequence clears the path for the red car 'AA' to move to the exit on the right.\n\n<<<J+1 C+1 A+2>>>"
