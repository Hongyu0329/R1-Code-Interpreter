    "To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move horizontally to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\nxBBHJK\nx..HJK\nFAAI.L\nFCCI.L\n..GDDL\n..GEEE\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to move the cars blocking the path of the red car to clear the way.\n\n### Steps to solve:\n\n1. **Move the car 'I' down**: This will clear the path for the red car to move right.\n2. **Move the car 'L' down**: This will allow the car 'I' to move further down if needed.\n3. **Move the car 'C' up**: This will clear the path for the red car to move right.\n4. **Move the red car 'AA' to the right**: Move it to the exit.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code to ensure the moves are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    \"xBBHJK\",\n    \"x..HJK\",\n    \"FAAI.L\",\n    \"FCCI.L\",\n    \"..GDDL\",\n    \"..GEEE\"\n]\n\n# Moves to solve the puzzle\nmoves = []\n\n# Move I down by 1\nmoves.append(\"I+1\")\n\n# Move L down by 1\nmoves.append(\"L+1\")\n\n# Move C up by 1\nmoves.append(\"C-1\")\n\n# Move AA to the right by 3\nmoves.append(\"A+3\")\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\" \".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle. Let's interpret these moves:\n\n1. **I+1**: Move the car 'I' down by 1 space.\n2. **L+1**: Move the car 'L' down by 1 space.\n3. **C-1**: Move the car 'C' up by 1 space.\n4. **A+3**: Move the red car 'AA' to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nThese moves will clear the path for the red car to exit the board.\n\n<<<I+1 L+1 C-1 A+3>>>"
