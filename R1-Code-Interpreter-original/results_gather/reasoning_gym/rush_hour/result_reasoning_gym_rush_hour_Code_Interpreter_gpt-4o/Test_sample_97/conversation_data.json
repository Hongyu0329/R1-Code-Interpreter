    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle and move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right, we need to carefully plan the moves of the other vehicles to clear a path. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves:\n\n```\nInitial Board:\nBBBCCM\n..JDDM\nAAJK..\nIEEKFF\nIGGKLx\nHH..L.\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is currently blocked by the car (J) and the car (K). We need to move these cars out of the way to allow the red car to move to the exit. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move car (J) down by 1 space: `J+1`\n2. Move car (K) down by 1 space: `K+1`\n3. Move car (L) down by 1 space: `L+1`\n4.
