    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required:\n\n```\n..xBBx\n...E..\nAA.E..\n.CCC..\n..DD..\n......\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right.\n- The exit is located on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move car E down by 1 space to clear the path for car AA.\n2. Move car AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nLet's write the moves in the specified format: \n\n```\n<<<E+1 AA+2>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves should allow the red car to reach the exit."
