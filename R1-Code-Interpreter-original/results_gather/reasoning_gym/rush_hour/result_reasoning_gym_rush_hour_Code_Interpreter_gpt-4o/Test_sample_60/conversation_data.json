    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle and move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right, we need to carefully plan the moves of the other vehicles to clear a path. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves:\n\n```\nBBICCx\n..IJDD\nAAIJ.K\nHEEFFK\nH.GG..\n......\n```\n\n1. Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n2. Move car D left by 1 space: `D-1`\n3. Move car J down by 1 space: `J+1`\n4. Move car I down by 1 space: `I+1`\n5. Move car C right by 1 space: `C+1`\n6. Move car B down by 1 space: `B+1`\n7. Move car A right by 2 spaces to the exit: `A+2`\n\nLet's execute these moves: `K+1 D-1 J+1 I+1 C+1 B+1 A+2`."
