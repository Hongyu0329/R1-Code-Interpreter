    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required:\n\n```\nGBBIJK\nG..IJK\nAAHI..\n..HCCC\n..xDD.\nEEEFF.\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right. Let's identify the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move car H down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n2. Move car C left by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n3. Move car AA right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nLet's write these moves in the specified format:\n\n```\n<<<H+1 C-1 A+3>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves should allow the red car to reach the exit."
