    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle and move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right, we need to strategically move the other cars out of the way. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves:\n\nInitial Board:\n```\n..BBB.\n...FG.\nAA.FG.\nE..FH.\nECCCH.\nE.DD..\n```\n\n1. Move car B left by 3 spaces: `B-3`\n2. Move car A right by 2 spaces to the exit: `A+2`\n\nLet's execute these moves:\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1. Move car B left by 3 spaces: `B-3`\n2. Move car A right by 2 spaces to the exit: `A+2`\n\nThis will clear the path for the red car (AA) to exit the board."
