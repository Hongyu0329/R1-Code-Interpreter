    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle and move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right, we need to carefully plan the moves of the other vehicles to clear a path. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves:\n\n```\nGBBIJL\nG.HIJL\nAAH.KL\nCCDDK.\n..x...\n.EEFF.\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this:\n\n1. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n2. Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n3. Move car L down by 1 space: `L+1`\n4. Move car J right by 1 space: `J+1`\n5. Move car I right by 1 space: `I+1`\n6. Move car A right by 2 spaces to the exit: `A+2`\n\nLet's execute these moves:\nassistant > Here's the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. `H+1`: Move car H down by 1 space.\n2. `K+1`: Move car K down by 1 space.\n3. `L+1`: Move car L down by 1 space.\n4. `J+1`: Move car J right by 1 space.\n5. `I+1`: Move car I right by 1 space.\n6. `A+2`: Move car A right by 2 spaces to the exit.\n\nThe complete sequence is: `H+1 K+1 L+1 J+1 I+1 A+2`\n\nThis sequence should allow the red car (AA) to reach the exit on the right."
