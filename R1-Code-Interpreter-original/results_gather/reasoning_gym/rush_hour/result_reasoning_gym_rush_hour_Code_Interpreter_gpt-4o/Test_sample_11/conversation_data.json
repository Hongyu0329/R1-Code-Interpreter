    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required:\n\n```\nEBBCCC\nE....H\nF.xAAH\nF.G...\n..GDDD\n......\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right.\n- The exit is located on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car by moving other vehicles.\n\nLet's determine the sequence of moves to achieve this:\n\n1. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n2. Move car AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit: `A+2`\n\nLet's execute these moves.\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n`<<<H+1 A+2>>>`\n\nThis will move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
