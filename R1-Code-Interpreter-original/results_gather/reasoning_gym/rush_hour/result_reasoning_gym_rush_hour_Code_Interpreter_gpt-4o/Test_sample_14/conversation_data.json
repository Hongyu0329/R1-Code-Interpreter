    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle and move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right, we need to carefully plan the moves of the other vehicles to clear a path.

The exit is located on the right side of the third row. We need to clear the path by moving other vehicles out of the way.\n\nLet's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n2. Move car C left by 1 space: `C-1`\n3. Move car A right by 2 spaces to the exit: `A+2`\n\nLet's execute these moves.\nassistant > Here's the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n2.
