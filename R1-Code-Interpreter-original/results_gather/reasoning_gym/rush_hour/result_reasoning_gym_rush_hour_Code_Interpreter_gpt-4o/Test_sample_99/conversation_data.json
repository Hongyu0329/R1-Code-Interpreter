    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required:\n\n```\nBBCC.x\n...KDD\nxAAK.L\nEEJFFL\n..J.GG\n.HHHII\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is currently blocked by the car K. We need to move K out of the way to allow AA to move to the exit. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move K down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n2. Move AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nLet's execute these moves:\n\n```\nK+1 AA+2\n```\n\nThis should solve the puzzle by moving the red car to the exit."
