    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The red car is currently in the third row, and the exit is on the right side of the board. We need to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed:\n\n```\n.EBBB.\n.E..F.\nAA..F.\n..CCC.\n..DDD.\n......\n```\n\n1. Move car B to the left to clear the path for car E.\n2. Move car E down to clear the path for car A.\n3. Move car A to the right to the exit.\n\nLet's execute these moves:\n\n1. Move B left by 1: `B-1`\n2. Move E down by 1: `E+1`\n3. Move A right by 3: `A+3`\n\nThe sequence of moves is: `<<<B-1 E+1 A+3>>>`\n\nLet's verify this solution.\nassistant > Let's execute the moves step by step to ensure the solution is correct:\n\nInitial Board:\n```\n.EBBB.\n.E..F.\nAA..F.\n..CCC.\n..DDD.\n......\n```\n\n1. Move B left by 1: `B-1`\n   ```\n   .EBBB.\n   .E..F.\n   AA..F.\n   ..CCC.\n   ..DDD.\n   ......\n   ```\n\n2.
