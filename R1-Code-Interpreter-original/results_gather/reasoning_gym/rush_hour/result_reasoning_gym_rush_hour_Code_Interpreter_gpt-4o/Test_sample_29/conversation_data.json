    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\nInitial Board:\n```\nBBBCC.\n..JKDD\nAAJKLM\nI.EELM\nIFF..N\nGGHHHN\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right. Let's plan the moves:\n\n1. Move car M down by 1 to free space for car A.\n2. Move car A right by 2 to reach the exit.\n\nLet's execute these moves:\n\n- M+1\n- A+2\n\nFinal Board:\n```\nBBBCC.\n..JKDD\n..JKAA\nI.EELM\nIFF..N\nGGHHHN\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) has reached the exit. The moves are: <<<M+1 A+2>>>"
