    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle and move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right, we need to strategically move the other cars to clear a path. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves:\n\n```\n.BBICC\nxDDI.J\nx.HAAJ\nG.H..K\nGEE..K\n...FFF\n```\n\n1. Move car J down by 1 space: `J+1`\n2. Move car AA right by 1 space: `A+1`\n3. Move car I up by 1 space: `I-1`\n4. Move car C left by 1 space: `C-1`\n5. Move car B left by 1 space: `B-1`\n6. Move car D up by 1 space: `D-1`\n7. Move car H left by 1 space: `H-1`\n8. Move car G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n9. Move car E right by 1 space: `E+1`\n10. Move car F up by 1 space: `F-1`\n11. Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n12.
