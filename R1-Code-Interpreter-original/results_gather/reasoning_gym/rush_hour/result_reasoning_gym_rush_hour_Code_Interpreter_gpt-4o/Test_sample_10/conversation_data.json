    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\nInitial Board:\n```\n.xBBCC\n..x.K.\nG.AAK.\nG.IJDD\nH.IJ..\nHEEFFF\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is currently blocked by the car (K) and the wall (x).

The sequence of moves is:\n\n- Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n- Move car AA right by 2 spaces: `A+2`\n\nThus, the complete move sequence is: `<<<K+1 A+2>>>`."
