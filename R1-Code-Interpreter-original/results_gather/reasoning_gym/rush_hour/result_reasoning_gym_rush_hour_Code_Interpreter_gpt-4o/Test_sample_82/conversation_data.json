    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required:\n\n```\nF..HBB\nFCCH.I\nAAG..I\n..GDDI\n..xx..\n...EEE\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right.\n- The exit is located on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car by moving other vehicles out of the way.\n\nLet's determine the sequence of moves to achieve this: \n\n1. Move car 'I' down by 1 space.\n2. Move car 'G' up by 1 space.\n3. Move car 'C' left by 2 spaces.\n4. Move car 'H' left by 1 space.\n5. Move car 'B' left by 1 space.\n6.
