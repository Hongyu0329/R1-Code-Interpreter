    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\nInitial Board:\n```\n...G..\n...GBB\n..AAHI\nx...HI\nFCCDDI\nF..EEE\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right. Let's identify the sequence of moves to clear a path for the red car to reach the exit.\n\n1. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n2. Move car I down by 1 space: `I+1`\n3. Move car B left by 2 spaces: `B-2`\n4. Move car G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n5. Move car A right by 3 spaces to the exit: `A+3`\n\nLet's execute these moves.\nassistant > Here's the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n2.

Move car A right by 3 spaces to the exit: `A+3`\n\nThe complete move sequence is: `H+1 I+1 B-2 G+1 A+3`\n\nThis sequence will allow the red car (AA) to reach the exit on the right."
