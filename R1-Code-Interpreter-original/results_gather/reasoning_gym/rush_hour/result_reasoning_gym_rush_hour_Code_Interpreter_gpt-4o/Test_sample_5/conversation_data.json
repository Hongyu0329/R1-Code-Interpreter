    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle and move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right, we need to strategically move the other cars to clear a path. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves:\n\n```\n..FGBB\n..FGCC\nAAFGHI\n....HI\n.....x\n.DDEE.\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right.\n- The exit is located on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to move the cars blocking the path of the red car.\n\nLet's determine the sequence of moves to achieve this:\n\n1. Move car F down by 1 space: `F+1`\n2. Move car G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n3. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n4. Move car I down by 1 space: `I+1`\n5. Move car A to the right by 2 spaces: `A+2`\n\nNow, let's execute these moves:\nassistant > Let's execute the moves step by step:\n\n1. Move car F down by 1 space: `F+1`\n   ```\n   ..G.BB\n   ..G.CC\n   AAFGHI\n   ..FGHI\n   .....x\n   .DDEE.\n   ```\n\n2.
