    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\nInitial Board:\n```\nx.BBCC\nDDx.KL\nI.AAKL\nIEEFFL\nGGGJ..\nHHHJ..\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is currently blocked by the car (KL) and the car (BB). We need to move these cars out of the way to create a path for the red car to exit.\n\nLet's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move car (KL) down by 1 space: `K+1 L+1`\n2. Move car (BB) left by 2 spaces: `B-2`\n3. Move car (AA) right by 2 spaces to the exit: `A+2`\n\nLet's execute these moves and verify the solution.\nassistant > Here's the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.
