    "\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\nInitial Board:\n```\n..BBBI\nx.CCCI\nAA.GHI\n...GH.\n..DDx.\n..EEFF\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right. We need to clear the path for it by moving other cars out of the way. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move car I down by 1 space: `I+1`\n2. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n3. Move car G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n4. Move car C left by 1 space: `C-1`\n5. Move car B left by 1 space: `B-1`\n6. Move car A right by 4 spaces to the exit: `A+4`\n\nLet's execute these moves.\nassistant > Here's the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move car I down by 1 space: `I+1`\n2. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n3. Move car G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n4. Move car C left by 1 space: `C-1`\n5. Move car B left by 1 space: `B-1`\n6. Move car A right by 4 spaces to the exit: `A+4`\n\nLet's apply these moves to the board:\n\n1. Move I down by 1:\n   ```\n   ..BBBI\n   x.CCC.\n   AA.GHI\n   ...GH.\n   ..DDxI\n   ..EEFF\n   ```\n\n2. Move H down by 1:\n   ```\n   ..BBBI\n   x.CCC.\n   AA.G.I\n   ...G.H\n   ..DDxH\n   ..EEFF\n   ```\n\n3. Move G down by 1:\n   ```\n   ..BBBI\n   x.CCC.\n   AA...I\n   ...G.H\n   ..DDxH\n   ..EEFF\n   ```\n\n4. Move C left by 1:\n   ```\n   ..BBBI\n   xCCC..\n   AA...I\n   ...G.H\n   ..DDxH\n   ..EEFF\n   ```\n\n5. Move B left by 1:\n   ```\n   .BBB.I\n   xCCC..\n   AA...I\n   ...G.H\n   ..DDxH\n   ..EEFF\n   ```\n\n6. Move A right by 4 to the exit:\n   ```\n   .BBB.I\n   xCCC..\n   ....AI\n   ...G.H\n   ..DDxH\n   ..EEFF\n   ```\n\nThe red car (AA) has successfully moved to the exit. The sequence of moves is: `I+1 H+1 G+1 C-1 B-1 A+4`."
