    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\nInitial Board:\n```\nEBB.CC\nE.F..H\nAAF.GH\n....GI\n.xDDGI\n.....I\n```\n\nThe red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to be moved to the right. Let's identify the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move car F down by 1 space to free up space for car A.\n2. Move car A right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nLet's execute these moves:\n\n- F+1\n- A+2\n\nFinal sequence of moves: `<<<F+1 A+2>>>`"
