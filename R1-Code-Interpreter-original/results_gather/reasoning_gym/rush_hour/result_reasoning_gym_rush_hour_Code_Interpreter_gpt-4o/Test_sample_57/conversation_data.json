    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\nInitial Board:\n```\n.xEBBB\n..EFG.\nAA.FGH\nD.CC.H\nD....x\nD.....\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right.\n- The exit is located on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car by moving other vehicles.\n\nLet's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move car F down by 1 space: `F+1`\n2. Move car G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n3. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n4. Move car C up by 1 space: `C-1`\n5. Move car E right by 1 space: `E+1`\n6. Move car B right by 1 space: `B+1`\n7. Move car A right by 2 spaces to the exit: `A+2`\n\nLet's execute these moves.\nassistant > Here is the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move car F down by 1 space: `F+1`\n2. Move car G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n3. Move car H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n4. Move car C up by 1 space: `C-1`\n5. Move car E right by 1 space: `E+1`\n6. Move car B right by 1 space: `B+1`\n7. Move car A right by 2 spaces to the exit: `A+2`\n\nThe complete move sequence is: `<<<F+1 G+1 H+1 C-1 E+1 B+1 A+2>>>`\n\nThis sequence will allow the red car (AA) to reach the exit on the right."
