    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n..xBBK\nGCCJ.K\nGAAJ..\nDDIJ..\n.HIEE.\n.HFFx.\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located in the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit Path:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The car J is blocking the path of the red car (AA) in the third row.\n   - The car K is blocking the path of the car J in the second row.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car K to the right to clear the path for car J.\n   - Move car J to the right to clear the path for car AA.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move K:**\n   - Move K to the right by 1 space to clear the path for J.\n   - Move: `K+1`\n\n2. **Move J:**\n   - Move J to the right by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n   - Move: `J+1`\n\n3. **Move AA:**\n   - Move AA to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine the moves in the specified format: `K+1 J+1 A+2`\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is: `<<<K+1 J+1 A+2>>>`"
