    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n.xEBBB\n..EFG.\nAA.FGH\nD.CC.H\nD....x\nD.....\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, starting from the first column.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car F in the third row.\n   - The car F is blocked by the car G in the third row.\n   - The car G is blocked by the car H in the third row.\n\n4. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - We need to move cars F, G, and H to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Move car H down by 2 spaces to clear the path for G.\n   - Move car G right by 1 space to clear the path for F.\n   - Move car F right by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n- **H+2:** Move car H down by 2 spaces.\n- **G+1:** Move car G right by 1 space.\n- **F+1:** Move car F right by 1 space.\n- **A+3:** Move the red car (AA) right by 3 spaces to the exit.\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n```\n<<<H+2 G+1 F+1 A+3>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
