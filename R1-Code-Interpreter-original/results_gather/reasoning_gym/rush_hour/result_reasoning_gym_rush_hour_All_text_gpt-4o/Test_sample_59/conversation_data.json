    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBB...J\n.G..IJ\n.GAAIJ\n...HCC\nDD.H..\nEEFFx.\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n   - The exit is to the right of the red car, in column 6.\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car (IJ) in the third row, columns 5 and 6.\n   - The car (IJ) is part of a vertical car (J) that also occupies the second row, column 6.\n\n3. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - To move the red car to the exit, we need to move the car (IJ) out of the way.\n   - The car (IJ) can only move vertically, so we need to move it down.\n\n4. **Move Sequence:**\n   - **Move 1:** Move car (J) down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n     - This will move (IJ) from the third row to the fourth row.\n   - **Move 2:** Move the red car (AA) to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move J down by 1: `J+1`\n   - Move AA right by 2: `A+2`\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n```\n<<<J+1 A+2>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
