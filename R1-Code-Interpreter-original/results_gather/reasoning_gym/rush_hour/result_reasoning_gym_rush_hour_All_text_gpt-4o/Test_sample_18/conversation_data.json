    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBHICC\n.GHIJ.\n.GAAJK\nDD..xK\nEE...K\n..xFF.\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the position of the red car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify the exit path:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify obstacles blocking the red car:**\n   - The red car is blocked by car J in column 4 and car K in column 5.\n\n4. **Plan to clear the path:**\n   - Move car J down to free column 4.\n   - Move car K down to free column 5.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move car J down:**\n   - Car J is vertical and located in columns 4 and 5, rows 2 and 3.\n   - Move J down by 1 space to rows 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Move car K down:**\n   - Car K is vertical and located in column 5, rows 3, 4, and 5.\n   - Move K down by 1 space to rows 4, 5, and 6.\n\n3. **Move the red car (AA) to the exit:**\n   - Now that columns 4 and 5 are clear, move the red car (AA) right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Final Moves:\n- J+1 (Move car J down by 1 space)\n- K+1 (Move car K down by 1 space)\n- A+3 (Move the red car AA right by 3 spaces to the exit)\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<J+1 K+1 A+3>>>"
