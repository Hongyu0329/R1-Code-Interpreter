    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\n.EBBH.\n.E.GH.\n.AAG..\n..FCCC\n..F...\n.DDD.x\n```\n\n- **AA** is the red car that needs to be moved to the exit on the right.\n- **E, B, H, G, F, C, D** are other vehicles that need to be moved to clear the path for AA.\n- The exit is located on the right side of the third row.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the path for AA:**\n   - **AA** is blocked by **G**. We need to move **G** down to free the path for **AA**.\n   - **G** is currently in the second row, third column. It can be moved down by 1 space.\n\n2. **Move G:**\n   - Move **G** down by 1 space: `G+1`\n   - New position of **G**: third row, third column.\n\n3. **Move AA:**\n   - Now that **G** is out of the way, move **AA** to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move **AA** right by 2 spaces: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- **G+1**: Move **G** down by 1 space.\n- **A+2**: Move **AA** right by 2 spaces to the exit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is:\n\n**<<<G+1 A+2>>>**"
