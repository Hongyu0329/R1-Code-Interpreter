    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nx.BBJ.\n..H.JK\nG.HAAK\nGCCI.K\nGDDIEE\nx.FF..\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 4 and 5.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically at the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car needs to move to the right, but it is blocked by the car K.\n\n4. **Plan to Move Car K:**\n   - Car K is vertically oriented and can be moved down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Move car K down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 1 space to reach the exit.\n\n### Detailed Move Sequence:\n\n- **Move K down by 1 space:**\n  - This will change the position of K from rows 2-4 to rows 3-5.\n\n- **Move AA to the right by 1 space:**\n  - This will move the red car to the exit.\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n```\n<<<K+1 AA+1>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
