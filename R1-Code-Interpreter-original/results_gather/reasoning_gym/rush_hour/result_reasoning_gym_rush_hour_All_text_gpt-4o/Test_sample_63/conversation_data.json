    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the possible moves step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   .BBBKM\n   CC.IKM\n   AA.ILM\n   GDDJL.\n   G.HJEE\n   FFH...\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit Path:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n4. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The red car needs to move right, but it is blocked by the car 'I' in column 3.\n\n5. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - We need to move the car 'I' out of the way to allow the red car to move right.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move 'I' down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move 'AA' right by 1 space to reach the exit.\n\n7. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move 'I' down: `I+1`\n   - Move 'AA' right: `A+1`\n\n8. **Final Board Configuration:**\n   - After moving 'I' down and 'AA' right, the red car reaches the exit.\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: `<<<I+1 A+1>>>`"
