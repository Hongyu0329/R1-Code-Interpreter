    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Board Layout:**\n   ```\n   ..xBBL\n   ..ICCL\n   AAIJ..\n   HDDJEE\n   HFFJKx\n   GG..K.\n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and can only move left or right.\n   - Other cars and walls block the path, so they need to be moved to clear the way.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Move car L down to clear the path for car C.\n     - Move L down by 1: `L+1`\n     - New board:\n       ```\n       ..xBB.\n       ..ICC.\n       AAIJ.L\n       HDDJEE\n       HFFJKx\n       GG..K.\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 2:** Move car C to the right to clear the path for car A.\n     - Move C right by 1: `C+1`\n     - New board:\n       ```\n       ..xBB.\n       ..I.CC\n       AAIJ.L\n       HDDJEE\n       HFFJKx\n       GG..K.\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 3:** Move car J down to clear the path for car A.\n     - Move J down by 1: `J+1`\n     - New board:\n       ```\n       ..xBB.\n       ..I.CC\n       AAI..L\n       HDDJEE\n       HFFJKJ\n       GG..K.\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 4:** Move car A to the right to the exit.\n     - Move A right by 3: `A+3`\n     - New board:\n       ```\n       ..xBB.\n       ..I.CC\n       ..IJAA\n       HDDJEE\n       HFFJKJ\n       GG..K.\n       ```\n\n5. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - `L+1 C+1 J+1 A+3`\n\nThe red car (AA) has successfully moved to the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer:** <<<L+1 C+1 J+1 A+3>>>"
