    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. We need to clear a path for it to reach the exit. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 4 and 5.\n- The exit is to the right of the red car, at the end of the third row.\n- The red car is blocked by the car (I) in the third row, column 6.\n- The car (I) is vertically oriented, so it can only move up or down.\n- To move (I) down, we need to clear space in the fourth row.\n- The car (G) in the fourth row, column 4, is blocking (I) from moving down.\n- The car (G) is vertically oriented, so it can only move up or down.\n- To move (G) down, we need to clear space in the fifth row.\n- The car (D) in the fifth row, columns 5 and 6, is blocking (G) from moving down.\n- The car (D) is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right.\n- To move (D) left, we need to clear space in the fifth row, columns 3 and 4.\n- The car (C) in the fourth row, columns 1 and 2, is blocking (D) from moving left.\n- The car (C) is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move C left by 1 space**: This clears space for D to move left.\n   - Move: `C-1`\n   - New position of C: (4, 1) and (4, 2) -> (4, 0) and (4, 1)\n\n2. **Move D left by 2 spaces**: This clears space for G to move down.\n   - Move: `D-2`\n   - New position of D: (5, 5) and (5, 6) -> (5, 3) and (5, 4)\n\n3. **Move G down by 1 space**: This clears space for I to move down.\n   - Move: `G+1`\n   - New position of G: (4, 4) -> (5, 4)\n\n4. **Move I down by 1 space**: This clears the path for the red car (AA).\n   - Move: `I+1`\n   - New position of I: (3, 6) -> (4, 6)\n\n5. **Move AA right by 2 spaces**: This moves the red car to the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n   - New position of AA: (3, 4) and (3, 5) -> (3, 6) and (3, 7) (exit)\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<C-1 D-2 G+1 I+1 A+2>>>`"
