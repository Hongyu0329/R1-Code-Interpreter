    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBBCC.\n..JKDD\nAAJKLM\nI.EELM\nIFF..N\nGGHHHN\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car J (vertically oriented) and car K (horizontally oriented) on its right.\n   - Car J is blocked by car D above it.\n   - Car K is blocked by car D above it and car L to its right.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - We need to clear the path for the red car by moving the blocking cars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move Car D:**\n   - Move car D up by 1 space to clear the path for car J.\n   - `D-1`\n\n2. **Move Car J:**\n   - Move car J up by 1 space to clear the path for car K.\n   - `J-1`\n\n3. **Move Car K:**\n   - Move car K left by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - `K-1`\n\n4. **Move Car L:**\n   - Move car L left by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - `L-1`\n\n5. **Move Red Car (AA):**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine all the moves in the specified format.\n\n**Answer:**\n`<<<D-1 J-1 K-1 L-1 A+4>>>`"
