    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBGI.K\nEFGIxK\nEFAAJL\nCCH.JL\n..HDD.\n......\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The car (K) is blocking the exit path of the red car (AA).\n   - The car (J) is also in the path of the red car (AA).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - We need to clear the path for the red car (AA) to move to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move K Down:**\n   - Move K down by 1 space to clear the path for J.\n   - Move: `K+1`\n\n2. **Move J Right:**\n   - Move J right by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n   - Move: `J+1`\n\n3. **Move AA Right:**\n   - Move AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine the moves in the specified format: `K+1 J+1 A+2`\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is: `<<<K+1 J+1 A+2>>>`"
