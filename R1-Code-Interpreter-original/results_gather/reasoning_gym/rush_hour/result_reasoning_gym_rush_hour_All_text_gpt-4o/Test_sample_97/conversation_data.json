    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to reach the exit.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\nBBBCCM\n..JDDM\nAAJK..\nIEEKFF\nIGGKLx\nHH..L.\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row, starting from column 1 to column 2.\n- The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n- The red car needs to move 4 spaces to the right to reach the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the Path for AA:**\n   - The red car (AA) is blocked by the car J and the car K.\n   - Car J is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - Car K is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n\n2. **Move Car J:**\n   - Car J is currently at positions (2,3) and (3,3).\n   - Move car J down by 1 space to positions (3,3) and (4,3).\n\n3. **Move Car K:**\n   - Car K is currently at positions (2,4), (3,4), and (4,4).\n   - Move car K down by 1 space to positions (3,4), (4,4), and (5,4).\n\n4. **Move Car L:**\n   - Car L is currently at positions (2,5), (4,5), and (5,5).\n   - Move car L down by 1 space to positions (3,5), (5,5), and (6,5).\n\n5. **Move Car M:**\n   - Car M is horizontally oriented and is currently at positions (1,5) and (1,6).\n   - Move car M to the left by 1 space to positions (1,4) and (1,5).\n\n6. **Move Car F:**\n   - Car F is horizontally oriented and is currently at positions (4,5) and (4,6).\n   - Move car F to the left by 1 space to positions (4,4) and (4,5).\n\n7. **Move Car E:**\n   - Car E is horizontally oriented and is currently at positions (4,2) and (4,3).\n   - Move car E to the left by 1 space to positions (4,1) and (4,2).\n\n8. **Move Car I:**\n   - Car I is vertically oriented and is currently at positions (4,1) and (5,1).\n   - Move car I up by 1 space to positions (3,1) and (4,1).\n\n9. **Move Car G:**\n   - Car G is horizontally oriented and is currently at positions (5,2) and (5,3).\n   - Move car G to the left by 1 space to positions (5,1) and (5,2).\n\n10. **Move Car H:**\n    - Car H is horizontally oriented and is currently at positions (6,1) and (6,2).\n    - Move car H to the right by 1 space to positions (6,2) and (6,3).\n\n11. **Move Red Car AA:**\n    - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) 4 spaces to the right to reach the exit.\n\n### Final Moves:\n```\n<<<J+1 K+1 L+1 M-1 F-1 E-1 I-1 G-1 H+1 AA+4>>>\n```\n\nAnswer: <<<J+1 K+1 L+1 M-1 F-1 E-1 I-1 G-1 H+1 AA+4>>>"
