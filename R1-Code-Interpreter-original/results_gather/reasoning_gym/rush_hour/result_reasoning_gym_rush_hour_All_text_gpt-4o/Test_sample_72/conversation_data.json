    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n..xBBx\n...E..\nAA.E..\n.CCC..\n..DD..\n......\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is horizontally oriented and located in the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is located on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The car E is blocking the path of the red car (AA) to the exit.\n   - Car E is vertically oriented and located in the third and fourth rows, column 4.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car E down to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n\n5. **Other Cars:**\n   - Cars B, C, and D are not directly blocking the path of the red car (AA) to the exit, so they do not need to be moved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move Car E Down:**\n   - Move car E down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n   - Move: `E+1`\n\n2. **Move Red Car (AA) to the Exit:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine the moves into the specified format: `<<<E+1 A+2>>>`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<E+1 A+2>>>`"
