    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n1. BBBKCC\n2. DDJK.L\n3. I.JAAL\n4. IEE.xM\n5. FF...M\n6. GGHH.x\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis and Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the position of the red car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on row 3, columns 4 and 5.\n\n2. **Identify the exit:**\n   - The exit is on row 3, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify obstacles blocking the red car:**\n   - The car L is blocking the red car from reaching the exit. It is located on row 2, column 5 and row 3, column 5.\n\n4. **Plan to move car L:**\n   - Car L is vertically oriented, so it can move up or down.\n   - To clear the path for the red car, move car L down by 1 space.\n\n5. **Execute the move for car L:**\n   - Move L down by 1 space: `L+1`\n\n6. **Move the red car (AA) to the exit:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) right by 1 space to reach the exit.\n\n7. **Execute the move for the red car (AA):**\n   - Move AA right by 1 space: `A+1`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Move L down by 1 space: `L+1`\n- Move AA right by 1 space: `A+1`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<L+1 A+1>>>`"
