    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBB.xK\nCCDDDK\nHAAJ..\nH..JEE\n..IFFx\nGGI...\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the position and orientation of each car:**\n   - **B**: Horizontal, top row.\n   - **C**: Vertical, second column.\n   - **D**: Horizontal, second row.\n   - **K**: Vertical, rightmost column.\n   - **H**: Vertical, leftmost column.\n   - **J**: Vertical, fourth column.\n   - **E**: Horizontal, fourth row.\n   - **F**: Horizontal, fifth row.\n   - **G**: Vertical, leftmost column.\n   - **I**: Vertical, third column.\n   - **A**: Horizontal, third row.\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - **Step 1**: Move car **J** down to clear the path for **A**.\n     - Move **J** down by 1 space: `J+1`\n   - **Step 2**: Move car **A** to the right.\n     - Move **A** right by 2 spaces to reach the exit: `A+2`\n\n### Execution of Moves:\n- **Move 1**: `J+1` (Move car **J** down by 1 space)\n- **Move 2**: `A+2` (Move car **A** right by 2 spaces to the exit)\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<J+1 A+2>>>`"
