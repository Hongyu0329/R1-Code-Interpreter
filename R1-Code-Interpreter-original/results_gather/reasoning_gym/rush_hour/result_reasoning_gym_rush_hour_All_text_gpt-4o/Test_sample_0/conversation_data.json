    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n...G..\n...GBB\n..AAHI\nx...HI\nFCCDDI\nF..EEE\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n   - The goal is to move it to the right until it exits the board.\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car (H) on its right.\n   - Car (H) is vertically oriented and can be moved down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n3. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car (H) down by 2 spaces to clear the path for the red car.\n   - This will require moving car (I) down as well, since it is directly below car (H).\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move car (I) down by 1 space to make room for car (H).\n   - Move car (H) down by 2 spaces.\n\n5. **Move the Red Car (AA):**\n   - With car (H) moved down, the red car (AA) can now move to the right.\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n- Move I down by 1: `I+1`\n- Move H down by 2: `H+2`\n- Move AA to the right by 2: `A+2`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<I+1 H+2 A+2>>>`"
