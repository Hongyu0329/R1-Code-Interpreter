    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBCCC.\n...GH.\nAA.GH.\n..DDH.\n.EEE..\n..FFF.\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the G car in column 3 and the H car in column 4.\n\n4. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - We need to move the G and H cars to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Move Sequence:**\n   - **Move G Down:** Move the G car down by 1 space to free up the third row.\n   - **Move H Down:** Move the H car down by 1 space to free up the third row.\n   - **Move AA Right:** Move the red car (AA) right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n\n- **Move G Down by 1:** This will move the G car from row 2 to row 3.\n- **Move H Down by 1:** This will move the H car from row 2 to row 3.\n- **Move AA Right by 4:** This will move the red car to the exit.\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n```\n<<<G+1 H+1 A+4>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car to the exit on the right."
