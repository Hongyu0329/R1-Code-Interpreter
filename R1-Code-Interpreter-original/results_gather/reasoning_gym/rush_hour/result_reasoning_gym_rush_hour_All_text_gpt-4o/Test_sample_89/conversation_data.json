    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nIBBCC.\nIDDEEL\nIAA.KL\nFFF.K.\n.JGGHH\n.J....\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, starting from column 2 to column 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row, at column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car needs to move to the right, but it is blocked by car K in column 5.\n\n4. **Plan to Move Car K:**\n   - Car K is vertically oriented and can move up or down. It is currently in columns 5 and 6, rows 3 and 4.\n\n5. **Clear Path for Car K:**\n   - Car F is blocking car K from moving down. Car F is horizontally oriented and occupies row 4, columns 1 to 3.\n   - Move car F to the left to clear the path for car K.\n\n6. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move car F left by 1 space: `F-1`\n     - New position of F: row 4, columns 0 to 2.\n   - Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n     - New position of K: columns 5 and 6, rows 4 and 5.\n\n7. **Move the Red Car (AA) to the Exit:**\n   - Now that car K is out of the way, move the red car (AA) right by 3 spaces: `A+3`\n     - New position of AA: row 3, columns 5 and 6.\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `F-1 K+1 A+3`\n\n**Answer: `<<<F-1 K+1 A+3>>>`**"
