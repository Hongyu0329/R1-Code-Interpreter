    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nG..x..\nGBBJ.L\nAAIJ.L\nCCIDDL\n.HEEK.\n.HFFK.\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The goal is to move it to the right until it exits the board.\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car (IJ) on its right.\n   - The car (IJ) is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n\n3. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move the car (IJ) down to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n   - The car (IJ) is currently on rows 2 and 3, columns 3 and 4.\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move car (I) down by 1 space: `I+1`\n   - Move car (J) down by 1 space: `J+1`\n   - This will move the car (IJ) to rows 3 and 4, columns 3 and 4.\n\n5. **Move the Red Car (AA):**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) to the right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move car (A) right by 4 spaces: `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `I+1 J+1 A+4`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<I+1 J+1 A+4>>>`"
