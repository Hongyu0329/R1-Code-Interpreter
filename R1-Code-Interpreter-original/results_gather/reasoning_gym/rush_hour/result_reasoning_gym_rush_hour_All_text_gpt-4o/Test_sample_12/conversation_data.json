    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   GBBIJK\n   G..IJK\n   AAHI..\n   ..HCCC\n   ..xDD.\n   EEEFF.\n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and can only move left or right.\n   - Other cars and walls block the path, so they need to be moved to clear the way.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Move car H down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n     - Move: `H+1`\n     - Board:\n       ```\n       GBBIJK\n       G..IJK\n       AA.I..\n       ..HCCC\n       ..xDD.\n       EEEFF.\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 2:** Move car C to the right by 1 space to further clear the path for AA.\n     - Move: `C+1`\n     - Board:\n       ```\n       GBBIJK\n       G..IJK\n       AA.I..\n       ...HCC\n       ..xDD.\n       EEEFF.\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 3:** Move car I up by 1 space to make room for AA.\n     - Move: `I-1`\n     - Board:\n       ```\n       GBBIJK\n       G..IJK\n       AA..I.\n       ...HCC\n       ..xDD.\n       EEEFF.\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 4:** Move car A (red car) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n     - Move: `A+3`\n     - Board:\n       ```\n       GBBIJK\n       G..IJK\n       ....AA\n       ...HCC\n       ..xDD.\n       EEEFF.\n       ```\n\n5. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - Combine all the moves: `H+1 C+1 I-1 A+3`\n\n**Answer: `<<<H+1 C+1 I-1 A+3>>>`**"
