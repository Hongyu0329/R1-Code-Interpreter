    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJ.L.\nHIAAL.\nHIEELx\nH..KFF\nGG.K..\n```\n\n- **AA** is the red car, located in row 3, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is at row 3, column 6.\n- **BB** is a horizontal car in row 1, columns 1 and 2.\n- **CC** is a horizontal car in row 1, columns 4 and 5.\n- **DD** is a vertical car in columns 1, rows 2 and 3.\n- **J** is a vertical car in column 3, rows 1 and 2.\n- **L** is a vertical car in column 5, rows 2 and 3.\n- **H** is a vertical car in column 1, rows 3 to 5.\n- **I** is a horizontal car in row 3, columns 1 and 2.\n- **EE** is a horizontal car in row 4, columns 3 and 4.\n- **K** is a vertical car in column 4, rows 5 and 6.\n- **FF** is a horizontal car in row 5, columns 5 and 6.\n- **GG** is a horizontal car in row 6, columns 1 and 2.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Move I left by 1 space**: This will clear the path for AA to move.\n   - Move: `I-1`\n   - New position of I: row 3, columns 0 and 1.\n\n2. **Move AA right by 2 spaces**: This will move the red car closer to the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n   - New position of AA: row 3, columns 4 and 5.\n\n3. **Move L down by 1 space**: This will clear the path for AA to move to the exit.\n   - Move: `L+1`\n   - New position of L: column 5, rows 3 and 4.\n\n4. **Move AA right by 1 space**: This will move the red car to the exit.\n   - Move: `A+1`\n   - New position of AA: row 3, columns 5 and 6 (exit).\n\n### Final Moves:\nCombining all the moves, we get the sequence:\n`<<<I-1 A+2 L+1 A+1>>>`\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. \n\n**Answer: `<<<I-1 A+2 L+1 A+1>>>`**"
