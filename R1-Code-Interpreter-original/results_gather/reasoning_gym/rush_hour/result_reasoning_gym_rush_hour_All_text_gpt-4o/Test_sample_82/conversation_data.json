    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\nF..HBB\nFCCH.I\nAAG..I\n..GDDI\n..xx..\n...EEE\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented on the third row.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the Path for AA:**\n   - The red car (AA) needs to move right, but it is blocked by car G.\n   - Car G is vertically oriented and can move down.\n\n2. **Move G Down:**\n   - Move G down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n   - New position of G:\n     ```\n     F..HBB\n     FCCH.I\n     AA...I\n     ..GDDI\n     ..Gx..\n     ...EEE\n     ```\n\n3. **Move AA to the Exit:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move AA right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - New position of AA:\n     ```\n     F..HBB\n     FCCH.I\n     ....AA\n     ..GDDI\n     ..Gx..\n     ...EEE\n     ```\n\n### Final Moves:\n- G+1: Move car G down by 1 space.\n- A+3: Move car AA right by 3 spaces to the exit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<G+1 A+3>>>"
