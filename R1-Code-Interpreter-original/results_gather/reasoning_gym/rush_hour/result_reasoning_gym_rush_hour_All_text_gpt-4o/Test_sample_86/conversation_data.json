    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\n.BB.xM\n..JCCM\nAAJ.LM\nDD.KL.\nIEEKFF\nIGGGHH\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row and occupies columns 1 and 2.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- The red car needs to move right to reach the exit.\n- The path is blocked by the J car, which is vertically oriented and occupies columns 3 and 4 on rows 2 and 3.\n- The J car needs to be moved up to clear the path for the red car.\n- Moving the J car up will require moving the BB car, which is horizontally oriented and occupies row 1, columns 1 and 2.\n- The BB car can be moved left to clear the path for the J car.\n- The M car is vertically oriented and occupies column 5 on rows 1, 2, and 3. It needs to be moved down to allow the J car to move up.\n- The L car is horizontally oriented and occupies row 4, columns 4 and 5. It needs to be moved left to allow the M car to move down.\n- The K car is vertically oriented and occupies column 4 on rows 3 and 4. It needs to be moved up to allow the L car to move left.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. Move the L car left by 2 spaces: `L-2`\n   - New position of L: row 4, columns 2 and 3.\n2. Move the K car up by 1 space: `K-1`\n   - New position of K: column 4, rows 2 and 3.\n3. Move the M car down by 1 space: `M+1`\n   - New position of M: column 5, rows 2, 3, and 4.\n4. Move the J car up by 1 space: `J-1`\n   - New position of J: column 3, rows 1 and 2.\n5. Move the AA car right by 4 spaces to the exit: `A+4`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<L-2 K-1 M+1 J-1 A+4>>>`"
