    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nE..H..\nE..Hxx\nEAAIJ.\n.FGIJK\n.FGBBK\nCCDDD.\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify Movable Cars:**\n   - **E**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n   - **H**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n   - **I**: Horizontal, can move left or right.\n   - **J**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n   - **F**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n   - **G**: Horizontal, can move left or right.\n   - **B**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n   - **C**: Horizontal, can move left or right.\n   - **D**: Horizontal, can move left or right.\n\n2. **Initial Blockages:**\n   - The red car (AA) is blocked by car I on the right.\n   - Car I is blocked by car J below it.\n   - Car J is blocked by car B below it.\n\n3. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car B down to clear the path for car J.\n   - Move car J down to clear the path for car I.\n   - Move car I to the right to clear the path for car AA.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move B down by 1 space**: This clears the path for J.\n   - `B+1`\n2. **Move J down by 1 space**: This clears the path for I.\n   - `J+1`\n3. **Move I right by 1 space**: This clears the path for AA.\n   - `I+1`\n4. **Move AA right by 2 spaces**: This moves the red car to the exit.\n   - `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `B+1 J+1 I+1 A+2`\n\n**Answer:** `<<<B+1 J+1 I+1 A+2>>>`"
