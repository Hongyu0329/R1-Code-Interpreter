    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n- The exit is on the right side of the board, so we need to clear the path to the right of the red car.\n- The cars blocking the red car's path to the exit are K and C.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move K down**: \n   - K is vertically oriented and currently in the second and third rows, columns 5 and 6.\n   - Move K down by 1 space to clear the path for C to move right.\n   - Move: `K+1`\n\n2. **Move C right**:\n   - C is horizontally oriented and currently in the third row, columns 5 and 6.\n   - Move C right by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n   - Move: `C+1`\n\n3. **Move AA right**:\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\nCombining all the moves, we have:\n- `K+1 C+1 A+2`\n\nTherefore, the sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is:\n\n`<<<K+1 C+1 A+2>>>`"
