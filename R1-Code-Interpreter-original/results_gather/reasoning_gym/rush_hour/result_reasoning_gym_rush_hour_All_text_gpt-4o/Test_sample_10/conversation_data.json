    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   .xBBCC\n   ..x.K.\n   G.AAK.\n   G.IJDD\n   H.IJ..\n   HEEFFF\n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - Cars can only move in the direction they are oriented.\n   - Cars cannot move through walls or other cars.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Move car K down to free space for car AA.\n     - Move K down by 1: `K+1`\n     - New board:\n       ```\n       .xBBCC\n       ..x...\n       G.AAKK\n       G.IJDD\n       H.IJ..\n       HEEFFF\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 2:** Move car AA to the right.\n     - Move AA right by 2: `A+2`\n     - New board:\n       ```\n       .xBBCC\n       ..x...\n       G..KAA\n       G.IJDD\n       H.IJ..\n       HEEFFF\n       ```\n\n5. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - `K+1 A+2`\n\nThe red car (AA) is now at the exit. The sequence of moves required to achieve this is:\n\n**Answer:** <<<K+1 A+2>>>"
