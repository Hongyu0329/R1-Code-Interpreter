    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nxH.BBB\n.H.xKL\nAA.JKL\nGCCJ.M\nG.IDDM\nEEIFFF\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, starting from column 1 to column 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row, at column 6.\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path of AA:**\n   - The cars blocking the path of AA to the exit are J and L.\n\n4. **Plan to Move J and L:**\n   - J is vertically oriented and occupies columns 4 and 5 on rows 3 and 4.\n   - L is vertically oriented and occupies columns 5 and 6 on rows 2 and 3.\n\n5. **Move Sequence:**\n   - **Move J Down:** Move J down by 1 space to clear the path for L.\n     - J moves from rows 3-4 to rows 4-5.\n   - **Move L Down:** Move L down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n     - L moves from rows 2-3 to rows 3-4.\n   - **Move AA Right:** Move AA right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n     - AA moves from columns 1-2 to columns 5-6.\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n- J+1 (Move J down by 1 space)\n- L+1 (Move L down by 1 space)\n- A+4 (Move AA right by 4 spaces to the exit)\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<J+1 L+1 A+4>>>"
