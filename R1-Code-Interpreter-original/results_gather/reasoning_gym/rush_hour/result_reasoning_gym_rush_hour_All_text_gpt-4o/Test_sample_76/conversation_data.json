    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\nFBBBCC\nF.G.DD\nAAG.HI\n..G.HI\n.....J\nEEE..J\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented on the third row.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n\n1. **Clear the path for the red car (AA):**\n   - Move car G down to free space in front of the red car.\n     - G+1 (Move G down by 1 space)\n\n2. **Move the red car (AA) towards the exit:**\n   - A+2 (Move AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit)\n\n### Final Moves:\n- G+1 A+2\n\nThe red car (AA) is now at the exit. The moves required to achieve this are:\n\n**Answer: <<<G+1 A+2>>>**"
