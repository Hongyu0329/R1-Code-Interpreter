    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and located in the third row.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- The red car needs to move right to reach the exit.\n- Other vehicles and walls may block the path, so they need to be moved accordingly.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Identify Immediate Blockers:**\n   - The red car (AA) is blocked by the car (E) in the third row.\n   - Car (E) is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n\n2. **Free the Path for Car (E):**\n   - Move car (E) down to free the path for the red car (AA).\n   - Move E down by 1 space: `E+1`\n\n3. **Move the Red Car (AA):**\n   - Now that car (E) is moved, the red car (AA) can move right.\n   - Move AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Move E down by 1 space: `E+1`\n- Move AA right by 2 spaces: `A+2`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<E+1 A+2>>>`"
