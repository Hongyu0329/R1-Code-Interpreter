    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to exit the board.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the possible moves step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   BBBCCK\n   HDDJ.K\n   HAAJ.L\n   ..IEEL\n   FFI...\n   GGG..x\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n4. **Obstacles in the Path of the Red Car:**\n   - The red car needs to move right to reach the exit. The immediate obstacle is car J in column 4.\n\n5. **Plan to Move Car J:**\n   - Car J is vertically oriented and can move up or down. It is currently in columns 4 and 5, rows 2 and 3.\n\n6. **Freeing Car J:**\n   - Move car H up to free space for car J to move up.\n   - Move car D up to free space for car H to move up.\n\n7. **Move Car J:**\n   - Move car J up by 1 space to free the path for the red car.\n\n8. **Move the Red Car (AA):**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) to the right to the exit.\n\n**Step-by-Step Moves:**\n\n- Move H up by 1: `H-1`\n- Move D up by 1: `D-1`\n- Move J up by 1: `J-1`\n- Move AA right by 3: `A+3`\n\n**Final Answer:**\n`<<<H-1 D-1 J-1 A+3>>>`"
