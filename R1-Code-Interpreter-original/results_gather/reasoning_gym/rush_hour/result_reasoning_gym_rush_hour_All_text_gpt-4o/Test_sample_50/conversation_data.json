    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBCC.x\n.DDEEL\n.AA..L\nxFFK..\nI.JKGG\nI.JHH.\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, starting at column 1 and ending at column 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, at the far right (column 6).\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The red car needs to move right, but it is blocked by the car L in column 5.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car L down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Steps to Move Car L:**\n   - Car L is vertical, occupying positions (2,5) and (3,5).\n   - Move car L down by 2 spaces to positions (4,5) and (5,5).\n\n6. **Move the Red Car (AA):**\n   - Once car L is moved, the red car can move right to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move L down by 2 spaces:**\n   - L+2\n\n2. **Move AA right by 4 spaces to the exit:**\n   - A+4\n\n### Final Moves:\n- L+2 A+4\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is: \n\n**<<<L+2 A+4>>>**"
