    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the rightmost column and exit the board. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed:\n\n1. **Initial Board Analysis:**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, in the third row, column 6.\n   - The red car needs to move 3 spaces to the right to reach the exit.\n\n2. **Identify Blocking Vehicles:**\n   - The car I is blocking the red car from moving to the right. It is vertically oriented in columns 4 and 5, rows 2 and 3.\n   - The car K is also in the way, horizontally oriented in the first row, columns 5 and 6.\n\n3. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car I down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move car K to the left by 1 space to make room for car I to move down.\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move K left by 1 space: `K-1`\n   - Move I down by 1 space: `I+1`\n\n5. **Move the Red Car to the Exit:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) 3 spaces to the right: `A+3`\n\n6. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - Combine all the moves in the correct order to achieve the goal.\n\nThe final sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: `<<<K-1 I+1 A+3>>>`"
