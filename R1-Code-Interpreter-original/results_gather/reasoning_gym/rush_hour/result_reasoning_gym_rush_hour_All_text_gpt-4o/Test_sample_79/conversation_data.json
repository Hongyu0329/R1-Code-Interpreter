    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n- The cars and walls blocking the path of the red car are:\n  - J (vertically oriented) in column 4, rows 2-4.\n  - K (horizontally oriented) in row 2, columns 5-6.\n  - D (horizontally oriented) in row 2, columns 3-4.\n  - Walls (x) in row 2, columns 1-2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Move J down**: Move J down by 1 space to clear the path for D to move.\n   - Move: `J+1`\n   - New position of J: rows 3-5, column 4.\n\n2. **Move D left**: Move D left by 1 space to clear the path for K to move.\n   - Move: `D-1`\n   - New position of D: row 2, columns 2-3.\n\n3. **Move K up**: Move K up by 1 space to clear the path for AA to move.\n   - Move: `K-1`\n   - New position of K: row 1, columns 5-6.\n\n4. **Move AA right**: Move the red car (AA) right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+3`\n   - New position of AA: row 3, columns 5-6 (exit).\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<J+1 D-1 K-1 A+3>>>`"
