    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the steps needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\nx.BBCC\nDDx.KL\nI.AAKL\nIEEFFL\nGGGJ..\nHHHJ..\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- Cars and walls block the path of the red car. We need to move these out of the way.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the Path for AA:**\n   - The red car needs to move right, but it is blocked by the car K and L.\n   - Car K is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - Car L is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n\n2. **Move Car K:**\n   - Move car K down by 1 space to free the path for car L to move.\n   - This will make the board look like:\n     ```\n     x.BBCC\n     DDx..L\n     I.AAKL\n     IEEFFL\n     GGGJ.K\n     HHHJ..\n     ```\n\n3. **Move Car L:**\n   - Move car L down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - This will make the board look like:\n     ```\n     x.BBCC\n     DDx...\n     I.AAK.\n     IEEFFL\n     GGGJ.L\n     HHHJ.K\n     ```\n\n4. **Move the Red Car (AA):**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - This will make the board look like:\n     ```\n     x.BBCC\n     DDx...\n     I...AA\n     IEEFFL\n     GGGJ.L\n     HHHJ.K\n     ```\n\n### Final Moves:\n- K+1 (Move car K down by 1 space)\n- L+1 (Move car L down by 1 space)\n- A+3 (Move the red car AA to the right by 3 spaces)\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<K+1 L+1 A+3>>>"
