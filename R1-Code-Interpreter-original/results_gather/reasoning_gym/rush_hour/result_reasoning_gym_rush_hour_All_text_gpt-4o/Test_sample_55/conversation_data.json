    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nEBB.CC\nE.F..H\nAAF.GH\n....GI\n.xDDGI\n.....I\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is horizontally oriented and located on the third row, occupying columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Immediate Obstacles:**\n   - The car F is blocking the path of the red car (AA) on the third row.\n   - The car H is blocking the path of the car F on the second row.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car H down to free up space for car F.\n   - Move car F to the left to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move H Down:**\n   - Move car H down by 1 space to free up the second row.\n   - Move: `H+1`\n\n2. **Move F Left:**\n   - Move car F left by 1 space to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n   - Move: `F-1`\n\n3. **Move AA to the Exit:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine the moves in the specified format: `H+1 F-1 A+4`\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is: `<<<H+1 F-1 A+4>>>`"
