    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to exit the board on the right side.\n\nLet's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   ```\n   FBB.J.\n   F.I.JK\n   AAI..K\n   CCI..L\n   GHDDDL\n   GHEEx.\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Blockages:**\n   - The red car (AA) is blocked by the car I and the car K.\n   - Car I is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - Car K is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n\n3. **Plan Moves:**\n   - Move car I up to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move car K up to clear the path for the red car.\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move car I up by 1 space: `I-1`\n   - Move car K up by 1 space: `K-1`\n\n5. **Move the Red Car:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - Combine all moves: `I-1 K-1 A+3`\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully move the red car to the exit.\n\n**Answer:** <<<I-1 K-1 A+3>>>"
