    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n.EBBB.\n.E..F.\nAA..F.\n..CCC.\n..DDD.\n......\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is horizontally oriented and located on the third row.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The red car needs to move right, but it is blocked by the car 'F'.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move 'F' down to clear the path for 'AA'.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move F Down:**\n   - 'F' is vertically oriented and can be moved down.\n   - Move 'F' down by 2 spaces to clear the path for 'AA'.\n   - Move: `F+2`\n\n2. **Move AA to the Exit:**\n   - Now that 'F' is out of the way, move 'AA' right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `F+2 A+2`\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following these moves, the red car (AA) will reach the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer:** <<<F+2 A+2>>>"
