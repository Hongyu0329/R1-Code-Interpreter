    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nGBBIJL\nG.HIJL\nAAH.KL\nCCDDK.\n..x...\n.EEFF.\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, occupying columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The red car needs to move right, but the car H is blocking its path in column 3.\n   - Car H is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car H down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Additional Moves:**\n   - Ensure that moving car H does not block other necessary moves.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move H Down:**\n   - Move car H down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move: `H+1`\n\n2. **Move AA Right:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine the moves to achieve the objective.\n- Moves: `<<<H+1 A+4>>>`\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) can be moved to the exit on the right. The final answer is:\n\n`<<<H+1 A+4>>>`"
