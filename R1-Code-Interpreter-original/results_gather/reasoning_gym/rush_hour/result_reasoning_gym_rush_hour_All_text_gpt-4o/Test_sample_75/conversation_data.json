    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each car is represented by a letter, and the red car is represented by 'AA'. The goal is to clear a path for 'AA' to move to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Layout:**\n   ```\n   ....H.\n   .xBBH.\n   .AA.I.\n   CCFG.I.\n   E.FGDD\n   E.x...\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Position of the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car 'AA' is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically at row 3, column 6.\n\n4. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car needs to move right, but 'I' is blocking its path at row 3, column 5.\n   - 'H' is also blocking the path at row 2, column 5.\n\n5. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move 'I' down to clear the path for 'AA'.\n   - Move 'H' up to clear the path for 'AA'.\n\n6. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move 'I' down by 2 spaces: `I+2`\n   - Move 'H' up by 1 space: `H-1`\n   - Move 'AA' right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n7. **Final Moves:**\n   - `I+2 H-1 A+3`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car 'AA' can move to the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer: I+2 H-1 A+3**"
