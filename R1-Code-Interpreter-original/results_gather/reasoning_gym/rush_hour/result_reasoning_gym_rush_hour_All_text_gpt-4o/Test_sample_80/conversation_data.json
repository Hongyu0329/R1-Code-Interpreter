    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid with cars represented by letters, and the red car is horizontally oriented. We need to clear a path for the red car to move to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n2. **Immediate Obstacles:**\n   - The car 'I' is blocking the path of the red car. It is vertically oriented and located in the third column, rows 2 and 3.\n   - The car 'K' is also vertically oriented and located in the sixth column, rows 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to move 'I' and 'K' to clear the path for 'AA'.\n   - 'I' can be moved up or down, and 'K' can be moved up or down.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move 'I' up by 1 space to clear the path for 'AA'.\n   - Move 'K' up by 1 space to ensure it doesn't block the exit path.\n\n5. **Final Moves for 'AA':**\n   - Move 'AA' to the right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n\nLet's specify the moves in the required format:\n\n- Move 'I' up by 1 space: `I-1`\n- Move 'K' up by 1 space: `K-1`\n- Move 'AA' to the right by 4 spaces: `A+4`\n\nCombining these moves, we get the final sequence:\n\n`<<<I-1 K-1 A+4>>>`\n\nAnswer: <<<I-1 K-1 A+4>>>"
