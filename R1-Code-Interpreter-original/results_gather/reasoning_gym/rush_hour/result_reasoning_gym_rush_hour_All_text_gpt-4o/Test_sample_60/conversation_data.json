    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   BBICCx\n   ..IJDD\n   AAIJ.K\n   HEEFFK\n   H.GG..\n   ......\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Position of the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, starting from column 1 to column 2.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row, at column 6.\n\n4. **Identify Obstacles Blocking the Red Car:**\n   - The red car needs to move right, but it is blocked by the car 'I' and the car 'J'.\n\n5. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car 'I' down to free the path for 'AA'.\n   - Move car 'J' down to free the path for 'AA'.\n\n6. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move 'I' down by 1 space: `I+1`\n   - Move 'J' down by 1 space: `J+1`\n   - Now, the path is clear for the red car to move right.\n\n7. **Move the Red Car to the Exit:**\n   - Move 'AA' right by 4 spaces to reach the exit: `A+4`\n\n8. **Final Moves:**\n   - Combine all the moves: `I+1 J+1 A+4`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car can successfully reach the exit.\n\n**Answer: `<<<I+1 J+1 A+4>>>`**"
