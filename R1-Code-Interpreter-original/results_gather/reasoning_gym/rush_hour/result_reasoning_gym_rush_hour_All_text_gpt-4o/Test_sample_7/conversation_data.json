    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nE..x..\nEBBG..\nAAFG..\n..FCCC\n....H.\nxDDDH.\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by car F on its right.\n   - Car F is horizontally oriented and can move left or right.\n   - Car C is also horizontally oriented and can move left or right.\n   - Car G is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - Car H is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - Car D is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - Walls are present at specific locations and cannot be moved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move Car F:**\n   - Move car F to the right to clear the path for car AA.\n   - Move F+1 (F moves from columns 3-5 to 4-6).\n\n2. **Move Car C:**\n   - Move car C to the right to make space for car F.\n   - Move C+1 (C moves from columns 3-5 to 4-6).\n\n3. **Move Car G:**\n   - Move car G up to clear the path for car F.\n   - Move G-1 (G moves from row 2 to row 1).\n\n4. **Move Car F Again:**\n   - Move car F to the right to clear the path for car AA.\n   - Move F+1 (F moves from columns 4-6 to 5-7).\n\n5. **Move Car AA:**\n   - Move car AA to the right to the exit.\n   - Move AA+4 (AA moves from columns 1-2 to 5-6).\n\n### Final Moves:\n- F+1 C+1 G-1 F+1 AA+4\n\n**Answer: F+1 C+1 G-1 F+1 AA+4**"
