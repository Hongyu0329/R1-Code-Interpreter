    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - The red car (AA) is located at row 3, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The exit is at row 3, column 6.\n\n2. **Immediate Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car H at column 3.\n   - Car H is vertically oriented, so it can only move up or down.\n   - Below H, there is car K, which is also vertically oriented.\n\n3. **Plan to Clear Path:**\n   - We need to move car H down to clear the path for the red car.\n   - To move H down, we need to move car K down as well.\n   - Car K is blocked by car J, which is horizontally oriented.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move car J to the left to free up space for car K.\n   - Move car K down to free up space for car H.\n   - Move car H down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Execution of Moves:**\n   - Move J left by 1 space: `J-1`\n   - Move K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n   - Move H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n   - Now, the path is clear for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n6. **Final Move:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 4 spaces to reach the exit: `A+4`\n\nCombining all the moves, we have the following sequence:\n\n`<<<J-1 K+1 H+1 A+4>>>`\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car to the exit.\n\n**Answer:** <<<J-1 K+1 H+1 A+4>>>"
