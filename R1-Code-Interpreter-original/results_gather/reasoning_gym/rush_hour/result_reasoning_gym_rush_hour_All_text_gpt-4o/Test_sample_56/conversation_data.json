    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n..HBBB\n..HICC\n.AAIJK\n.GDDJK\n.GEEJL\nFF...L\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The goal is to move it to the right until it exits the board.\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car (I) in column 3.\n   - We need to move (I) out of the way to allow (AA) to move right.\n\n3. **Move Car (I):**\n   - Car (I) is vertical and can move up or down.\n   - Move (I) down by 1 space to free up the path for (AA).\n\n4. **Move Car (AA):**\n   - With (I) moved, (AA) can now move right.\n   - Move (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Moves:\n- Move (I) down by 1 space: `I+1`\n- Move (AA) right by 2 spaces: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n```\n<<<I+1 A+2>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
