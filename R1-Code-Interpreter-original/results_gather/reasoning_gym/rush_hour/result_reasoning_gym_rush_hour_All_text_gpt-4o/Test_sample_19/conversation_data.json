    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is on the right side of the board, at the third row, column 6.\n- The red car needs to move right to reach the exit.\n- The path is blocked by the car I, which is vertically oriented and located in columns 4 and 5, rows 2 and 3.\n- We need to move car I out of the way to allow the red car to move right.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move Car I Down:**\n   - Car I is blocking the path of the red car. We need to move it down to clear the path.\n   - Move I down by 1 space: `I+1`\n\n2. **Move Red Car (AA) Right:**\n   - Now that car I is moved down, the red car can move right.\n   - Move AA right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `AA+3`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `I+1 AA+3`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) will reach the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer:** <<<I+1 AA+3>>>"
