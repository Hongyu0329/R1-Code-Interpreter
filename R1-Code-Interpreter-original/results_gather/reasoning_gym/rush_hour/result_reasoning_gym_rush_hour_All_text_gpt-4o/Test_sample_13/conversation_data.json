    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid, and the red car is horizontally oriented on the third row. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the rightmost column and exit the board.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the positions of the cars:\n\n```\nG.IBBx\nG.IJCC\nHAAJ.K\nHDDD.K\nEEFF.K\n......\n```\n\n1. **Identify the position of the red car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify the exit path:**\n   - The red car needs to move to the right, but it is blocked by the car J and the wall 'x'.\n\n3. **Identify the blocking cars:**\n   - Car J is vertically oriented and is blocking the path of the red car.\n   - Car K is also vertically oriented and is blocking the path of car J.\n\n4. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move car J down to clear the path for the red car.\n   - To move car J down, we need to move car K down as well.\n\n5. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n   - Move car J down by 1 space: `J+1`\n   - Now, the path is clear for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n6. **Move the red car to the exit:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces: `A+3`\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully move the red car to the exit.\n\nFinal answer: `<<<K+1 J+1 A+3>>>`"
