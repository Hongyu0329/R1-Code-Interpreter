    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each car is represented by a letter, and the red car is represented by 'AA'. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move horizontally to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the possible moves step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   ..FGBB\n   ..FGCC\n   AAFGHI\n   ....HI\n   .....x\n   .DDEE.\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car 'F' in the third column.\n   - The car 'F' is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - The car 'G' is horizontally oriented and can move left or right.\n   - The car 'H' is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - The car 'I' is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - The car 'D' is horizontally oriented and can move left or right.\n   - The car 'E' is horizontally oriented and can move left or right.\n\n4. **Plan Moves to Clear Path for AA:**\n   - Move 'F' down to clear the path for 'AA'.\n   - Move 'G' left to make space for 'F'.\n   - Move 'H' and 'I' down to make space for 'G'.\n   - Move 'D' left to make space for 'E'.\n   - Move 'E' left to make space for 'D'.\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move 'F' down by 1 space: `F+1`\n   - Move 'G' left by 1 space: `G-1`\n   - Move 'H' down by 1 space: `H+1`\n   - Move 'I' down by 1 space: `I+1`\n   - Move 'D' left by 1 space: `D-1`\n   - Move 'E' left by 1 space: `E-1`\n   - Move 'AA' right by 4 spaces to the exit: `A+4`\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - `F+1 G-1 H+1 I+1 D-1 E-1 A+4`\n\nThe final answer, specifying the moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit, is:\n\n`<<<F+1 G-1 H+1 I+1 D-1 E-1 A+4>>>`"
