    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to exit the board.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the possible moves step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   ..BBBI\n   x.CCCI\n   AA.GHI\n   ...GH.\n   ..DDx.\n   ..EEFF\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located at row 3, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The exit is at row 3, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car G (vertically oriented) at row 3, column 4.\n   - Car G is blocked by car C (horizontally oriented) at row 2, column 4.\n   - Car C is blocked by car B (horizontally oriented) at row 1, column 3.\n\n4. **Plan Moves to Clear Path:**\n   - Move car B to the left to free up space for car C.\n   - Move car C to the left to free up space for car G.\n   - Move car G up to free up space for the red car.\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move B left by 1: `B-1`\n   - Move C left by 1: `C-1`\n   - Move G up by 1: `G-1`\n\n6. **Move the Red Car to the Exit:**\n   - Move AA right by 4: `A+4`\n\n7. **Final Moves Sequence:**\n   - `B-1 C-1 G-1 A+4`\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully move the red car to the exit.\n\n**Answer: `<<<B-1 C-1 G-1 A+4>>>`**"
