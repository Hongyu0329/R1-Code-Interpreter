    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nxBBHJK\nx..HJK\nFAAI.L\nFCCI.L\n..GDDL\n..GEEE\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles Blocking the Red Car:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car 'I' on its right.\n\n4. **Plan to Move Car 'I':**\n   - Car 'I' is vertically oriented and can be moved down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Identify Other Cars Blocking 'I':**\n   - Car 'I' is blocked by car 'L' below it.\n\n6. **Plan to Move Car 'L':**\n   - Car 'L' is vertically oriented and can be moved down.\n\n7. **Identify Other Cars Blocking 'L':**\n   - Car 'L' is blocked by car 'E' below it.\n\n8. **Plan to Move Car 'E':**\n   - Car 'E' is horizontally oriented and can be moved right.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. **Move Car 'E' Right:**\n   - Move 'E' right by 1 space to clear the path for 'L'.\n   - Move: `E+1`\n\n2. **Move Car 'L' Down:**\n   - Move 'L' down by 1 space to clear the path for 'I'.\n   - Move: `L+1`\n\n3. **Move Car 'I' Down:**\n   - Move 'I' down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move: `I+1`\n\n4. **Move the Red Car (AA) to the Exit:**\n   - Move 'AA' right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\n<<<E+1 L+1 I+1 A+2>>>\n```"
