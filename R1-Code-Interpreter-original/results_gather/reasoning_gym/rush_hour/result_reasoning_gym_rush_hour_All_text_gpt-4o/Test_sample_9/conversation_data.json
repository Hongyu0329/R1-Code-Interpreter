    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each letter represents a vehicle, and the red car (AA) is currently positioned horizontally. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, so we need to move AA to the right.\n\n2. **Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car G in the third row, column 3.\n   - The car G is vertically oriented, so it can only move up or down.\n   - The car C is horizontally oriented and is located in the fourth row, columns 4 and 5, blocking the path of G.\n   - The car J is vertically oriented and is located in the second, third, and fourth rows, column 6, blocking the path of C.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Move car J down to free up space for car C.\n   - Move car C to the right to free up space for car G.\n   - Move car G down to free up space for the red car (AA).\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right to the exit.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move J down by 1 space: `J+1`\n   - Move C to the right by 1 space: `C+1`\n   - Move G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n   - Move AA to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - `J+1 C+1 G+1 A+3`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) can be moved to the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer:** <<<J+1 C+1 G+1 A+3>>>"
