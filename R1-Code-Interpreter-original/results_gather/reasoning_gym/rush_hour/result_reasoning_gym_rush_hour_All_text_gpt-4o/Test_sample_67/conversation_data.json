    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBB.HI\n..F.HI\nAAF..J\nECC..J\nE.G..J\nx.GDDD\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car F on its right.\n   - Car F is located on the third row, column 3.\n\n4. **Plan to Move Car F:**\n   - Car F is a vertical car and can be moved up or down.\n   - Move car F down to free the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Move Car F:**\n   - Move F down by 1 space to the fourth row.\n\n6. **Move the Red Car (AA):**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Moves:\n- Move F down by 1 space: `F+1`\n- Move AA to the right by 3 spaces: `A+3`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<F+1 A+3>>>`"
