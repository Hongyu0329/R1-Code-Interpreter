    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   BBH.J.\n   ..HxJK\n   AAH..K\n   GCCC.K\n   GDDI..\n   EE.IFF\n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - Cars can only move in the direction they are oriented.\n   - Cars cannot move through other cars or walls.\n   - The red car (AA) is currently blocked by the H car.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Step 1:** Move the H car down to clear the path for the red car.\n     - Move H down by 1 space: `H+1`\n   - **Step 2:** Move the red car (AA) to the right.\n     - Move AA right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Combine the moves in the specified format: `H+1 A+3`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) will be able to move to the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer:** <<<H+1 A+3>>>"
