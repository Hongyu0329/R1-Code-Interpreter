    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\n.....x\nBB.xJ.\nFAAIJ.\nF.HICC\nG.HDDK\nGEEE.K\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to move to the right to exit.\n- The exit is located on the third row, sixth column.\n- The red car (AA) is currently in the third row, third and fourth columns.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the Path for AA:**\n   - The red car (AA) needs to move right, but the car J is blocking its path.\n   - Car J is vertically oriented and can move down.\n\n2. **Move J Down:**\n   - Move J down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n   - New position of J: (2,5) and (3,5).\n\n3. **Move AA to the Exit:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - New position of AA: (3,5) and (3,6).\n\n### Moves in Specified Format:\n- Move J down by 1: `J+1`\n- Move AA right by 2: `A+2`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<J+1 A+2>>>`"
