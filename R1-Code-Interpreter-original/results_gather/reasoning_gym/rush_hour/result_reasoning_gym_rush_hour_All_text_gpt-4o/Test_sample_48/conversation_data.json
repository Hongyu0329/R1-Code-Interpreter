    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nH.BBCC\nHDD..L\nIAA..L\nIEEE.L\nFFJKGG\n..JK..\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The goal is to move it to the right until it exits the board.\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by car 'L' on the third row, columns 5 and 6.\n   - To move 'AA' to the exit, we need to clear the path by moving 'L'.\n\n3. **Move Car 'L':**\n   - 'L' is vertically oriented and can be moved down.\n   - Move 'L' down by 2 spaces to clear the path for 'AA'.\n\n4. **Move Car 'AA':**\n   - With 'L' moved, 'AA' can now move to the right.\n   - Move 'AA' right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n\n- **Move 'L' down by 2 spaces:** `L+2`\n- **Move 'AA' right by 4 spaces:** `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\n\nCombining the moves, the sequence to solve the puzzle is:\n\n```\n<<<L+2 A+4>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
