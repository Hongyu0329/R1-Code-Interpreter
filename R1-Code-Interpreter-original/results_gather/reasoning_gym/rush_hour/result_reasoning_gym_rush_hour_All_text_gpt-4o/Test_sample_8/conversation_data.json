    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\n.HBBCC\n.H..K.\n.HAAKL\nDDI.KL\nG.IJEE\nGFFJ.x\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n- The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n- The red car needs to move two spaces to the right to reach the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Blockages:**\n   - The red car (AA) is blocked by the car K on its right.\n   - Car K is vertically oriented and occupies columns 5 and 6 on rows 2, 3, and 4.\n\n2. **Clear Path for Car K:**\n   - To move car K down, we need to clear space below it.\n   - Car L is blocking car K from moving down. Car L is vertically oriented and occupies column 5 on rows 3, 4, and 5.\n\n3. **Move Car L:**\n   - Move car L down by 1 space to free up space for car K.\n   - New position of car L: column 5, rows 4, 5, and 6.\n\n4. **Move Car K:**\n   - Now that car L has moved, move car K down by 1 space.\n   - New position of car K: column 5, rows 3, 4, and 5.\n\n5. **Move Red Car (AA):**\n   - With car K moved down, the red car can now move to the right.\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Final Moves:\n- L+1 (Move car L down by 1 space)\n- K+1 (Move car K down by 1 space)\n- A+2 (Move the red car AA right by 2 spaces to exit)\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<L+1 K+1 A+2>>>"
