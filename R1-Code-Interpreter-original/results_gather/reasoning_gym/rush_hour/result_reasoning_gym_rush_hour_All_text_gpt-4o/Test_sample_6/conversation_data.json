    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\nBBH.K.\n.GH.KL\n.GAAKL\nCCI..x\nF.IJDD\nFEEJ.x\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and located in the third row.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the Path for AA:**\n   - The car L is blocking the path of AA. We need to move L down to clear the path.\n   - Move L down by 2 spaces: `L+2`\n\n2. **Move AA to the Exit:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move AA to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n- **Move L down by 2 spaces:** This clears the path for AA.\n- **Move AA right by 3 spaces:** This moves the red car to the exit.\n\n### Final Moves:\nCombining the moves, we have:\n```\n<<<L+2 A+3>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. \n\n**Answer: <<<L+2 A+3>>>**"
