    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and located in the third row.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Identify Immediate Obstacles:**\n   - The car (I) is blocking the path of the red car (AA) to the exit.\n   - The car (K) is also in the way, as it is vertically oriented and blocks the path of (I).\n\n2. **Move Cars to Clear Path:**\n   - Move car (K) down to free up space for car (I) to move.\n   - Move car (I) to the right to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n\n3. **Sequence of Moves:**\n   - Move car (K) down by 1 space: `K+1`\n   - Move car (I) right by 1 space: `I+1`\n   - Move car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit: `A+2`\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n- The sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is: `K+1 I+1 A+2`\n\n**Answer:** `K+1 I+1 A+2`"
