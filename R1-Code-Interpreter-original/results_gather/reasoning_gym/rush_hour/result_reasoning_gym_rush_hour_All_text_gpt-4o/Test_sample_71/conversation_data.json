    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nHBBCCx\nH.IDDD\nAAIJ..\n.EEJFF\n.GGG.K\n.....K\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, starting from the first column.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car (I) on its right.\n   - The car (I) is blocked by the car (J) on its right.\n   - The car (J) is blocked by the car (F) on its right.\n\n4. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - We need to move the cars (I), (J), and (F) to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n\n5. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Move car (F) down to clear the path for car (J).\n   - Move car (J) to the right to clear the path for car (I).\n   - Move car (I) to the right to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n\n6. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move F down by 1: `F+1`\n   - Move J right by 1: `J+1`\n   - Move I right by 1: `I+1`\n   - Move AA right by 2 to reach the exit: `A+2`\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n```\n<<<F+1 J+1 I+1 A+2>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
