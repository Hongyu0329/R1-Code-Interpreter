    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nx.IBB.\n..IJCC\nAAIJK.\n.HDDKL\n.HEEEL\nFFGG..\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, occupying the first and second columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The red car needs to move right, but it is blocked by the car 'I' in the third column.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move the car 'I' down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Other Cars to Consider:**\n   - Cars 'B', 'C', 'J', 'K', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', and 'H' are also on the board, but they do not directly block the red car's path to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move Car 'I' Down:**\n   - Move 'I' down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move: `I+1`\n\n2. **Move Red Car (AA) Right:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine the moves to achieve the goal:\n  - `I+1 A+4`\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) can be moved to the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer: `<<<I+1 A+4>>>`**"
