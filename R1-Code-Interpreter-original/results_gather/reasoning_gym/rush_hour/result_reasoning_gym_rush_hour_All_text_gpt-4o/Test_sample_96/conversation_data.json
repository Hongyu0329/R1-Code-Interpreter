    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and needs to be moved to the rightmost column to exit. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\nBBCC.x\nDDJEEM\n..JAAM\nx.KFFM\n..KLGG\n.HHLII\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Position of the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 4 and 5.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit Path:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically in the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles Blocking the Red Car:**\n   - The car (M) is blocking the path of the red car (AA) in the third row, column 6.\n\n4. **Plan to Move the Blocking Car (M):**\n   - Car (M) is vertically oriented and occupies positions in the third, fourth, and fifth rows, column 6.\n   - To clear the path for the red car, we need to move car (M) down.\n\n5. **Move Car (M) Down:**\n   - Move car (M) down by 1 space to occupy positions in the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows, column 6.\n\n6. **Move the Red Car (AA) to the Exit:**\n   - With car (M) moved down, the red car (AA) can now move right by 1 space to reach the exit.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n- Move car (M) down by 1 space: `M+1`\n- Move the red car (AA) right by 1 space to the exit: `A+1`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<M+1 A+1>>>`"
