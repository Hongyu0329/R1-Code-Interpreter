    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid with cars and walls, and we need to carefully plan each move to clear a path for the red car. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBCCC.\n....HI\n..AAHI\n...GDD\n...G..\n.xEEFF\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is horizontally oriented and located at positions (2,2) and (2,3).\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically at position (2,5).\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - Cars and walls that block the path of the red car:\n     - Car H (vertically oriented) at (1,4) and (2,4).\n     - Car I (vertically oriented) at (1,5) and (2,5).\n     - Car G (vertically oriented) at (3,3), (4,3), and (5,3).\n     - Wall at (5,1).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - We need to clear the path for the red car by moving other cars out of the way.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move Car I Down:**\n   - Move car I down by 1 space to clear the exit path.\n   - `I+1`\n\n2. **Move Car H Down:**\n   - Move car H down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - `H+1`\n\n3. **Move Red Car (AA) Right:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine the moves into the specified format: `I+1 H+1 A+2`\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) can be moved to the exit on the right. The final answer is:\n\n`<<<I+1 H+1 A+2>>>`"
