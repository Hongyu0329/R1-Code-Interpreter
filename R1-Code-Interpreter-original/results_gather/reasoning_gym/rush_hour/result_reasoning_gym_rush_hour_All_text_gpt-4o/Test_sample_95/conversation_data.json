    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid with cars and walls, and each car can only move in its designated direction (horizontal or vertical). The goal is to clear a path for the red car to exit the board.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   ..BB..\n   xCC.x.\n   AAG...\n   F.GDD.\n   FEEH..\n   F..H..\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Movable Cars:**\n   - **AA**: Horizontal, needs to move right to exit.\n   - **BB**: Horizontal, can move left or right.\n   - **CC**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n   - **DD**: Horizontal, can move left or right.\n   - **EE**: Horizontal, can move left or right.\n   - **FF**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n   - **GG**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n   - **HH**: Vertical, can move up or down.\n\n3. **Plan Moves:**\n   - **Step 1**: Move **BB** left to clear the path for **AA**.\n     - Move **BB** left by 2 spaces: `B-2`\n   - **Step 2**: Move **CC** up to clear the path for **GG**.\n     - Move **CC** up by 1 space: `C-1`\n   - **Step 3**: Move **GG** up to clear the path for **AA**.\n     - Move **GG** up by 1 space: `G-1`\n   - **Step 4**: Move **DD** right to clear the path for **AA**.\n     - Move **DD** right by 1 space: `D+1`\n   - **Step 5**: Move **AA** right to the exit.\n     - Move **AA** right by 3 spaces: `A+3`\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - `B-2 C-1 G-1 D+1 A+3`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) can be moved to the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer: `<<<B-2 C-1 G-1 D+1 A+3>>>`**"
