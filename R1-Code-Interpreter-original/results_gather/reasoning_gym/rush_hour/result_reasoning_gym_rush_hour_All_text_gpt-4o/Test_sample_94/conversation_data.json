    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each car is represented by a letter, and the red car is represented by 'AA'. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the possible moves:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   ..D...\n   ..DBBB\n   .AAE.F\n   ...E.F\n   .CCx.F\n   ......\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The car 'E' is blocking the path of the red car.\n   - The car 'F' is also in the way, but it is further to the right.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - We need to move 'E' down to clear the path for 'AA'.\n   - 'F' needs to be moved to the right to make space for 'E' to move down.\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move 'F' to the right by 1 space: `F+1`\n     ```\n     ..D...\n     ..DBBB\n     .AAE..\n     ...E.F\n     .CCx.F\n     ......\n     ```\n   - Move 'E' down by 1 space: `E+1`\n     ```\n     ..D...\n     ..DBBB\n     .AA...\n     ...EEF\n     .CCx.F\n     ......\n     ```\n   - Move 'AA' to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n     ```\n     ..D...\n     ..DBBB\n     ......\n     ...EEF\n     .CCx.F\n     ......\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The red car (AA) has reached the exit.\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: `F+1 E+1 A+3`\n\nAnswer: <<<F+1 E+1 A+3>>>"
