    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\nHIBBCC\nHIJ...\nAAJ..L\nDDJK.L\nxEEK.L\n.FFGG.\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row and needs to move to the right to exit.\n- The exit is located at the far right of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car to move to the right.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the Path for AA:**\n   - The car J is blocking AA from moving to the right. J is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - Move J down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n\n2. **Move AA to the Right:**\n   - Now that J is out of the way, move AA to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n\n- **Move J down by 1 space:** This will clear the path for AA.\n- **Move AA to the right by 3 spaces:** This will allow AA to reach the exit.\n\n### Final Moves:\n\n- J+1 (Move J down by 1 space)\n- A+3 (Move AA to the right by 3 spaces)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is:\n\n**<<<J+1 A+3>>>**"
