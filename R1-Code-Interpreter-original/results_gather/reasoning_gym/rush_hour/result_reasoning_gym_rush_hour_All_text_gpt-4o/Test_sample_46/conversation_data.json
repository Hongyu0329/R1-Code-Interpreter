    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nxBBB.I\n.CC..I\n..GAAI\n..GHDD\n..GHEE\n.FFx..\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the position and orientation of each car:**\n   - **B**: Horizontal, top row.\n   - **C**: Vertical, second column.\n   - **D**: Horizontal, fourth row.\n   - **E**: Horizontal, fifth row.\n   - **F**: Vertical, first column.\n   - **G**: Vertical, third column.\n   - **H**: Vertical, fourth column.\n   - **I**: Vertical, sixth column.\n   - **AA**: Horizontal, third row.\n\n2. **Identify obstacles blocking the red car (AA):**\n   - The car (I) is blocking the exit path of AA.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - **Step 1**: Move car (I) down to clear the path for AA.\n   - **Step 2**: Move car (AA) to the right to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n- **Move I down by 2 spaces**: This clears the path for AA.\n- **Move AA right by 3 spaces**: This moves AA to the exit.\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `I+2 AA+3`\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: `I+2 AA+3`."
