    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid with cars represented by letters, and the red car is represented by 'AA'. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move horizontally to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   ..BBBI\n   ....HI\n   AA..HI\n   CCC.H.\n   .GDDEE\n   .G.FF.\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, starting from the first column.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, aligned with the row where the red car is located.\n\n4. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the 'B' car and the 'C' car.\n   - The 'B' car is horizontal and located on the first row.\n   - The 'C' car is vertical and located on the fourth column.\n\n5. **Plan Moves to Clear Path:**\n   - Move the 'B' car to the left to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move the 'C' car down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n6. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move 'B' left by 1 space: `B-1`\n   - Move 'C' down by 1 space: `C+1`\n\n7. **Move the Red Car to the Exit:**\n   - Move 'AA' right by 4 spaces: `A+4`\n\n8. **Final Moves:**\n   - Combine all moves: `B-1 C+1 A+4`\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully move the red car to the exit.\n\n**Answer:** <<<B-1 C+1 A+4>>>"
