    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nG..IBB\nG.HI.J\nG.HAAJ\nCCDD.K\nEEEFFK\n......\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the position of the red car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 4 and 5.\n\n2. **Identify obstacles blocking the red car:**\n   - The car J is blocking the red car from moving to the right.\n   - The car J is located on the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Plan to move the blocking car (J):**\n   - Car J is horizontally oriented and can be moved to the right.\n\n4. **Identify other cars that need to be moved to free car J:**\n   - Car K is blocking car J from moving to the right.\n   - Car K is vertically oriented and can be moved down.\n\n5. **Plan to move car K:**\n   - Car K is located on the fourth and fifth rows, column 6.\n   - Move car K down by 1 space to free car J.\n\n6. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n   - Move car J to the right by 1 space: `J+1`\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 2 spaces to exit: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `K+1 J+1 A+2`\n\nThe red car (AA) can now exit the board. \n\n**Answer:** <<<K+1 J+1 A+2>>>"
