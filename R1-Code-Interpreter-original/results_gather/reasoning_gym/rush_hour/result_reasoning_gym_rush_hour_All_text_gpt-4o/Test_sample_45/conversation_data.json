    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed to clear a path for the red car to exit.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBH.CC\n.GH..K\n.GAAJK\nDD.IJL\n...IxL\n.EEFFL\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles Blocking the Red Car:**\n   - The cars J and K are blocking the path of the red car to the exit.\n\n4. **Plan to Move Blocking Cars:**\n   - Car J is vertically oriented and can be moved down.\n   - Car K is horizontally oriented and can be moved right.\n\n5. **Execute Moves to Clear Path:**\n   - Move car J down by 1 space to clear the path for car K.\n   - Move car K right by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n\n6. **Move the Red Car to the Exit:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n\n- **Move J down by 1:** J+1\n- **Move K right by 1:** K+1\n- **Move AA right by 2:** A+2\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n```\n<<<J+1 K+1 A+2>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
