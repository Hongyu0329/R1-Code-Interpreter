    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- The red car needs to move to the right to reach the exit.\n- The cars blocking the red car's path are:\n  - G (in the third row, column 3)\n  - I (in the third row, column 4)\n  - J (in the third row, column 5)\n  - K (in the third row, column 6)\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move G down**: \n   - G is currently in the third row, column 3. \n   - Move G down by 2 spaces to the fifth row, column 3.\n   - Move: `G+2`\n\n2. **Move I down**:\n   - I is currently in the third row, column 4.\n   - Move I down by 2 spaces to the fifth row, column 4.\n   - Move: `I+2`\n\n3. **Move J down**:\n   - J is currently in the third row, column 5.\n   - Move J down by 2 spaces to the fifth row, column 5.\n   - Move: `J+2`\n\n4. **Move K down**:\n   - K is currently in the third row, column 6.\n   - Move K down by 2 spaces to the fifth row, column 6.\n   - Move: `K+2`\n\n5. **Move AA to the right**:\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) to the right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\nCombine all the moves in the specified format:\n`<<<G+2 I+2 J+2 K+2 A+4>>>`\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
