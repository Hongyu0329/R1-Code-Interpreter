    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid with cars and walls, and each car can only move in its designated orientation (horizontal or vertical). The goal is to clear a path for the red car to exit the board.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the possible moves step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   ..xBBJ\n   CCCDDJ\n   ..AA.K\n   G.HEEK\n   G.HIFF\n   ...I..\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, third and fourth columns.\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Immediate Obstacles:**\n   - The car K is blocking the exit path for AA.\n   - The car J is also in the way, as it is vertically aligned and blocks the path of K.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move J down to free up space for K.\n   - Move K to the right to clear the path for AA.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move J down by 1 space: `J+1`\n     ```\n     ..xBB.\n     CCCDD.\n     ..AA.J\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n   - Move K to the right by 1 space: `K+1`\n     ```\n     ..xBB.\n     CCCDD.\n     ..AA..\n     G.HEEKK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n   - Now, move AA to the right by 2 spaces to exit: `A+2`\n     ```\n     ..xBB.\n     CCCDD.\n     ......\n     G.HEEKK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - J+1 K+1 A+2\n\nThe final answer to move the red car (AA) to the exit is: `<<<J+1 K+1 A+2>>>`"
