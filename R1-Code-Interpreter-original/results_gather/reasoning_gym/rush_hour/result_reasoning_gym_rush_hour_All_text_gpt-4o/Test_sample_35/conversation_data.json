    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n..BBB.\n...FG.\nAA.FG.\nE..FH.\nECCCH.\nE.DD..\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, starting from the first column.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically at the third row, sixth column.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car F in the third row, fourth column.\n   - Car F is part of a vertical car (F) that also occupies the second and third rows in the fourth column.\n   - Car G is also in the way, occupying the second and third rows in the fifth column.\n\n4. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - We need to move car F and car G to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move car F up by 1 space to free the third row: `F-1`\n   - Move car G up by 1 space to free the third row: `G-1`\n   - Now, the path is clear for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n6. **Move the Red Car (AA) to the Exit:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 4 spaces to reach the exit: `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `F-1 G-1 A+4`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<F-1 G-1 A+4>>>`"
