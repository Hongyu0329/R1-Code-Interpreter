    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nGBB.KL\nGHI.KL\nGHIAAM\nCCCJ.M\n..xJDD\nEEFF..\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 5 and 6.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically at the end of the third row.\n\n3. **Immediate Obstacles:**\n   - The car (M) is blocking the exit path of the red car (AA).\n\n4. **Plan to Move Car (M):**\n   - Car (M) is located on the third row, column 6, and fourth row, column 6. It needs to be moved down to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n\n5. **Move Car (M) Down:**\n   - Move car (M) down by 1 space to the fourth and fifth rows, column 6.\n\n6. **Move Red Car (AA) to the Exit:**\n   - With car (M) moved, the red car (AA) can now move right by 1 space to reach the exit.\n\n### Moves:\n- Move car (M) down by 1 space: `M+1`\n- Move red car (AA) right by 1 space to the exit: `A+1`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<M+1 A+1>>>`"
