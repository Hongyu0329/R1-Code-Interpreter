    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n.IBBBx\nGI.JCC\nGAAJK.\nG.DDKL\nH.xEEL\nHFFF..\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Immediate Obstacles:**\n   - The car (J) is blocking the red car from moving to the right.\n   - The car (C) is blocking the car (J) from moving down.\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car (C) down to free space for car (J).\n   - Move car (J) down to free space for the red car (AA).\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move C Down:**\n   - Move car (C) down by 1 space to free the path for car (J).\n   - New position of C: `GI.J..` and `G.DDKL` becomes `G.DDCL`.\n\n2. **Move J Down:**\n   - Move car (J) down by 1 space to free the path for the red car (AA).\n   - New position of J: `GAAK..` and `G.DDCL` becomes `G.DDJL`.\n\n3. **Move AA to the Exit:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - New position of AA: `G..KAA`.\n\n### Final Moves:\n- C+1 J+1 A+2\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) can be moved to the exit on the right. The final answer with the specified moves is:\n\n**<<<C+1 J+1 A+2>>>**"
