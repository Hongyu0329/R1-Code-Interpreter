    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nEBBCCC\nE....H\nF.xAAH\nF.G...\n..GDDD\n......\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 4 and 5.\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, so we need to clear the path to the right.\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The car H is blocking the path of AA to the right.\n   - The car G is below AA and might need to be moved to allow other cars to move.\n\n3. **Plan Moves:**\n   - Move H down to clear the path for AA.\n   - Move G down to allow H to move.\n   - Move AA to the right to the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n\n1. **Move H Down:**\n   - Move H down by 2 spaces to clear the path for AA.\n   - Move: `H+2`\n\n2. **Move G Down:**\n   - Move G down by 1 space to allow H to move.\n   - Move: `G+1`\n\n3. **Move AA to the Right:**\n   - Move AA to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves Sequence:\n- Combine the moves in the specified format: `H+2 G+1 A+2`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<H+2 G+1 A+2>>>`"
