    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid with cars represented by letters, and the red car is horizontally oriented. We need to clear a path for the red car to move to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   BBBCC.\n   ..HIDD\n   AAHIJK\n   GEEEJK\n   G.FF.x\n   ......\n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the rightmost column.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - Cars can only move in the direction they are oriented.\n   - Cars cannot move through walls or other cars.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Move car 'H' down by 1 space to clear the path for 'AA'.\n     ```\n     BBBCC.\n     ....DD\n     AAHIJK\n     GEEEJK\n     G.FF.x\n     ..H...\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 2:** Move car 'I' down by 1 space to clear the path for 'AA'.\n     ```\n     BBBCC.\n     ....DD\n     AAH.JK\n     GEEEJK\n     G.FF.x\n     ..HI..\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 3:** Move car 'J' down by 1 space to clear the path for 'AA'.\n     ```\n     BBBCC.\n     ....DD\n     AAH..K\n     GEEEJK\n     G.FF.x\n     ..HIJ.\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 4:** Move car 'K' down by 1 space to clear the path for 'AA'.\n     ```\n     BBBCC.\n     ....DD\n     AAH...\n     GEEEJK\n     G.FF.x\n     ..HIJK\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 5:** Move car 'AA' to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n     ```\n     BBBCC.\n     ....DD\n     ..HAA.\n     GEEEJK\n     G.FF.x\n     ..HIJK\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - H+1\n   - I+1\n   - J+1\n   - K+1\n   - A+3\n\n**Answer:**\n<<<H+1 I+1 J+1 K+1 A+3>>>"
