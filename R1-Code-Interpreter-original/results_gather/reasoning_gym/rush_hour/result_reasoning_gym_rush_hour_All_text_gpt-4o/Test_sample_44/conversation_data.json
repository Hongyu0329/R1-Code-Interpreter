    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nxBBHJK\nFCCHJK\nFAAI.L\nF..I.L\n..GDDL\nEEG...\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the position of the red car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify obstacles in the path of the red car:**\n   - The red car needs to move to the right, but it is blocked by car I in column 4.\n\n3. **Plan to clear the path for the red car:**\n   - Move car I down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n4. **Identify other cars that need to be moved:**\n   - Car L is in the way of moving car I down, so we need to move car L to the right.\n\n5. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move car L to the right by 1 space.\n   - Move car I down by 1 space.\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move L right by 1 space:**\n   - L moves from columns 5-6 to columns 6-7.\n\n2. **Move I down by 1 space:**\n   - I moves from rows 2-3 to rows 3-4.\n\n3. **Move AA right by 3 spaces:**\n   - AA moves from columns 2-3 to columns 5-6, exiting the board.\n\n### Final Moves:\n- L+1 I+1 A+3\n\n**Answer: <<<L+1 I+1 A+3>>>**"
