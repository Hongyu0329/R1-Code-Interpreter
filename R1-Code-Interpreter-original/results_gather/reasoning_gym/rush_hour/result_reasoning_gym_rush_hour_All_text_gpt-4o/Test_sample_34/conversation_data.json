    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nGBBB..\nG..IJ.\nHAAIJ.\nH.....\nHxCCDD\nEEFF..\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically at the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car IJ on its right.\n   - The car IJ is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - The car H is vertically oriented and can move up or down.\n   - The car C is horizontally oriented and can move left or right.\n   - The car D is horizontally oriented and can move left or right.\n\n4. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move the car IJ down to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move the car H up to make space for IJ to move.\n   - Move the car C left to make space for D to move.\n   - Move the car D left to make space for C to move.\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n\n- **Move 1:** Move car H up by 1 space to make room for IJ.\n  - `H-1`\n- **Move 2:** Move car IJ down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n  - `I+1 J+1`\n- **Move 3:** Move car C left by 1 space to make room for D.\n  - `C-1`\n- **Move 4:** Move car D left by 1 space to make room for C.\n  - `D-1`\n- **Move 5:** Move car AA right by 3 spaces to the exit.\n  - `A+3`\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\nCombining all the moves, we get the following sequence:\n\n`<<<H-1 I+1 J+1 C-1 D-1 A+3>>>`\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
