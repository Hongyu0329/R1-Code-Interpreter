    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid, and the red car is horizontally oriented, located in the third row. The exit is on the right side of the board, so we need to clear a path for the red car to move to the right.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the positions of the cars:\n\n```\n1. BBBF..\n2. CCCF..\n3. .AAF..\n4. ..E...\n5. ..EDDD\n6. ......\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is in row 3, columns 2 and 3.\n- The exit is at row 3, column 6.\n- The cars are:\n  - B: Horizontally oriented in row 1, columns 1-3.\n  - C: Horizontally oriented in row 2, columns 1-3.\n  - F: Vertically oriented in column 4, rows 1-3.\n  - E: Vertically oriented in column 3, rows 4-5.\n  - D: Horizontally oriented in row 5, columns 4-6.\n\nTo move the red car to the exit, we need to clear the path in row 3, columns 4-6. The car F is blocking the path in column 4, so we need to move it down. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Move car F down by 1 space to clear column 4 in row 3.\n   - Move: `F+1`\n\n2. Now, the red car (AA) can move to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+3`\n\nCombining these moves, we have the solution:\n\n`<<<F+1 A+3>>>`\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car to the exit. \n\nAnswer: <<<F+1 A+3>>>"
