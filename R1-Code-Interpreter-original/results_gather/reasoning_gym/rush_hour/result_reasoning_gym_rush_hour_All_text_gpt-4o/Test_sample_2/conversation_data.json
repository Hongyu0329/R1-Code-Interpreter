    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to exit the board on the right side.\n\nLet's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   BBH.CC\n   G.H.JK\n   G.AAJK\n   DD.IxL\n   EE.I.L\n   FFF..x\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit Path:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row. The red car needs to move to the right to reach the exit.\n\n4. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The cars JK and L are blocking the path of the red car. We need to move these cars to clear the path.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - **Move JK Down:** Move car JK down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n     - Move: `K+1`\n   - **Move L Down:** Move car L down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n     - Move: `L+1`\n   - **Move AA Right:** Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n     - Move: `A+2`\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - Combine the moves in the specified format: `K+1 L+1 A+2`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car (AA) can successfully reach the exit.\n\n**Answer:** <<<K+1 L+1 A+2>>>"
