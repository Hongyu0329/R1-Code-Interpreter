    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n.F.IBB\n.F.I.J\n.GAA.J\n.GCCCJ\n.GHDDD\n..H.EE\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the position of the red car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify the exit path:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify obstacles in the path of the red car:**\n   - The car J is blocking the path of the red car at column 5.\n\n4. **Plan to clear the path:**\n   - Move car J down to clear the path for the red car.\n\n5. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move car J down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n\n6. **Move the red car to the exit:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n- **Move J down by 1 space:** `J+1`\n- **Move AA right by 3 spaces:** `A+3`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `J+1 A+3`\n\n**Answer:** `<<<J+1 A+3>>>`"
