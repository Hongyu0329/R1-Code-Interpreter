    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n- The exit is on the right side of the board, so we need to clear the path to the right of the red car.\n- The red car is blocked by the car (I) in column 5 and the car (J) in column 6.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Move Car J Down:**\n   - Car J is vertical and occupies columns 6, rows 3 to 5.\n   - Move J down by 1 space to clear the path for car I.\n   - New position of J: columns 6, rows 4 to 6.\n\n2. **Move Car I Right:**\n   - Car I is horizontal and occupies row 3, columns 5.\n   - Move I right by 1 space to clear the path for car AA.\n   - New position of I: row 3, column 6.\n\n3. **Move Car AA Right:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move car AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - New position of AA: row 3, columns 5 and 6.\n\n### Final Moves:\n- J+1 (Move car J down by 1 space)\n- I+1 (Move car I right by 1 space)\n- A+2 (Move car AA right by 2 spaces to the exit)\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<J+1 I+1 A+2>>>"
