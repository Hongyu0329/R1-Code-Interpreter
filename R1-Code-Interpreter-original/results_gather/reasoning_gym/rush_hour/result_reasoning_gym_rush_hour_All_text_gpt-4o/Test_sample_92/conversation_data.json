    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Board Layout:**\n   ```\n   ..xBBB\n   GHI.CC\n   GHIAAK\n   DDDJ.K\n   ...JEE\n   .FFF.x\n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - Cars can only move in the direction they are oriented.\n   - Cars cannot move through walls or other cars.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Move car K down to clear the path for car AA.\n     - Move K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n     - New board:\n       ```\n       ..xBBB\n       GHI.CC\n       GHIAA.\n       DDDJ.K\n       ...JEE\n       .FFF.x\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 2:** Move car AA to the right to the exit.\n     - Move AA right by 2 spaces: `A+2`\n     - New board:\n       ```\n       ..xBBB\n       GHI.CC\n       GHIA..\n       DDDJAK\n       ...JEE\n       .FFF.x\n       ```\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - `K+1 A+2`\n\nThe red car (AA) has been moved to the exit on the right. The final answer with the moves is:\n\n`<<<K+1 A+2>>>`"
