    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nGBBB..\nG.HCC.\nAAH...\n..HDDx\nEEEI..\n.FFI..\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, occupying the first and second columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, sixth column.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car needs a clear path to move to the right.\n   - The car H is blocking the path of the red car.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - We need to move the car H out of the way to allow the red car to move to the right.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move Car H:**\n   - Car H is vertical and located in the second and third columns of the second and third rows.\n   - Move H down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Move: `H+1`\n\n2. **Move Red Car (AA):**\n   - Now that H is moved, the red car can move to the right.\n   - Move AA to the right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - Move: `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- Combine the moves to achieve the objective.\n- Moves: `<<<H+1 A+4>>>`\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe red car (AA) can be moved to the exit with the following moves: `<<<H+1 A+4>>>`."
