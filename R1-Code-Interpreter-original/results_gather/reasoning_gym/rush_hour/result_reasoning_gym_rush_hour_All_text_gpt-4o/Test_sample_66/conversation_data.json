    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves required to achieve this.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\nx.GBBJ\nCCGHIJ\nFAAHIK\nFDD.IK\nEE.x..\n......\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and located on the third row.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the Path for AA:**\n   - The red car (AA) is blocked by the car (H) on the third row.\n   - We need to move (H) out of the way.\n\n2. **Move Car H:**\n   - Car (H) is vertically oriented and can be moved up or down.\n   - Move (H) down by 2 spaces to clear the path for (AA).\n\n3. **Move Car AA:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move the red car (AA) to the right to the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n\n- **Move H down by 2 spaces:** This clears the path for the red car.\n- **Move AA right by 3 spaces:** This moves the red car to the exit.\n\n### Final Move Sequence:\n\n- Move H down by 2 spaces: `H+2`\n- Move AA right by 3 spaces: `A+3`\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is:\n\n`<<<H+2 A+3>>>`"
