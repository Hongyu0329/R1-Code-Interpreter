    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid, and the red car is horizontally oriented on the third row. The exit is on the right side of the third row. We need to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the positions of the cars:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   E.FBBJ\n   E.F.IJ\n   EAAGIK\n   ...G.K\n   CC.H.K\n   DDDH..\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n4. **Identify Obstacles Blocking the Red Car:**\n   - The car G is blocking the path of the red car. It is vertically oriented and located in columns 4 and 5, rows 3 and 4.\n   - The car K is also blocking the path. It is vertically oriented and located in column 6, rows 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n5. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - First, we need to move car G down to clear the path for the red car.\n   - Then, move car K down to clear the exit path.\n\n6. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move G down by 1 space: `G+1`\n   - Move K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n7. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: `G+1 K+1 A+3`\n\n**Answer: `<<<G+1 K+1 A+3>>>`**"
