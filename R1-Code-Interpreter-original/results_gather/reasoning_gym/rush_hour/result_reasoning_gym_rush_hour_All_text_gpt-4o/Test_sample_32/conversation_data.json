    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n...HI.\nBBBHI.\nAA.HJ.\nF.CCJ.\nF.GDD.\nEEG...\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car (H) in column 4 on the third row.\n   - The car (H) is part of a vertical car (HI) that extends to the first and second rows.\n\n4. **Plan Moves to Clear the Path:**\n   - We need to move the car (H) out of the way to allow the red car to move to the right.\n\n5. **Move Analysis:**\n   - **Move 1:** Move car (H) up by 2 spaces to clear the path for the red car.\n     - This will move (H) from row 3 to row 1, column 4.\n   - **Move 2:** Move the red car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Execute Moves:\n\n- **Move 1:** H-2 (Move car H up by 2 spaces)\n  - New position of H: \n    ```\n    ...H..\n    BBBH..\n    AA..J.\n    F.CCJ.\n    F.GDD.\n    EEG...\n    ```\n\n- **Move 2:** A+2 (Move red car AA right by 2 spaces)\n  - New position of AA:\n    ```\n    ...H..\n    BBBH..\n    ..AAJ.\n    F.CCJ.\n    F.GDD.\n    EEG...\n    ```\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit is: <<<H-2 A+2>>>"
