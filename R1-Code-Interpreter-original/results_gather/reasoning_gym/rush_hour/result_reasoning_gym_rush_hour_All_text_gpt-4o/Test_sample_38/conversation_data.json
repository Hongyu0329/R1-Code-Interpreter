    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the possible moves step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   G.JBB.\n   G.JK.L\n   HAAK.L\n   HICC.x\n   HIDD..\n   EEEFF.\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n4. **Obstacles in the Path of the Red Car:**\n   - The cars K and L are blocking the path of the red car to the exit.\n\n5. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car K down to free the path for the red car.\n   - Move car L to the right to clear the exit.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n   - Move car L to the right by 1 space: `L+1`\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n7. **Final Moves:**\n   - `K+1 L+1 A+3`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car can reach the exit without any obstacles.\n\n**Answer: `K+1 L+1 A+3`**"
