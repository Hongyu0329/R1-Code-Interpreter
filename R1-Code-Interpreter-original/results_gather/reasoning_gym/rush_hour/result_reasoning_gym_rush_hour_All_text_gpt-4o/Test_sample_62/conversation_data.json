    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nGBB.LM\nGHI.LM\nGHIAAN\nCCJK.N\n..JKDD\n.EEFF.\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 5 and 6.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, which means we need to clear the path for the red car to move to the right.\n\n3. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The car (N) is blocking the path of the red car (AA) at position (3,6).\n   - The car (M) is blocking the path at position (1,6) and (2,6).\n\n4. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car (N) down to clear the path for (AA).\n   - Move car (M) up to clear the path for (AA).\n\n5. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move car (N) down by 1 space: `N+1`\n   - Move car (M) up by 2 spaces: `M-2`\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 1 space: `A+1`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `N+1 M-2 A+1`\n\nBy executing these moves, the red car (AA) will reach the exit on the right.\n\n**Answer: `<<<N+1 M-2 A+1>>>`**"
