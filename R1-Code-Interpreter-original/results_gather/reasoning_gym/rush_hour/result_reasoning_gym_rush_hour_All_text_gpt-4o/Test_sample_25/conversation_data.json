    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n.FBBB.\n.F.CCH\n.FAAGH\n....G.\nDDDEE.\n......\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically at the third row, column 6.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car (AA) is blocked by the car (H) on its right.\n   - Car (H) is horizontally oriented and can be moved to the right.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - Move car (H) to the right to clear the path for the red car (AA).\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move car (H) right by 1 space: `H+1`\n   - Now, the red car (AA) can move to the right.\n\n6. **Move the Red Car (AA) to the Exit:**\n   - Move car (AA) right by 2 spaces to reach the exit: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\n- `H+1 A+2`\n\n### Final Answer:\n`<<<H+1 A+2>>>`"
