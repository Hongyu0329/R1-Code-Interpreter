    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the steps needed to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   BBCC.x\n   ...KDD\n   xAAK.L\n   EEJFFL\n   ..J.GG\n   .HHHII\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n\n4. **Obstacles in the Path of the Red Car:**\n   - The car K is blocking the red car from moving to the right.\n   - The car L is also in the path of the red car.\n\n5. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car K down to free the path for the red car.\n   - Move car L down to clear the exit path.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move car K down by 1 space: `K+1`\n   - Move car L down by 1 space: `L+1`\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n7. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - After moving K and L, the board will look like this:\n     ```\n     BBCC.x\n     .....D\n     xAA..D\n     EEJFFL\n     ..J.GG\n     .HHHII\n     ```\n   - Now, move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n8. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - `K+1 L+1 A+3`\n\nThe final answer is: `<<<K+1 L+1 A+3>>>`"
