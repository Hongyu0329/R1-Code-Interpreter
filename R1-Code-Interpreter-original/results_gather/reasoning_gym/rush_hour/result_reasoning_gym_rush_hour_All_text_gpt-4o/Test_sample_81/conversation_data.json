    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n...E..\n..CE..\nAACE..\n......\n..D...\n..DBBx\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, starting from the first column to the second column.\n\n2. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is located at the fourth column in the third row.\n\n3. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - Car C is horizontally placed in the second row, columns 3 and 4.\n   - Car E is vertically placed in the first and second rows, column 4.\n   - Car D is vertically placed in the fifth and sixth rows, column 3.\n   - Car B is horizontally placed in the sixth row, columns 4 and 5.\n   - Walls are present in the sixth row, column 6.\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - To move the red car (AA) to the exit, we need to clear the path in the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - **Move 1:** Move car C to the right by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n     - Move C: `C+1`\n     - New position of C: second row, columns 4 and 5.\n   - **Move 2:** Move car E up by 1 space to clear the path for C.\n     - Move E: `E-1`\n     - New position of E: first and second rows, column 4.\n   - **Move 3:** Move car C to the right by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n     - Move C: `C+1`\n     - New position of C: second row, columns 5 and 6.\n   - **Move 4:** Move the red car (AA) to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n     - Move AA: `A+2`\n\n### Final Moves:\nCombining all the moves, the sequence to solve the puzzle is:\n```\n<<<C+1 E-1 C+1 A+2>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right."
