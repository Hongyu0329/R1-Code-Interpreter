    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n- The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n- The exit is on the third row, column 6.\n- The red car needs to move right to reach the exit.\n- The path is blocked by the car H, which is vertically oriented in columns 3 and 4, rows 3 and 4.\n- To move the red car, we need to clear the path by moving other cars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move H down**: \n   - Move H down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n   - New position of H: rows 4 and 5, columns 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Move AA right**:\n   - Move AA right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n   - New position of AA: row 3, columns 5 and 6.\n\n### Move Sequence:\n- H+1: Move car H down by 1 space.\n- A+4: Move car AA right by 4 spaces to the exit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<H+1 A+4>>>"
