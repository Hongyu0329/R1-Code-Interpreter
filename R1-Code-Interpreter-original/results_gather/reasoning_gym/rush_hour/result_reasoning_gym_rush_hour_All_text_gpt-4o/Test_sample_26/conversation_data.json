    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\n.BBCCJ\nx....J\nGAAI.K\nGDDI.K\n..HIEE\nFFH...\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Move the red car (AA) to the right until it exits the board.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the position of the red car (AA):**\n   - The red car is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Identify obstacles blocking the red car:**\n   - The car (I) is directly in front of the red car in column 4.\n   - The car (K) is in column 5 and 6, which will also need to be moved eventually.\n\n3. **Plan to clear the path for the red car:**\n   - Move car (I) down to free up space in front of the red car.\n   - Move car (K) to the right to clear the exit path.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **Move car (I) down:**\n   - Move I+1: Move car (I) down by 1 space to free column 4 for the red car.\n\n2. **Move the red car (AA) to the right:**\n   - Move A+1: Move the red car (AA) to the right by 1 space.\n\n3. **Move car (K) to the right:**\n   - Move K+1: Move car (K) to the right by 1 space to clear the exit path.\n\n4. **Move the red car (AA) to the right to exit:**\n   - Move A+2: Move the red car (AA) to the right by 2 spaces to exit the board.\n\n### Final Moves:\n- I+1 A+1 K+1 A+2\n\n**Answer:** <<<I+1 A+1 K+1 A+2>>>"
