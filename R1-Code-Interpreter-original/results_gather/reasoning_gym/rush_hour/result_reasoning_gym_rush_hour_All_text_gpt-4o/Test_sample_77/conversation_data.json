    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a 6x6 grid with various cars and walls. The red car is horizontally oriented, so it can only move left or right. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board and the steps needed:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   x.BBCC\n   DDEELM\n   IJAALM\n   IJFFLN\n   GGK..N\n   ..K.HH\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located on the third row, columns 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit Path:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the third row. The red car needs to move to the right to reach the exit.\n\n4. **Obstacles in the Path:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car L in column 5 and 6 on the third row.\n   - The car L is vertically oriented, so it can only move up or down.\n\n5. **Steps to Clear the Path:**\n   - Move car L down by 1 space to clear the path for the red car.\n   - This will require moving car N down by 1 space to make room for L to move down.\n\n6. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move N down by 1 space: `N+1`\n   - Move L down by 1 space: `L+1`\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 3 spaces to reach the exit: `A+3`\n\n7. **Final Moves:**\n   - `N+1 L+1 A+3`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car can successfully reach the exit.\n\n**Answer: `N+1 L+1 A+3`**"
