    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid with cars represented by letters, and the red car is represented by 'AA'. The exit is located on the right side of the grid, marked by 'E'. We need to move the cars strategically to clear a path for the red car to reach the exit.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - The red car (AA) is horizontally placed in the third row from the top.\n   - The exit is located to the right of the red car.\n\n2. **Immediate Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car 'F' on its right.\n   - The car 'F' is vertically oriented, so it can only move up or down.\n\n3. **Strategy to Clear Path:**\n   - Move car 'F' down to clear the path for the red car.\n   - To move 'F' down, we need to ensure that the space below 'F' is clear.\n\n4. **Steps to Clear Path:**\n   - Move car 'D' down to make space for 'F' to move down.\n   - Move car 'B' down to make space for 'D' to move down.\n   - Move car 'C' down to make space for 'B' to move down.\n\n5. **Execution of Moves:**\n   - Move 'C' down by 1 space: `C+1`\n   - Move 'B' down by 1 space: `B+1`\n   - Move 'D' down by 1 space: `D+1`\n   - Move 'F' down by 1 space: `F+1`\n\n6. **Final Move for Red Car:**\n   - Now that 'F' is moved down, the path is clear for the red car to move to the exit.\n   - Move 'AA' to the right by 2 spaces: `A+2`\n\nBy following these steps, the red car can reach the exit.\n\n**Answer: `C+1 B+1 D+1 F+1 A+2`**"
