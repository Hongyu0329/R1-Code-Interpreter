    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. The board is a grid where each car is represented by a letter, and the red car is represented by 'A'. The goal is to clear a path for the red car to move horizontally to the rightmost column.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Layout:**\n   ```\n   ....BB\n   ...x.F\n   AA.E.F\n   ...E..\n   CCDD..\n   ......\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n\n3. **Identify the Exit:**\n   - The exit is on the right side of the board, specifically at the third row, column 6.\n\n4. **Obstacles in the Path of the Red Car:**\n   - The red car needs to move to the right, but the 'E' car is blocking its path in the third row, column 4.\n\n5. **Plan to Clear the Path:**\n   - We need to move the 'E' car vertically to clear the path for the red car.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move 'E' down by 1 space to clear the path for 'A':\n     - 'E' is currently in the third and fourth rows, column 4. Move it to the fourth and fifth rows, column 4.\n   - Now, the red car (AA) can move to the right.\n\n7. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move 'E' down by 1 space: `E+1`\n   - Move 'A' to the right by 4 spaces to reach the exit: `A+4`\n\n8. **Final Moves:**\n   - Combine the moves: `E+1 A+4`\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully cleared the path for the red car to reach the exit.\n\n**Answer: `E+1 A+4`**"
