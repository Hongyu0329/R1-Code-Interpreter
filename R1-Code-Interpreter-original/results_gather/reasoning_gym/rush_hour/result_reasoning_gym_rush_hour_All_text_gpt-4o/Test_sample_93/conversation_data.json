    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Analysis:\n```\n.BBICC\nxDDI.J\nx.HAAJ\nG.H..K\nGEE..K\n...FFF\n```\n\n- The red car (AA) is horizontally oriented and located in the third row.\n- The exit is on the right side of the third row.\n- We need to clear the path for the red car to move to the exit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear the Path for AA:**\n   - The red car (AA) is blocked by the car J in the third row.\n   - We need to move J down to clear the path for AA.\n\n2. **Move J Down:**\n   - J is vertically oriented and can be moved down.\n   - Move J down by 1 space to clear the path for AA.\n\n3. **Move AA to the Exit:**\n   - Now that the path is clear, move AA to the right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n\n- **Move J Down:** J+1\n  - This moves the J car down by 1 space, clearing the path for AA.\n\n- **Move AA to the Right:** A+2\n  - This moves the red car (AA) to the right by 2 spaces, reaching the exit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\n<<<J+1 A+2>>>\n```"
