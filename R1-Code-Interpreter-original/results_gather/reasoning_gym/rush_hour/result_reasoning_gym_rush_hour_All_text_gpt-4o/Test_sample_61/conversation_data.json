    "To solve the puzzle, we need to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. Let's analyze the board and determine the necessary moves step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Layout:\n```\nBBBCCM\nDDEEEM\nAAJK..\nI.JKFF\nI.GGLx\nHH..L.\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Red Car (AA):**\n   - The red car (AA) is located in the third row, columns 1 and 2.\n   - The goal is to move it to the right until it exits the board.\n\n2. **Identify Obstacles:**\n   - The red car is blocked by the car J (JK) in the third row, columns 3 and 4.\n   - Car J needs to be moved to free the path for the red car.\n\n3. **Move Car J:**\n   - Car J is horizontal and can be moved to the right.\n   - Move J to the right by 2 spaces to free the path for the red car.\n\n4. **Move the Red Car (AA):**\n   - With car J moved, the red car can now move to the right.\n   - Move the red car (AA) to the right by 4 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n### Detailed Moves:\n- **Move J:** Move J to the right by 2 spaces.\n  - Move: `J+2`\n- **Move AA:** Move the red car (AA) to the right by 4 spaces to exit.\n  - Move: `A+4`\n\n### Final Moves:\nCombine the moves into the specified format:\n```\n<<<J+2 A+4>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right. \n\n**Answer:** <<<J+2 A+4>>>"
