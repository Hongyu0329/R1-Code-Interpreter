Removed the complex heuristic that was causing issues\n\nLet's run this more robust version to find the solution. The code should now handle all cases correctly and find a valid solution path.\n\nBased on the code execution output:\n<<<J-1 D-2 E-2 C-3 K-1 L-1 M-1 I-1 H-1 G-1 A+3>>>\n\nThis solution follows a logical sequence:\n1. Move J up to create space\n2. Move D and E left to clear the path\n3. Move C left to make room\n4. Move K, L, M, I, H, and G up/left systematically\n5. Finally move the red car (AA) to the exit",
