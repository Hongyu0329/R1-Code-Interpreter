Identifies blocking vehicles and prioritizes their moves\n2. Uses Manhattan distance heuristic to guide the search\n3. Keeps track of the minimum solution length found\n4.

The solution follows a logical sequence of clearing the path\n3. Each move serves a purpose in eventually freeing the red car\n4. The solution maintains the constraints of the puzzle (no illegal moves)\n\nWe can conclude that this 27-move solution is likely optimal or very close to optimal. The consistency across different search strategies and heuristics suggests that this might be the shortest possible solution for this particular puzzle configuration.\n\nLet's keep this solution:\n<<<E+1 E+1 K-1 B+1 I+1 A+1 F-1 F-1 F-1 A-1 I-1 B-1 D+1 C+1 E+1 A-1 G-1 G-1 G-1 A+1 B-1 J+1 B-1 I+1 A+1 A+1 A+1>>>"
