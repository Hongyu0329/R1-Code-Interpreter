    "I notice that all my previous attempts are producing overly complex solutions. Let's analyze the puzzle more strategically:\n\nLooking at the board:\n```\n.BBICC\nxDDI.J\nx.HAAJ\nG.H..K\nGEE..K\n...FFF\n```\n\nThe key insight is that we need the minimal sequence of moves to:\n1. Move car J up (J-1)\n2. Move car K down (K-1)\n3. Move car H right to make space (H+1)\n4. Move the red car AA to the exit (A+4)\n\nThis is actually the optimal solution I suggested earlier: <<<J-1 K-1 H+1 A+4>>>\n\nLet's verify this sequence:\n1. J-1: Moves car J up one space\n2. K-1: Moves car K down one space\n3. H+1: Moves car H right one space\n4. A+4: Moves car AA four spaces right to the exit\n\nThis is the shortest possible solution because:\n- Cars J and K must be moved to clear the path\n- H must move to allow J and K to move\n- Finally, AA can move to the exit\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the optimal solution is:\n\n<<<J-1 K-1 H+1 A+4>>>"
