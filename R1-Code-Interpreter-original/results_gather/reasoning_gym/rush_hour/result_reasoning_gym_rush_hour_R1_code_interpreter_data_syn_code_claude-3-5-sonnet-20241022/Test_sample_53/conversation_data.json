Implements more aggressive pruning of suboptimal paths\n\nThe optimal solution should be:\n<<<F+1 H-2 B-1 C-1 A+4>>>\n\nThis solution is optimal because:\n1. Move F down (+1) to clear space for A\n2. Move H up (-2) to allow B to move\n3. Move B left (-1) to make room\n4. Move C left (-1) to clear the final path\n5.
