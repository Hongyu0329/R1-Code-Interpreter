    "I see that the code found a different solution than my initial interpretation. Let me analyze the actual solution found by the code:\n\n<<<B-1 G+1 A-1 I-1 E-1 K+1 J+1 C+1 I-1 K+1 D+1 D+1 D+1 I+1 C-1 J-1 H-1 H-1 H-1 H-1 A+1 E-1 E-1 I+1 I+1 A+1 A+1 A+1>>>\n\nThis is indeed a valid solution that gets the red car (AA) to the exit. While it's longer than my previous interpretation, it's a complete solution that the BFS algorithm found. Since BFS finds the shortest path considering all possible moves, this must be the optimal solution given the constraints of the puzzle.\n\nThe solution is correct and achieves the goal of moving the red car (AA) to the exit while respecting all the rules:\n- Only moves vehicles in their allowed directions (horizontal/vertical)\n- Doesn't move through walls\n- Doesn't move through other vehicles\n- Successfully gets the red car to the exit\n\nI'll keep this solution as our final answer:\n<<<B-1 G+1 A-1 I-1 E-1 K+1 J+1 C+1 I-1 K+1 D+1 D+1 D+1 I+1 C-1 J-1 H-1 H-1 H-1 H-1 A+1 E-1 E-1 I+1 I+1 A+1 A+1 A+1>>>"
