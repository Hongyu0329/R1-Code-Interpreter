It:\n1. Represents the board as a list of strings\n2. Tracks vehicle positions and their orientations\n3. Implements move validation and execution\n4. Uses BFS to explore all possible move sequences\n5. Returns the solution when the red car (AA) reaches the exit\n\nThe solution will be printed in the required format.\n\nBased on the code execution output, we can provide the solution:\n\n<<<I-1 G-1 D-2 G-1 F-1 G+3 I+1 A+3>>>\n\nThis sequence of moves:\n1. Moves I up one space\n2. Moves G up one space\n3. Moves D left two spaces\n4. Moves G up one more space\n5. Moves F up one space\n6. Moves G down three spaces\n7. Moves I down one space\n8. Finally moves A (the red car) right three spaces to the exit",
