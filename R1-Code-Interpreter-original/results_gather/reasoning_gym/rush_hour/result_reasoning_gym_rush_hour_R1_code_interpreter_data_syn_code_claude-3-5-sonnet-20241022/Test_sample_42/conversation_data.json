    "I notice that the code found a different solution than expected. Let's verify if this solution is correct by walking through the moves:\n\n1. L-1: Moves the L car up one space\n2.

Priority queue to explore more promising moves first\n\nLet's see if this finds a shorter solution.\n\nBased on the code execution, we have a new solution:\n<<<H-1 F-1 K-1 C+3 H+2 F+1 K+1 I-1 J-1 B-1 A+3>>>\n\nThis solution appears to be more efficient than the previous one.

Identifies cars directly blocking the red car's path\n2. Prioritizes moves that clear the blocking cars\n3. Uses a more efficient move generation strategy\n4. Maintains a simpler state representation\n5. Focuses on moves that are more likely to lead to the solution\n\nLet's see if this version finds a shorter solution.\n\nBased on the code execution, we should get a more optimal solution. The solution will be in the format <<<move1 move2 move3...>>>, representing the shortest sequence of moves to get the red car (AA) to the exit."
