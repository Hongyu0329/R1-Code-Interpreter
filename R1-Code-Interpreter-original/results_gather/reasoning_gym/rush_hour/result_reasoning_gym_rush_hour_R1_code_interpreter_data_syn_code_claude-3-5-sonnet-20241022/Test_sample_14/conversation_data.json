    "I see the actual solution from the code execution is different from what I predicted. Let me verify this solution step by step:\n\n1) G-1: Move car G up one space\n2) F-1: Move car F up one space\n3) H-1: Move car H up one space\n4) D-1: Move car D left one space\n5) D-1: Move car D left another space\n6) J+1: Move car J down one space\n7) C-1: Move car C left one space\n8) K+1: Move car K right one space\n9) K+1: Move car K right another space\n10) A+1: Move the red car (AA) right one space to reach the exit\n\nThis solution is indeed valid and gets the red car to the exit. While my previous analysis suggested a different path, the code found this alternative solution which is also correct. The beauty of using breadth-first search is that it guarantees finding a valid solution with the minimum number of moves.\n\nLet's confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<G-1 F-1 H-1 D-1 D-1 J+1 C-1 K+1 K+1 A+1>>>"
