    "Let me solve this puzzle step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the board:\n- AA is the target red car that needs to reach the exit on the right\n- We need to clear the path for AA to reach the exit\n- The board is 6x6\n- Cars can only move in their orientation (horizontal or vertical)\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this puzzle using a breadth-first search algorithm, as it will find the shortest solution path.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nimport copy\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    return [list(row) for row in board_str.split('\\n') if row]\n\ndef get_car_positions(board):\n    cars = {}\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            car = board[i][j]\n            if car != '.' and car != 'x':\n                if car not in cars:\n                    cars[car] = []\n                cars[car].append((i, j))\n    return cars\n\ndef is_horizontal(positions):\n    return positions[0][0] == positions[1][0]\n\ndef get_possible_moves(board, cars):\n    moves = []\n    for car, positions in cars.items():\n        horizontal = is_horizontal(positions)\n        if horizontal:\n            row = positions[0][0]\n            left = min(p[1] for p in positions)\n            right = max(p[1] for p in positions)\n            # Try moving left\n            if left > 0 and board[row][left-1] == '.':\n                moves.append((car, -1))\n            # Try moving right\n            if right < len(board[0])-1 and board[row][right+1] == '.':\n                moves.append((car, 1))\n        else:\n            col = positions[0][1]\n            top = min(p[0] for p in positions)\n            bottom = max(p[0] for p in positions)\n            # Try moving up\n            if top > 0 and board[top-1][col] == '.':\n                moves.append((car, -1))\n            # Try moving down\n            if bottom < len(board)-1 and board[bottom+1][col] == '.':\n                moves.append((car, 1))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(board, cars, car, direction):\n    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]\n    new_cars = copy.deepcopy(cars)\n    positions = new_cars[car]\n    horizontal = is_horizontal(positions)\n    \n    # Clear current positions\n    for i, j in positions:\n        new_board[i][j] = '.'\n    \n    # Update positions\n    new_positions = []\n    for i, j in positions:\n        if horizontal:\n            new_positions.append((i, j + direction))\n        else:\n            new_positions.append((i + direction, j))\n    \n    # Set new positions\n    for i, j in new_positions:\n        new_board[i][j] = car\n    new_cars[car] = new_positions\n    \n    return new_board, new_cars\n\ndef board_to_string(board):\n    return '\\n'.join(''.join(row) for row in board)\n\ndef solve_puzzle(initial_board_str):\n    board = parse_board(initial_board_str)\n    cars = get_car_positions(board)\n    \n    queue = deque([(board, cars, [])])\n    seen = {board_to_string(board)}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_board, current_cars, moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if red car (AA) has reached the exit\n        red_car_positions = current_cars['A']\n        if max(p[1] for p in red_car_positions) == len(board[0])-1:\n            return moves\n        \n        possible_moves = get_possible_moves(current_board, current_cars)\n        for car, direction in possible_moves:\n            new_board, new_cars = apply_move(current_board, current_cars, car, direction)\n            board_str = board_to_string(new_board)\n            \n            if board_str not in seen:\n                seen.add(board_str)\n                new_moves = moves + [(car, direction)]\n                queue.append((new_board, new_cars, new_moves))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Initial board\nboard = \"\"\"FBB.J.\nF.I.JK\nAAI..K\nCCI..L\nGHDDDL\nGHEEx.\"\"\"\n\nsolution = solve_puzzle(board)\nif solution:\n    # Format the solution\n    formatted_moves = []\n    for car, direction in solution:\n        sign = '+' if direction > 0 else '-'\n        formatted_moves.append(f\"{car}{sign}{abs(direction)}\")\n    print(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(formatted_moves) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis program:\n1) Parses the board into a 2D array\n2) Identifies all cars and their positions\n3) Uses BFS to find the shortest solution path\n4) For each state:\n   - Checks if the red car (AA) has reached the exit\n   - Generates all possible moves\n   - Applies each move to create new states\n   - Keeps track of seen states to avoid cycles\n5) Once a solution is found, formats it according to the required specification\n\nThe code will find the shortest sequence of moves to get the red car to the exit.

    "I see the code execution provided a different solution than my initial answer.

The BFS algorithm found this sequence of moves which, while longer than my initial guess, is a correct solution to the puzzle.
