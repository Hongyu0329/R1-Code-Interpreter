    "I notice that the code found a valid solution, but it might not be the most optimal one. The output shows a sequence of moves that will solve the puzzle, but it's longer than necessary. Let's verify this solution:\n\n1. The solution found moves multiple cars (L, K, H, C, E, F, A, I, G, B, J, D) in a sequence that eventually frees the path for car A.\n2. The solution is valid as it follows the rules:\n   - Cars only move in their allowed directions\n   - No car moves through walls or other cars\n   - The red car (AA) eventually reaches the exit\n\n3. The solution works but is quite long (41 moves). Let's accept this solution as it's valid, even though there might be shorter paths.\n\n<<<L+1 K+1 H+1 C+1 E+1 E+1 C+1 F+1 F+1 A-1 I+1 A-1 G+1 B+1 B+1 B+1 B+1 G-1 I-1 A+1 E-1 E-1 E-1 A+1 F-1 F-1 F-1 A-1 A-1 C-1 C-1 H-1 H-1 D-1 J+1 D-1 D-1 H+1 A+1 A+1 A+1>>>"
