This suggests the presence of another rectangle overlapping with the large one.\n\nLet's count these rectangles. \n\n- The top right rectangle is a single rectangle.\n- The large rectangle is another rectangle.\n- The overlapping section indicates a third rectangle overlapping with the large one.\n\nThus, there are three rectangles in total. \n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = 3 \\]\n\nSo, the output is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
