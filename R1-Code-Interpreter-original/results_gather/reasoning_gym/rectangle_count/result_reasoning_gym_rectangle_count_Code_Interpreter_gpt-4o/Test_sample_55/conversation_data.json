    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. **First Rectangle**: \n   - The large rectangle at the top is outlined by `#` characters. It is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Second Rectangle**:\n   - The rectangle at the bottom left is outlined by `#` characters. It is a single rectangle.\n\n3. **Third Rectangle**:\n   - The rectangle at the bottom right is outlined by `#` characters. It is a single rectangle.\n\n4. **Overlapping Rectangle**:\n   - The overlapping area in the middle is represented by `█` characters. This indicates an overlap of two rectangles.\n\nNow, let's count the rectangles:\n\n- The top rectangle is one.\n- The bottom left rectangle is another.\n- The bottom right rectangle is another.\n- The overlapping area indicates two rectangles overlapping, so we count it as two separate rectangles.\n\nThus, the total count of rectangles is 4.\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n<<<4>>>\n```"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n               ############################################################     \n               #
