How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                               #######                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #             #############\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #      ######\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                ###############################█#####█####         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #######█###█#\n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   ####             #   # \n                #                              #     #   ##
