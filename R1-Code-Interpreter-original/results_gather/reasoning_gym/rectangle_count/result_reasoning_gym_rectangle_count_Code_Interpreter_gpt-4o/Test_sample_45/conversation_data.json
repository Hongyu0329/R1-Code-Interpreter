How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                               #####            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                         ###############       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #####            \n                                         #             #       ##
