There is a large outer rectangle formed by the '#' characters.\n2. Inside this large rectangle, there is a smaller rectangle on the right side, also formed by the '#' characters.\n3. There is an overlapping section on the left side, indicated by the '█' characters, which suggests the presence of another rectangle overlapping with the smaller rectangle.\n\nLet's count these rectangles:\n\n- The large outer rectangle is one.\n- The smaller rectangle on the right is another.\n- The overlapping section suggests a third rectangle overlapping with the smaller one.\n\nThus, there are three rectangles in total.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<3>>>}\n\\]"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                           ########################################             \n                           #
