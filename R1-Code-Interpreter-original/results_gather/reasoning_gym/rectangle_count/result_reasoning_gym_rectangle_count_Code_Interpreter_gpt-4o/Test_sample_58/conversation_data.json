    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the outermost rectangle**: \n   - The outermost rectangle is formed by the '#' characters starting from the top left corner and extending to the bottom right corner. This is the largest rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify overlapping rectangles**:\n   - Inside the outermost rectangle, there is another rectangle formed by the '█' characters. This rectangle overlaps with the outermost rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify any additional rectangles**:\n   - Within the overlapping area, there is a smaller rectangle formed by the '█' characters. This is a distinct rectangle within the overlapping area.\n\nNow, let's count the rectangles:\n\n- Outermost rectangle: 1\n- Overlapping rectangle: 1\n- Smaller rectangle within the overlap: 1\n\nThus, the total number of rectangles is 3.\n\nLet's present the result in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<3>>>\n```"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                       #########################                \n                                       #
