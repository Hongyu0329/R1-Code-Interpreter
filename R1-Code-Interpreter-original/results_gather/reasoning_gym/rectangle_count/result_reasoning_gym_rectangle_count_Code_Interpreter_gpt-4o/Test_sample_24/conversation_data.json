How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                 ###########################                                    \n                 #                         #                                    \n                 #                         #                                    \n                 #                         #                             ####   \n                 #                         #                             #  #   \n                 #                         #   ######################    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 #                         #   #                    #    #  #   \n                 ###########################   #                    #    #  #   \n                                               #                    #    #  #   \n                                ###############█####################█##  #  #   \n                                #              #                    # #  #  #   \n                                #              #                    # #  #  #   \n                                ###############█####################███##█##█#  \n                                               #                    ##
