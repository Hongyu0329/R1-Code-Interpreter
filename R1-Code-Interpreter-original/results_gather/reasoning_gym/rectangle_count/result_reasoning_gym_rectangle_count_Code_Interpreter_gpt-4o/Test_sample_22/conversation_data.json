How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                          ###########################           \n                                          #                         #           \n                                          #                   ######█########   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #             ######█#####█########   \n                                          #             #     #     #      ##
