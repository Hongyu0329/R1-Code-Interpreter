    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. **Outer Rectangle**: There is a large rectangle that encompasses most of the grid, outlined by '#'.\n\n2. **Inner Rectangles**: \n   - There is a smaller rectangle inside the large one, located towards the bottom right.\n   - There is another rectangle overlapping with the smaller one, indicated by the '█' characters.\n\n3. **Overlapping Rectangles**:\n   - The overlapping area is marked by '█', indicating the presence of two overlapping rectangles.\n\nLet's count the rectangles:\n\n- 1 large outer rectangle\n- 1 smaller rectangle inside the large one\n- 1 additional rectangle overlapping with the smaller one\n\nThus, the total number of rectangles is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n```\n<<<3>>>\n```"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                           #############################################        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                               ########    #        \n                           #                               #      #    #        \n                       ####█#####                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          ########    #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n         ##############█###█####█##########################         ####        \n         #             ####█#####                         #         # ##
