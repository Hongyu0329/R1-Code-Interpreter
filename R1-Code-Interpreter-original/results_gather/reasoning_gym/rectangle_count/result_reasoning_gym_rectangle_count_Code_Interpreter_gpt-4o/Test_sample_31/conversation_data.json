How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                         #####################                                  \n           ##############█###################█#################                 \n           #             #                   #                #                 \n           #             #                   #                #                 \n           #             #                   #                #                 \n           #             #                   #                #                 \n           #             #                   #                #                 \n       ####█#############█############       #                #                 \n       #   #             #           #       #                #                 \n       #   #             #           #       #                #                 \n       #   #             #           #       #                #                 \n       #   #             #           #       #                #                 \n       #   ##############█###########█#######█#################                 \n       #                 #           #       #                                  \n       #                 #           #       #                                  \n       #                 #           #       #                                  \n       #                 #           #       #                                  \n       #                 #           #       ###################################\n       #                 #           #       ##
