    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. **First Rectangle**: \n   - The first rectangle is clearly visible at the top of the grid, outlined by '#' characters. It spans horizontally across the grid.\n\n2. **Second Rectangle**:\n   - The second rectangle is located below the first one, starting from the right side of the first rectangle. It is also outlined by '#' characters and extends vertically.\n\n3. **Third Rectangle**:\n   - The third rectangle is located at the bottom right of the grid. It is a smaller rectangle, also outlined by '#' characters.\n\nNow, let's count these rectangles. There are no overlapping rectangles marked by '█', so we only need to count the distinct rectangles outlined by '#'. \n\nThus, the total count of rectangles is 3.\n\nThe output should be formatted as requested:\n\n```\n<<<3>>>\n```"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n  #########################################                                     \n  #
