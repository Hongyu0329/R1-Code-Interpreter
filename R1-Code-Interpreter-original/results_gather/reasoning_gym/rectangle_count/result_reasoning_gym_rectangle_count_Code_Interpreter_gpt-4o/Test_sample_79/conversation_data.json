    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. **Outer Rectangle**: The largest rectangle is formed by the outermost '#' characters, which is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Overlapping Rectangles**: The '█' character indicates overlapping rectangles. We need to identify how many distinct rectangles overlap in these regions.\n\n3. **Inner Rectangles**: There are smaller rectangles within the outer rectangle, some of which overlap with each other.\n\nLet's count the rectangles:\n\n- The outermost rectangle is one.\n- The overlapping region formed by '█' indicates two overlapping rectangles.\n- The smaller rectangle inside the outer rectangle, which does not overlap with others, is another one.\n\nNow, let's count them:\n\n1. The outermost rectangle.\n2. Two overlapping rectangles indicated by '█'.\n3. The smaller rectangle inside the outer rectangle.\n\nThus, the total count of rectangles is 4.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n```\n<<<4>>>\n```"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                     ######################     \n                                                     #                    #     \n                                                     #                    #     \n                                        #############█#####################     \n                                        #            #                   ##
