  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles**: These are enclosed by the '#' character.\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles**: These are indicated by the '█' character, which means two rectangles overlap at that point.\n\nLet's count the rectangles:\n\n1. The first large rectangle starts at the top left corner and extends downwards until it meets the overlapping area.\n2. The second rectangle starts from the overlapping area and extends to the right.\n3. The third rectangle is the one that overlaps with the second rectangle, indicated by the '█' character.\n4. The fourth rectangle is the smaller one at the bottom right corner.\n\nNow, let's count these rectangles programmatically to ensure accuracy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the ASCII grid as a list of strings\nascii_grid = [\n    \"   ###############                                                              \",\n    \"   #
