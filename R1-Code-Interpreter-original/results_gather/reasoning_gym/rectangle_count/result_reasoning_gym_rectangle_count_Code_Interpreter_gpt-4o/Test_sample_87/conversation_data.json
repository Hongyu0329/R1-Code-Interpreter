    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct rectangular shapes formed by the `#` and `█` characters. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. **Vertical Rectangle on the Right:**\n   - A tall rectangle formed by `#` characters, starting from the top and extending downwards.\n\n2. **Overlapping Rectangles in the Middle:**\n   - Two overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` characters. The overlap occurs in the middle section of the grid.\n\n3. **Large Rectangle at the Bottom:**\n   - A large rectangle formed by `#` characters, encompassing a smaller rectangle inside it.\n\nNow, let's count these rectangles:\n\n1. **Vertical Rectangle on the Right:** 1 rectangle\n2. **Overlapping Rectangles in the Middle:** 2 rectangles\n3. **Large Rectangle at the Bottom:** 1 rectangle\n\nAdding these up, we have a total of 4 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n```\n<<<4>>>\n```"
