    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. **Outer Rectangle**: There is a large rectangle that encompasses most of the grid, outlined by '#'.\n\n2. **Inner Rectangle**: Inside the large rectangle, there is a smaller rectangle also outlined by '#'.\n\n3. **Overlapping Rectangle**: There is a third rectangle that overlaps with the inner rectangle, indicated by the '█' character.\n\nSince the '█' character indicates overlapping rectangles, the presence of '█' suggests that there are two rectangles overlapping in that region.\n\nLet's count the rectangles:\n\n- 1 large outer rectangle\n- 1 inner rectangle\n- 1 overlapping rectangle (indicated by '█')\n\nThus, the total number of rectangles is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n```\n<<<3>>>\n```"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                               #############################################    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #          #################                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                   #############          #               #                #    \n                   #          ##
