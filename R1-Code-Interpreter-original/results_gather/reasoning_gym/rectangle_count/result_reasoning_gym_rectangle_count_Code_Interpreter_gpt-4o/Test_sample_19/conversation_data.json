    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangular shapes. Let's break down the grid and count the rectangles.\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles**: These are outlined with `#`.\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles**: These are shown with `█`.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Top Rectangle**: \n   - Starts at row 20, column 65.\n   - Ends at row 31, column 75.\n   - This is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Middle Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at row 32, column 29.\n   - Ends at row 64, column 75.\n   - This is a single rectangle.\n\n3. **Overlapping Area**:\n   - The overlapping area is marked with `█` at row 31, column 75.\n   - This indicates an overlap between the top rectangle and the middle rectangle.\n\n4. **Bottom Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at row 65, column 65.\n   - Ends at row 77, column 75.\n   - This is a single rectangle.\n\n5. **Right Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at row 65, column 77.\n   - Ends at row 77, column 85.\n   - This is a single rectangle.\n\n6. **Overlapping Area**:\n   - The overlapping area is marked with `█` at row 77, column 75.\n   - This indicates an overlap between the bottom rectangle and the right rectangle.\n\nNow, let's count the rectangles:\n\n- Top Rectangle: 1\n- Middle Rectangle: 1\n- Bottom Rectangle: 1\n- Right Rectangle: 1\n\nThe overlapping areas indicate that the top and middle rectangles overlap, and the bottom and right rectangles overlap. However, since the maximum overlap is 2 rectangles, we do not count additional rectangles for overlaps beyond the two already counted.\n\nThus, the total count of rectangles is 4.\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n<<<4>>>\n```"
