  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. **Large Rectangle**: There is a large rectangle that spans most of the grid, outlined by '#' characters. This is the most prominent rectangle.\n\n2. **Overlapping Rectangles**: The '█' character indicates overlapping rectangles. We need to identify these overlaps and count them as separate rectangles.\n\n3. **Smaller Rectangles**: There are smaller rectangles within the large rectangle, especially in the bottom left section of the grid.\n\nLet's count the rectangles:\n\n- The large rectangle is one.\n- The overlapping section with '█' indicates two overlapping rectangles.\n- There are smaller rectangles within the large rectangle.\n\nLet's count these rectangles systematically.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the ASCII grid as a list of strings\nascii_grid = [\n    \"                                                                     ###        \",\n    \"                                                                     #
