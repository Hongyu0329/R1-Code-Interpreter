  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the outermost rectangle**: \n   - The largest rectangle is the one that starts at the top right corner and extends downwards. It is outlined by '#' characters.\n\n2. **Identify overlapping rectangles**:\n   - Inside the largest rectangle, there are smaller rectangles that overlap with each other. These overlaps are represented by '█' characters.\n\n3. **Count distinct rectangles**:\n   - We need to count each distinct rectangle, including those that overlap.\n\nLet's count the rectangles by analyzing the grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the ASCII grid as a list of strings for easier processing\nascii_grid = [\n    \"                                                                ############### \",\n    \"                                                                #             # \",\n    \"                                                                #             # \",\n    \"                                                                #             # \",\n    \"                                                                #             # \",\n    \"                                                                #             # \",\n    \"                                                                #             # \",\n    \"                                                                #             # \",\n    \"                                                          ######█##########   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     #         #   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     #         #   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     #         #   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     #         #   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     #         #   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     #         #   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     #         #   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     #         #   # \",\n    \"                                                          #     ##########█#### \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                          #               #     \",\n    \"                                                  ########█###############█#    \",\n    \"                                                  #       #               ##

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                ############### \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                          ######█##########   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     ##########█#### \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                  ########█###############█#    \n                                                  #       #               ##
