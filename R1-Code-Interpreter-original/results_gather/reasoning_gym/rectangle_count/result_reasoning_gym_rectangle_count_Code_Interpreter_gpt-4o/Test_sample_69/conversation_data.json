    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. **Outer Rectangle**: The largest rectangle is the outermost one, which is clearly visible and formed by the '#' characters.\n\n2. **Inner Rectangles**: Within the outer rectangle, there are several smaller rectangles. We need to identify each distinct rectangle, including those that overlap.\n\n3. **Overlapping Rectangles**: The '█' character indicates overlapping rectangles. We need to account for these overlaps as separate rectangles.\n\nLet's count the rectangles:\n\n- The outermost rectangle is one.\n- There are two smaller rectangles overlapping in the top section.\n- There are two smaller rectangles overlapping in the middle section.\n- There are two smaller rectangles overlapping in the bottom section.\n\nBy analyzing the grid, we can count the total number of distinct rectangles.

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                          ###############################       \n                                          #                             #       \n                                          #                             #       \n                                          #                             #       \n                                          #                             #       \n                                      ####█###########                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #              ####█###    \n                                      #   #          #              #   #  #    \n                                      #   #          #              #   #  #    \n      ################################█###█##########█##############█###█  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   ###########█##############█###█  #    \n      #                               #              #              #   #  #    \n      #                 ##############█##############█#######       #   #  #    \n      #                 #             #              #      #       #   #  #    \n      #                 #             #              #      #       #   #  #    \n      #                 #         ####█##############█######█#      #   #  #    \n      #                 #         #   #              #      ##
