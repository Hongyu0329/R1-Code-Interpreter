    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters.

This rectangle is entirely within the larger rectangle.\n\n3. **Rectangle at the Bottom Left**:\n   - A separate rectangle is located at the bottom left of the grid, outlined with '#'.\n\n4. **Rectangle at the Bottom Right**:\n   - Another rectangle is located at the bottom right, overlapping with the bottom left rectangle, indicated by the '█' characters.\n\nNow, let's count these rectangles:\n\n- 1 large rectangle at the top\n- 1 overlapping rectangle in the middle\n- 1 rectangle at the bottom left\n- 1 overlapping rectangle at the bottom right\n\nThus, the total count of rectangles is 4.\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n<<<4>>>\n```"
