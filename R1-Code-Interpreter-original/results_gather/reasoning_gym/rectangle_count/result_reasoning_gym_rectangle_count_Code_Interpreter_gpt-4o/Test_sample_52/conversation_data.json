Let's break down the grid:\n\n1. **Outer Rectangle**: The entire grid is enclosed by a large rectangle formed by the '#' characters.\n\n2. **Overlapping Rectangles**: \n   - There are two overlapping rectangles in the lower right section of the grid, indicated by the '█' characters. \n   - The overlapping area is shared by these two rectangles.\n\n3. **Additional Rectangles**:\n   - There is another rectangle in the lower right corner, which is not overlapping with any other rectangle.\n\nLet's count these rectangles:\n\n- 1 large outer rectangle\n- 2 overlapping rectangles\n- 1 additional rectangle in the lower right corner\n\nThus, the total number of rectangles is 4.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n```\n<<<4>>>\n```"
