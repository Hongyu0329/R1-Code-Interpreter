    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct rectangular shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - The first rectangle is the large one on the left, outlined by '#' characters.\n   - The second rectangle is the one on the right, also outlined by '#' characters.\n   - The third rectangle is the small one at the bottom right, outlined by '#' characters.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The overlapping area is represented by '█' characters. This indicates that there are two overlapping rectangles in this region.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified three distinct rectangles and one overlapping area, which accounts for two additional rectangles.\n\nLet's count the total number of rectangles:\n\n- 3 single rectangles\n- 2 overlapping rectangles\n\nThus, the total count of rectangles is 5.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n```\n<<<5>>>\n```"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n   ################                                                             \n   #              #                                                             \n   #              #                                                             \n   #              #                                                             \n   #              #                                                             \n   #              #                              ###############                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #         #####  \n   #              #                              #             #         #   #  \n   #              #                              #             #         #   #  \n   ################                              #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #           ##█         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █ #########   #  \n                                                 #           # █ #      ##
