  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "\nassistant > To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to identify distinct closed shapes formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Each rectangle is defined by a continuous boundary of these characters.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles**: These are outlined with '#'.\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles**: These are shown with '█', indicating the overlap of two rectangles.\n\nWe'll count each distinct rectangle, including those that overlap.

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                       #############                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                     ##█###########█########################################### \n                     # #           #                                          # \n                     # #           #                                          # \n                     ##█###########█########################################### \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #   #########################                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #   #############       #                \n                       #           #   #   #           #       #                \n                       #           #   #   #           #       #                \n                      #█#####      #   #   #           #       #                \n                      ##
