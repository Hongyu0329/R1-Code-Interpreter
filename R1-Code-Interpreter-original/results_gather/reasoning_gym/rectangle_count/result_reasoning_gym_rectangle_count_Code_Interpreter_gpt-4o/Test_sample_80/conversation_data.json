  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n  ###########                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                          ############################             \n  #         #                          #                          #             \n  #         #                          #                          #             \n  #         #                          ############################             \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                    #########################                      \n  #         #                    #                       #                      \n  #         #                    #                       #                      \n  #         #                    #                       #                      \n  #         #       #############█############           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  ###########       #            #           #           #                      \n                    #            #           #           #                      \n                    #            ############█############                      \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #            ###                   \n                    #                        #            # #                   \n                    #                       #█############█#█############       \n                    #                       ##
