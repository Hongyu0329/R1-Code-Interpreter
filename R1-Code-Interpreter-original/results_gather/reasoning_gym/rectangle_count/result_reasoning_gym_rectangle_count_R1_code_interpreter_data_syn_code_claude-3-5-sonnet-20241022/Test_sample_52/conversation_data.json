  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

Converts the input grid into a 2D array\n2. For each possible combination of top-left and bottom-right coordinates:\n   - Checks if these coordinates form a valid rectangle by verifying:\n     * All corners are marked with '#' or '█'\n     * All edges are continuous and marked with '#' or '█'\n     * Interior only contains spaces or valid markers\n3. Counts all valid rectangles found\n\nThis should correctly count:\n1. The large outer rectangle\n2. The rectangle in the bottom right corner\n3. The small rectangle at the very bottom\n4. The rectangle in the middle right\n5. The rectangle in the middle\n6. The rectangle that overlaps with the middle rectangle\n7. The rectangle that extends from the middle to the bottom\n\n<<<7>>>",

Looks for top-left corners of rectangles\n2. For each potential corner, traces the rectangle by following the edges\n3. Verifies that the rectangle is valid by checking:\n   - All corners and edges are properly marked\n   - No other rectangles are touching the edges\n   - The rectangle is complete\n\nLet's count the rectangles:\n1. The large outer rectangle\n2. The rectangle in the bottom right corner\n3. The small rectangle at the very bottom\n4. The rectangle in the middle right\n5. The rectangle in the middle\n6. The rectangle that overlaps with the middle rectangle\n7. The rectangle that extends from the middle to the bottom\n\n<<<7>>>",

Finds all points that could be corners (marked with # or █)\n2. For each pair of potential corners that could form a rectangle (one being top-left, other being bottom-right):\n   - Checks if the other two corners exist\n   - Verifies that all edges are properly marked\n   - Ensures it's a minimal rectangle (no other corners inside)\n3. Counts unique rectangles\n\nThe rectangles in the grid are:\n1. The large outer rectangle\n2. The small rectangle at the very bottom\n3. The rectangle in the bottom right corner\n4. The rectangle in the middle right\n5. The rectangle in the middle\n6. The rectangle that overlaps with the middle rectangle\n7. The rectangle that extends from the middle to the bottom\n\n<<<7>>>",

Only looks for valid top-left corners (no edge character above or to the left)\n2. From each valid top-left corner, traces the rectangle by:\n   - Following the top edge to find the right boundary\n   - Following the left edge to find the bottom boundary\n   - Verifying the bottom-right corner exists\n   - Checking that all edges are complete\n3. Adds valid rectangles to a set to avoid duplicates\n4. Added debug printing to show the coordinates of each rectangle found\n\nLet's verify the rectangles:\n1. The large outer rectangle\n2. The small rectangle at the very bottom\n3. The rectangle in the bottom right corner\n4. The rectangle in the middle right\n5. The rectangle in the middle\n6. The rectangle that overlaps with the middle rectangle\n7. The rectangle that extends from the middle to the bottom\n\n<<<7>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.
