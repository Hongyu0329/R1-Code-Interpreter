  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                          ###   \n                                                                          #

    "Let me help solve this rectangle counting problem. I'll write a Python script to analyze the ASCII grid and count the rectangles.\n\nThinking process:\n1. First, we need to identify all rectangles in the grid, including:\n   - Single rectangles marked with '#'\n   - Overlapping rectangles marked with '█'\n2. For overlapping rectangles (marked with '█'), we need to count them as two separate rectangles\n3. We'll need to:\n   - Parse the grid into a 2D array\n   - Identify rectangle corners and edges\n   - Count complete rectangles\n   - Handle overlapping cases\n\nHere's a Python script to solve this:\n\n```python\ndef find_rectangles(grid):\n    height = len(grid)\n    width = len(grid[0])\n    rectangles = 0\n    \n    # Helper function to check if a point is part of rectangle border\n    def is_border(char):\n        return char in ['#', '█']\n    \n    # Helper function to validate rectangle\n    def validate_rectangle(top, left, bottom, right):\n        # Check top and bottom edges\n        for x in range(left, right + 1):\n            if not is_border(grid[top][x]) or not is_border(grid[bottom][x]):\n                return False\n        # Check left and right edges\n        for y in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            if not is_border(grid[y][left]) or not is_border(grid[y][right]):\n                return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Find all possible rectangles\n    for top in range(height):\n        for left in range(width):\n            if is_border(grid[top][left]):\n                # Find possible bottom and right coordinates\n                for bottom in range(top, height):\n                    for right in range(left, width):\n                        if (is_border(grid[top][left]) and \n                            is_border(grid[top][right]) and \n                            is_border(grid[bottom][left]) and \n                            is_border(grid[bottom][right])):\n                            \n                            if validate_rectangle(top, left, bottom, right):\n                                # Count overlapping sections\n                                overlap_count = 0\n                                for y in range(top, bottom + 1):\n                                    for x in range(left, right + 1):\n                                        if grid[y][x] == '█':\n                                            overlap_count += 1\n                                \n                                # Add base rectangle\n                                if overlap_count > 0:\n                                    rectangles += 2  # Overlapping means 2 rectangles\n                                else:\n                                    rectangles += 1\n\n    # Adjust for double counting of overlapping rectangles\n    return rectangles // 2\n\n# Parse the input grid\ngrid = []\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        line = input()\n        grid.append(list(line))\n    except EOFError:\n        break\n\n# Count rectangles\nresult = find_rectangles(grid)\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis script:\n1. Reads the ASCII grid input\n2. Implements a rectangle finding algorithm that:\n   - Looks for all possible rectangle corners\n   - Validates complete rectangles by checking their borders\n   - Handles overlapping cases (marked with '█')\n   - Adjusts for double counting of rectangles\n3.

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                          ###   \n                                                                          #
