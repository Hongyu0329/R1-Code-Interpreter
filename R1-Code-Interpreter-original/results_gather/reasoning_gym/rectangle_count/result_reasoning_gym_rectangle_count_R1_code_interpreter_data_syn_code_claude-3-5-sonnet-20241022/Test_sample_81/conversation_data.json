  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with 'â–ˆ'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

This rectangle is located in the middle of the grid and has the following characteristics:\n   - Width: 4 characters (####)\n   - Height: 14 lines\n   - Formed by '#' characters making the outline\n   - The interior is filled with spaces (except for the borders)\n\nThe code correctly detected this rectangle by:\n1. Scanning the grid for potential top-left corners of rectangles\n2. When finding a '#', checking if it forms a complete rectangle by verifying:\n   - The horizontal edges (top and bottom)\n   - The vertical edges (left and right)\n   - The corners\n3. Counting each valid rectangle exactly once by only counting from its top-left corner\n\nSince there are no overlapping rectangles (which would be marked with 'â–ˆ') and only one clear rectangle formed by '#' characters, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
