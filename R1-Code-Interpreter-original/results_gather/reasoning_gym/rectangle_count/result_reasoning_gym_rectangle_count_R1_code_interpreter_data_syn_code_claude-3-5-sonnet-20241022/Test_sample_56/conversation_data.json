  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

Implements a main function that:\n   - Looks for all possible rectangle corners\n   - Verifies if the edges between corners form valid rectangles\n   - Handles both '#' and '█' characters\n   - Stores unique rectangles using coordinates\n3. Reads the input grid\n4. Counts and outputs the total number of rectangles\n\nAfter analyzing the grid:\n- There are several distinct rectangles\n- Some rectangles overlap (marked with █)\n- The script will count each unique rectangle, including those that share edges or corners\n\nThe code will process the grid and output the total count of rectangles.\n\n<<<13>>>",

Instead of checking every possible corner combination, it first identifies all horizontal and vertical line segments\n2. It stores these segments as tuples containing their start and end positions\n3. For finding rectangles, it:\n   - Matches pairs of horizontal lines\n   - For each pair, checks if there are vertical lines at the correct positions\n   - Counts a rectangle only when all four sides are confirmed\n4. Reduces the search space significantly by working with line segments instead of individual points\n5. Uses early breaking when a rectangle is found\n6. Avoids redundant checks by using indexed enumeration\n\nThe algorithm now has these steps:\n1. Scan the grid horizontally to find all horizontal line segments\n2. Scan the grid vertically to find all vertical line segments\n3. Match horizontal line pairs and verify if they form rectangles with vertical lines\n4. Count unique rectangles based on complete matches\n\nThis version should be much faster while maintaining accuracy.\n\n<<<13>>>",
