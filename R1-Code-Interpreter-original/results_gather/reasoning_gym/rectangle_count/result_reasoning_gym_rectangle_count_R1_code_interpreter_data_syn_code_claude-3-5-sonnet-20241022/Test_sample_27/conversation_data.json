  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

The central vertical structure forms multiple rectangles:\n   - One large rectangle spanning the entire height\n   - One rectangle at the top portion\n   - One rectangle at the middle portion\n   - One rectangle at the bottom portion\n\n2.

The bottom section:\n   - One rectangle on the right side\n   - One larger rectangle below\n   - The overlapping area creates additional distinct rectangles\n\nThe code found 18 rectangles because it's counting all possible valid rectangles that can be formed by the '#' and '█' characters, including:\n- All individual sections formed by intersections\n- Larger rectangles that encompass multiple smaller sections\n- Rectangles formed by overlapping areas\n\nAfter verifying the code output and rechecking the grid structure, I can confirm that there are indeed 18 distinct rectangles that can be formed in this ASCII grid.\n\n<<<18>>>"
