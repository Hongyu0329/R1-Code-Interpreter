  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "I apologize for my previous answers. Let me carefully recount the rectangles in the grid:\n\n1. One large rectangle at the top\n2. One long horizontal rectangle in the middle\n3. One tall vertical rectangle on the right side that spans most of the height\n4. Two overlapping rectangles in the middle (marked with █)\n5. One rectangle at the bottom middle\n6. One small rectangle in the middle (the one that overlaps with the vertical rectangle)\n\nNow I can see that I missed counting the small rectangle that creates the overlap. When two rectangles overlap (marked with █), we should count both rectangles individually.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>\n\nThe previous confusion came from not properly counting the overlapping rectangles as separate entities. Each █ section indicates where two distinct rectangles intersect, and we need to count both rectangles involved in the overlap."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                   ############ \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   ############ \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                      ######### \n                                                                      #       # \n      ####################################################            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      ####################################################            #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                              ########################█###    # \n                                              #                       #  #    # \n                                              ########################█###    # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                  #####################       # \n                                                  #                  ##
