  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

The tall vertical rectangle in the middle (top portion)\n2. The large horizontal rectangle at the bottom\n3. The small rectangle in the middle that overlaps with the large one\n4. The rectangle on the right side that overlaps with the large one\n5. The small rectangle in the bottom right corner\n6. The rectangle formed by the overlapping section in the middle bottom\n7. The rectangle formed by the overlapping section in the bottom right\n\nEach of these rectangles is distinct and can be clearly identified in the grid. The overlapping sections (marked with █) indicate where two rectangles intersect.\n\n<<<7>>>",
