  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

The code identifies complete rectangles by finding top-left corners and tracing the edges\n2. It counts overlapping regions (marked by '█') and adds them to the total count\n3. Each '█' character represents an overlap of two rectangles, so we add one extra rectangle for each overlap\n\n<<<9>>>",

    "Let me verify my analysis one more time to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's count the rectangles systematically:\n\nBase Rectangles (non-overlapping parts):\n1. Large rectangle on the left side (the main container)\n2. Rectangle in the middle-top\n3. Rectangle in the middle\n4. Rectangle on the right side\n5. Small rectangle on the bottom-right corner (the thin vertical one)\n6. Rectangle in the middle-bottom (the wide one)\n7. Small rectangle on the left-bottom\n\nOverlapping Regions (marked with █):\n- Looking at the ASCII art, there are 9 '█' characters\n- Each '█' represents an intersection of two rectangles\n- Therefore, we need to add 9 to our base count of 7 rectangles\n\nTotal calculation:\n- Base rectangles: 7\n- Additional rectangles from overlaps: 9\n- Total: 7 + 9 = 16\n\nThe code output of 16 matches with our manual analysis. Therefore, I can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<16>>>"
