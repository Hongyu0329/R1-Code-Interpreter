  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

Proper handling of both '#' and '█' characters\n2. More efficient searching by looking for top-left corners first\n3. Better validation of rectangle boundaries\n4. Proper checking of interior spaces\n\nLooking at the grid, there is exactly one rectangle formed by '#' characters. It's a complete rectangle with no gaps or overlaps.\n\n<<<1>>>",
    "Great! The code is now working correctly. Let me explain why the answer is 1:\n\n1. In the given ASCII grid, there is exactly one rectangle present:\n   - It's formed by '#' characters\n   - Located in the middle-bottom portion of the grid\n   - Has dimensions of approximately 12x14 characters\n   - Has a complete border with no gaps\n   - Has empty space inside\n   - Has no overlapping rectangles (no '█' characters present)\n\n2. The code successfully identified this rectangle by:\n   - Finding the top-left corner\n   - Verifying the complete border\n   - Checking that the interior contains only spaces\n   - Confirming all four corners are present\n   - Ensuring continuous lines for all sides\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<1>>>"
