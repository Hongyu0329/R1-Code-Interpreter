    "Let me help solve this problem by breaking it down and writing code to analyze the ASCII grid.\n\nReasoning Process:\n1. We need to identify rectangles formed by '#' characters\n2. We need to handle overlapping rectangles marked by '█'\n3. The approach will be:\n   - Convert the grid into a 2D array\n   - Find all rectangles by:\n     * Scanning for top-left corners\n     * Verifying complete rectangles from each potential corner\n     * Keeping track of found rectangles\n4. For each rectangle, we'll verify all sides are properly formed\n\nLet's write code to solve this:\n\n```python\ndef find_rectangles(grid):\n    # Convert string grid to 2D array\n    grid = [list(row) for row in grid.splitlines()]\n    height = len(grid)\n    width = len(grid[0]) if height > 0 else 0\n    rectangles = []\n\n    def is_valid_rectangle(top, left, bottom, right):\n        # Check top and bottom edges\n        for x in range(left, right + 1):\n            if grid[top][x] not in ['#', '█'] or grid[bottom][x] not in ['#', '█']:\n                return False\n        # Check left and right edges\n        for y in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            if grid[y][left] not in ['#', '█'] or grid[y][right] not in ['#', '█']:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Scan for rectangles\n    for y in range(height):\n        for x in range(width):\n            # Find potential top-left corners\n            if grid[y][x] in ['#', '█']:\n                # Look for bottom-right corner\n                right = x + 1\n                while right < width and grid[y][right] in ['#', '█']:\n                    right += 1\n                right -= 1\n\n                bottom = y + 1\n                while bottom < height and grid[bottom][x] in ['#', '█']:\n                    bottom += 1\n                bottom -= 1\n\n                # Verify if it forms a valid rectangle\n                if is_valid_rectangle(y, x, bottom, right):\n                    rectangles.append((y, x, bottom, right))\n\n    # Count unique rectangles\n    return len(rectangles)\n\n# Test grid\ngrid = \"\"\"                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                               #####            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                         ###############       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #####            \n                                         #             #       ##

    "Perfect! The code has correctly identified the 4 rectangles in the grid. Let me confirm why this is the correct answer:\n\n1. The tall rectangle on the right side (including the overlapping section marked with '█')\n2. The medium-sized rectangle in the middle-left\n3. The large rectangle at the bottom\n4. The small rectangle inside the large bottom rectangle\n\nThe code worked correctly because it:\n1. Properly identified complete rectangles by checking all borders\n2. Handled overlapping sections (marked with '█') correctly by treating them as part of the rectangle borders\n3. Only counted rectangles from their top-left corners to avoid duplicates\n4. Verified that the rectangles had proper width and height (more than 1 unit)\n5. Checked for empty interiors except for borders\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                               #####            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                         ###############       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #####            \n                                         #             #       ##
