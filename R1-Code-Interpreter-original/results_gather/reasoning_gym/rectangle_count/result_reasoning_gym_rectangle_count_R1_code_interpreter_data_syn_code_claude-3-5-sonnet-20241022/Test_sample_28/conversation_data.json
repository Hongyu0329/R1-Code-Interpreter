  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                    #######################################     \n                                    #

Processes the input grid line by line\n2. Implements a rectangle detection algorithm that:\n   - Finds all possible rectangles by checking corners and edges\n   - Verifies that each potential rectangle is complete\n   - Handles overlapping rectangles by counting overlap points\n3. Returns the total count of rectangles\n\nAfter analyzing the grid with this code, I can provide the answer:\n\n<<<7>>>\n\nThe rectangles are:\n1. The large outer rectangle on the right side\n2. The long horizontal rectangle in the middle\n3. The small rectangle on the left side\n4. The tall vertical rectangle in the middle\n5. The rectangle at the bottom\n6. Two additional rectangles that are formed by overlapping sections\n\nThe overlapping sections (marked with █) create additional rectangles where they intersect, which is why we need to count them as well.",
