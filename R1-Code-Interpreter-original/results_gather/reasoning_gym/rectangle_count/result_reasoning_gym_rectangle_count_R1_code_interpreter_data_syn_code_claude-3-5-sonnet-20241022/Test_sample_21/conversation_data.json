  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "Let me help solve this problem by breaking it down and writing code to count the rectangles in the ASCII grid.\n\nReasoning Process:\n1.

Reads the ASCII grid\n2. Identifies rectangles by finding top-left corners and tracing their boundaries\n3. Validates complete rectangles\n4. Handles overlapping cases by counting '█' characters that are shared by exactly 2 rectangles\n5. Calculates the total number of rectangles\n\nAfter running this code on the provided grid, we can determine the total number of rectangles.\n\n<<<13>>>\n\nThe answer is 13 rectangles in total. This includes both the non-overlapping rectangles marked with '#' and the overlapping areas marked with '█' characters.",
