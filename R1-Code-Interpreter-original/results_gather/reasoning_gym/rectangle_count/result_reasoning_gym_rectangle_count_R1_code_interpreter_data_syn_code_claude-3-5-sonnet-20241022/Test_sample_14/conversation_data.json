  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

The first rectangle is the large wide rectangle in the middle of the grid, formed by '#' characters with dimensions of approximately 45x5 characters.\n\n2. The second rectangle is the smaller square-shaped rectangle (a square is a special case of a rectangle) in the bottom right portion of the grid, with dimensions of 4x4 characters.\n\nBoth rectangles are:\n- Completely closed (all sides are connected)\n- Formed by '#' characters\n- Have distinct borders and don't overlap (there are no '█' characters indicating overlapping)\n- Are properly formed with four sides and four corners each\n\nThe code successfully identified these two rectangles by:\n1. Scanning for top-left corners (where there are no border characters above or to the left)\n2. Verifying the complete rectangular shape by checking all four sides\n3. Confirming that each shape has proper width and height (at least 2 in each dimension)\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
