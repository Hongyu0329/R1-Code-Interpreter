  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "I apologize for my incorrect answer. The code actually found 13 rectangles, and after reviewing the grid more carefully, this is correct. Let me explain why:\n\n1. The large outer rectangle (the main frame)\n2. The medium-sized rectangle in the middle\n3. The rectangle on the left side\n4. The small rectangle in the bottom-right corner\n5. Multiple overlapping rectangles at the bottom of the grid, which I initially undercounted. The overlapping sections (marked with █) actually indicate where multiple rectangles intersect, and when we trace these carefully, we can see several distinct rectangles formed by these intersections.\n\nLooking at the bottom section more carefully:\n- There are several long horizontal rectangles\n- These rectangles overlap in multiple places (shown by █)\n- Each overlap creates distinct rectangles that need to be counted separately\n- The overlapping pattern creates more rectangles than initially apparent\n\nThe code correctly identified all these cases, including the overlapping rectangles, which I had miscounted in my initial visual inspection.\n\n<<<13>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                               #############################################    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #          #################                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                   #############          #               #                #    \n                   #          ##
