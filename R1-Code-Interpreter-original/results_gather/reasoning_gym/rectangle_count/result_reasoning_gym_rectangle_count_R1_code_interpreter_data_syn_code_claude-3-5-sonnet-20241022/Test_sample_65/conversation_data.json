Let me analyze why:\n\nLooking at the grid again more carefully:\n1. Large rectangle on the left\n2. Small rectangle on the top right\n3. Medium rectangle in the middle\n4. Tall rectangle on the right\n5. The overlapping areas (█) create additional rectangles:\n   - The overlapping area between the large left rectangle and middle rectangle creates two additional rectangles\n   - The overlapping area marked by '████' creates multiple additional rectangles\n   - Each overlapping section effectively splits the rectangles into additional valid rectangles\n\nAfter this more detailed analysis, I can confirm that the code output of 9 rectangles is correct. Here's why:\n1. Main large rectangle on the left\n2. Small rectangle on top right\n3. Middle rectangle\n4. Tall rectangle on right\n5. Two rectangles formed by the first █ overlap area\n6. Three additional rectangles formed by the '████' overlap area\n\nTherefore:\n\n<<<9>>>"
