  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

Makes minimal necessary checks to confirm a rectangle exists\n5. Avoids expensive edge verification\n6. Skips empty lines to reduce processing\n\nLooking at the ASCII grid:\n1.
