  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "Let me help solve this problem by breaking it down into steps and writing code to count the rectangles.\n\nReasoning Process:\n1. We need to identify individual rectangles in the ASCII grid\n2.

Defines helper functions to identify corners and complete rectangles\n2. Scans the grid for potential rectangle corners\n3. For each corner found, verifies if it's part of a valid rectangle\n4. Stores unique rectangles using their coordinates and dimensions\n5. Returns the total count\n\nAfter running the code with the provided grid, we can determine the total number of rectangles.\n\n<<<11>>>\n\nThe answer is 11 rectangles in total. This includes:\n- The large outer rectangles\n- The smaller rectangles inside\n- The rectangles formed by overlapping sections (marked with █)\nEach rectangle is counted only once, even if parts of it are marked with █ due to overlap.",
