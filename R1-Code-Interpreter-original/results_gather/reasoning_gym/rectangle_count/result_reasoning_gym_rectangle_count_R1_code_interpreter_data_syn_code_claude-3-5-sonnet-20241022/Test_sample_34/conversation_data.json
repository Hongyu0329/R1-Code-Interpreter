  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "The code executed successfully and confirmed my analysis. Let me explain why the answer is 2:\n\n1. The first rectangle is the large one in the middle of the grid:\n   - It's approximately 30 characters wide and 30 characters tall\n   - It's made up of '#' characters forming a complete rectangle outline\n\n2. The second rectangle is the smaller one near the bottom:\n   - It's approximately 19 characters wide and 3 characters tall\n   - It's also made up of '#' characters forming a complete rectangle outline\n\nThe code correctly:\n1. Identified all '#' characters in the grid\n2. Found valid rectangles by checking for:\n   - Complete horizontal and vertical lines\n   - Connected corners\n   - Proper rectangle shapes\n3. Counted the total number of unique rectangles\n\nSince there are no overlapping rectangles (which would be indicated by '█' characters) and exactly two distinct rectangular shapes, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                       ##############################           \n                                       #
