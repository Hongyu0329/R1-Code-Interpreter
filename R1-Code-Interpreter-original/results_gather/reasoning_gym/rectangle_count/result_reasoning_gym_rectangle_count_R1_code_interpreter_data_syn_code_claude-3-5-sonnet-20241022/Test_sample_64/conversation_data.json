  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "Let me help solve this problem by breaking it down and writing code to analyze the ASCII grid.\n\nReasoning Process:\n1. First, we need to identify what constitutes a rectangle in this ASCII art:\n   - Rectangles are outlined with '#' characters\n   - Overlapping areas are marked with '█'\n   - Each rectangle should have four corners and connected edges\n\n2. Strategy to count rectangles:\n   - Parse the grid into a 2D array\n   - Look for complete rectangles by:\n     * Finding all possible corner points\n     * For each pair of diagonal corners, verify if they form a valid rectangle\n     * Handle overlapping rectangles marked by '█'\n\n3.

The large outer rectangle\n2. The small rectangle in the upper right\n3. The horizontal rectangle in the middle\n4. The rectangle in the middle-right\n5. The rectangle in the bottom-right\n6. The vertical rectangle on the left side\n7. The central vertical rectangle that overlaps with others",
    "I apologize for the discrepancy. The code is counting more rectangles than intended because it's also counting some sub-rectangles and combinations that we shouldn't consider. Let me revise the approach.\n\nLet's modify our strategy:\n1. We should only count the \"minimal\" complete rectangles (those that aren't subdivided)\n2. We need to be more selective about what constitutes a valid rectangle\n3. We should handle overlapping areas ('█') more carefully\n\nHere's the improved code:\n\n```python\ndef is_minimal_rectangle(grid, top, left, bottom, right):\n    # Check if this is a minimal rectangle (no subdivisions inside)\n    \n    #
