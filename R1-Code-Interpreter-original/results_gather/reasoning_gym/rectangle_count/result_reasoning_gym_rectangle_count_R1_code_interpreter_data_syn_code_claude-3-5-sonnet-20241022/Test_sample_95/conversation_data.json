  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

Converting the input string into a grid\n2. Scanning for potential rectangle corners\n3. When a potential corner is found, it verifies if it forms a complete rectangle by checking all borders\n4. Counts each valid rectangle found\n\nLooking at the output and confirming with visual inspection:\n- There is exactly one rectangle in the grid\n- It's a 3x6 rectangle made with '#' characters\n- There are no overlapping rectangles (no '█' characters)\n\n<<<1>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me explain why the answer is 1:\n\n1. The grid contains a single rectangle with the following characteristics:\n   - Width: 3 characters (from left to right)\n   - Height: 6 characters (from top to bottom)\n   - Made entirely of '#' characters\n   - Located on the right side of the grid\n   - Forms a complete rectangle with:\n     * Horizontal borders at top and bottom (###)\n     * Vertical borders on sides (# #)\n\n2. The rectangle is clearly defined and isolated:\n   - No overlapping with other rectangles (no '█' characters present)\n   - No other rectangles present in the grid\n   - All borders are properly connected\n\n3. The code correctly identified this single rectangle by:\n   - Finding the top-left corner\n   - Verifying the complete rectangular shape\n   - Checking all border characters\n   - Confirming it's a valid rectangle structure\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
