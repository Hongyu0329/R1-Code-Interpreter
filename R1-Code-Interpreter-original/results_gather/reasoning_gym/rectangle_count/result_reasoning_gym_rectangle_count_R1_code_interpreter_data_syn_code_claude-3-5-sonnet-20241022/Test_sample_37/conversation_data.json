  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "Great! The code worked correctly this time. Let me explain why the answer is 1:\n\n1. In the given ASCII grid, there is exactly one rectangle that is:\n   - Made up of '#' characters\n   - Has a complete border (top, bottom, left, and right sides)\n   - Is 24 characters wide (including the corners)\n   - Is 47 characters tall (including the corners)\n   - Has empty space inside\n   - Located roughly in the middle-left portion of the grid\n\n2. The code successfully:\n   - Found the top-left corner of the rectangle\n   - Verified all four sides were complete\n   - Confirmed it was a valid rectangle\n   - Counted it exactly once\n\n3. There are:\n   - No overlapping rectangles (no '█' characters)\n   - No other rectangles in the grid\n   - Just empty space around the single rectangle\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<1>>>"
