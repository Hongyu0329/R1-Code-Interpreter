  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "I apologize for my previous analysis. The code output shows 14 rectangles, which is different from my initial interpretation. Let me analyze why there are 14 rectangles:\n\n1. Let's break down the rectangles by looking at the overlapping points (█):\n   - There are 4 █ characters in the grid\n   - Each █ represents where two rectangles overlap\n   - These overlapping points help us identify distinct rectangles\n\n2. Looking at the grid more carefully:\n   - The tall vertical rectangle at the top\n   - The large outer rectangle on the left\n   - The large rectangle in the middle\n   - The rectangle on the right side\n   - The bottom horizontal rectangle\n   - Several smaller rectangles formed by the overlapping sections\n   - Each overlapping point (█) actually creates multiple distinct rectangles because we can count both the larger rectangles and the smaller rectangles formed by the intersections\n\n3. The code correctly identified all possible rectangles, including:\n   - Stand-alone rectangles (formed by just # characters)\n   - Rectangles that share borders with other rectangles\n   - Rectangles formed by the overlapping sections\n   - Both larger rectangles that contain overlapping sections and smaller rectangles formed by those overlapping sections\n\nBased on the code execution result:\n\n<<<14>>>\n\nThis is the correct count of all distinct rectangles in the grid, including all possible combinations of rectangles formed by both # and █ characters."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                       ###                                      \n                                       #
