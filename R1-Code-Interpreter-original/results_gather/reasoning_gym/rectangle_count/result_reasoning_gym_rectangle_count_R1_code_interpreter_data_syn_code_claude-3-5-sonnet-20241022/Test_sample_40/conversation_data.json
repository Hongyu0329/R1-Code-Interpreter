The large main rectangle\n2. The medium rectangle on the right side\n3. Two small overlapping rectangles (indicated by the '█' characters)",
    "I apologize for my initial analysis. Let me review the grid more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grid again:\n1. There is one large main rectangle\n2. There is one medium-sized rectangle on the right side\n3. Where the rectangles overlap, we see '█' characters, but this doesn't indicate additional rectangles - it just shows where the two existing rectangles intersect\n\nI made a mistake in my previous analysis by counting the overlapping areas as additional rectangles. The '█' characters actually represent where two existing rectangles overlap, not additional rectangles.\n\nLet me modify the code to count correctly:\n\n```python\ndef find_rectangles(grid):\n    # Convert grid to list of strings and remove empty lines\n    grid = [line for line in grid.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    \n    height = len(grid)\n    width = len(grid[0])\n    rectangles = []\n    \n    # Function to check if a point is part of rectangle border\n    def is_border(char):\n        return char in '#█'\n    \n    # Find all rectangles\n    for y in range(height):\n        for x in range(width):\n            if is_border(grid[y][x]):\n                # Found top-left corner\n                if (x == 0 or not is_border(grid[y][x-1])) and (y == 0 or not is_border(grid[y-1][x])):\n                    # Find width\n                    w = 1\n                    while x + w < width and is_border(grid[y][x+w]):\n                        w += 1\n                    \n                    # Find height\n                    h = 1\n                    while y + h < height and is_border(grid[y+h][x]):\n                        h += 1\n                    \n                    # Verify rectangle\n                    is_valid = True\n                    for cy in range(y, y+h):\n                        if not is_border(grid[cy][x]) or not is_border(grid[cy][x+w-1]):\n                            is_valid = False\n                            break\n                    for cx in range(x, x+w):\n                        if not is_border(grid[y][cx]) or not is_border(grid[y+h-1][cx]):\n                            is_valid = False\n                            break\n                    \n                    if is_valid:\n                        rectangles.append((x, y, w, h))\n    \n    print(len(rectangles))\n\n# Your grid\ngrid = \"\"\"                                                                                \n[... rest of the grid ...]\n                                                                                \"\"\"\n\nfind_rectangles(grid)\n```\n\nNow I can provide the correct answer:\n\n<<<3>>>\n\nThe grid contains exactly 3 rectangles:\n1. The large main rectangle\n2. The medium rectangle on the right side\n3. The small rectangle at the bottom right\n\nThe '█' characters indicate where two of these rectangles overlap, but they don't represent additional rectangles.",

One small rectangle at the bottom right\n\nThe '█' characters appear where two rectangles overlap but don't represent additional rectangles.\n\n<<<3>>>",
    "I apologize for my previous incorrect analyses. Let me carefully review the grid again.\n\nLooking at the grid more carefully now, I can see:\n1. One large main rectangle\n2. Two medium-sized rectangles on the right side (they overlap, creating the '█' characters)\n3. Two small rectangles at the bottom (they also overlap, creating the '█' characters)\n\nThe code correctly identified 5 rectangles, and I was wrong in my previous counts. The key insight is that where we see '█' characters, it indicates the overlap of two separate rectangles, and we need to count both rectangles in each overlapping area.\n\nTherefore, I can now confidently provide the correct answer:\n\n<<<5>>>\n\nTo break it down:\n- The large main rectangle (1)\n- Two overlapping rectangles on the right side (2)\n- Two overlapping rectangles at the bottom (2)\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 rectangles\n\nThe code's output of 5 is correct, and I was wrong in my previous visual interpretations. The '█' characters are indeed crucial indicators of overlapping pairs of rectangles, each of which needs to be counted separately."
