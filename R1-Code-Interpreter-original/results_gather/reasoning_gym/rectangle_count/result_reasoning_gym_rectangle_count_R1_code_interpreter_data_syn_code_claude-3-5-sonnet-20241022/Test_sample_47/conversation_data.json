  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "The code executed successfully and produced the correct output of 3, which matches my analysis. Let me confirm why this is the correct answer:\n\n1. The first rectangle is the large one near the top of the grid:\n   - It's approximately 47 characters wide and 29 characters tall\n   - Located at the top portion of the grid\n\n2. The second rectangle is the medium-sized one in the middle:\n   - It's approximately 18 characters wide and 4 characters tall\n   - Located in the middle-lower portion of the grid\n\n3. The third rectangle is the smallest one at the bottom:\n   - It's approximately 14 characters wide and 3 characters tall\n   - Located at the bottom right of the grid\n\nAll rectangles are properly formed with '#' characters for the borders and empty spaces inside. There are no overlapping rectangles (which would have been marked with '█' characters).\n\nThe code correctly identified all three rectangles by:\n1. Finding top-left corners of potential rectangles\n2. Verifying complete rectangular shapes\n3. Counting only valid rectangles that have proper borders and empty interiors\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm the answer:\n\n<<<3>>>"
