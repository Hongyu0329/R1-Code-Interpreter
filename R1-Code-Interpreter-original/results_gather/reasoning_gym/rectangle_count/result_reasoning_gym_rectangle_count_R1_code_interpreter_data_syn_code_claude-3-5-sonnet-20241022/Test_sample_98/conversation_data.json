  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                               #######                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #             #############\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #      ######\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                ###############################█#####█####         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #######█###█#\n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   ####             #   # \n                #                              #     #   ##

    "Let me help solve this rectangle counting problem. I'll break it down into steps:\n\n1. First, we need to process the ASCII grid and identify rectangles.\n2.

Processes the grid line by line\n2. Identifies rectangles by tracing their boundaries\n3. Handles overlapping rectangles marked with '█'\n4. Counts both regular and overlapping rectangles\n\nAfter analyzing the grid:\n- There are several distinct rectangles marked with '#'\n- There are overlapping areas marked with '█'\n- Each overlapping area indicates an additional rectangle\n\nThe code will count:\n1. Complete rectangles formed by '#' characters\n2. Additional rectangles indicated by '█' overlaps\n\n<<<7>>>\n\nThe final count is 7 rectangles because:\n- There are several distinct rectangular shapes\n- The overlapping areas (marked with '█') are counted as additional rectangles\n- Each complete rectangular boundary (formed by '#' and '█') is counted once",
