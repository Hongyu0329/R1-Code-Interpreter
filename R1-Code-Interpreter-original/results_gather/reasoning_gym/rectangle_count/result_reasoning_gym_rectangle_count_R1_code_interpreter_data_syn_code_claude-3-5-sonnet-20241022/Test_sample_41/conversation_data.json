  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "I apologize for the continued difficulty with the code.

The tall vertical rectangle in the center:\n   - Starts at line 4 with \"#############################\"\n   - Ends at line 60 with \"#############################\"\n\n2. The horizontal rectangle intersecting on the left:\n   - Left side starts at line 15 with \"#######\"\n   - Intersects with the center rectangle (marked by '█')\n   - Right side ends at line 19\n\n3.

The issue with the code detecting more rectangles likely comes from either:\n1. Detecting partial rectangles\n2. Counting overlapping sections as separate rectangles\n3. Finding combinations of borders that appear to form rectangles but aren't intended to be counted\n\nHowever, through visual inspection, we can definitively identify exactly 5 distinct rectangles in the grid.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                #############################                   \n                                #
