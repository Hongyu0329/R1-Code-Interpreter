  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "Great! The code executed successfully and confirmed our analysis. Let me explain why the answer is correct:\n\nThe code found exactly 4 rectangles in the ASCII grid:\n\n1. The large rectangle in the middle-top portion of the grid (approximately 21x13 in size)\n2. The medium-sized rectangle on the left bottom (approximately 30x3 in size)\n3. The tall rectangle on the right bottom (approximately 6x10 in size)\n4. The small rectangle at the bottom middle (approximately 19x2 in size)\n\nThe code successfully:\n- Properly parsed the grid\n- Detected complete rectangles by checking for continuous '#' characters\n- Counted each unique rectangle exactly once\n- Handled the grid boundaries correctly\n\nSince both our visual inspection and the code execution agree on the count of 4 rectangles, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.
