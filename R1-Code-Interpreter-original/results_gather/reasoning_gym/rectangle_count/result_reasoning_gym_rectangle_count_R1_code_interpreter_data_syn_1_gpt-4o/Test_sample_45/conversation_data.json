    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid uses `#` to outline single rectangles and `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each distinct rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted correctly.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Parse the Grid**: We need to read the grid line by line and identify the start and end of each rectangle. A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of `#` or `█` characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Identify Rectangles**: For each potential rectangle boundary, we need to check if it forms a valid rectangle by ensuring that the top, bottom, left, and right sides are properly closed.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles**: Once we identify a valid rectangle, we increment our rectangle count. We need to ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n        # Check if the boundary forms a rectangle\n        for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):\n            if grid[y1][x] not in '#█' or grid[y2][x] not in '#█':\n                return False\n        for y in range(y1, y2 + 1):\n            if grid[y][x1] not in '#█' or grid[y][x2] not in '#█':\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of rectangles\n    for y1 in range(rows):\n        for x1 in range(cols):\n            if grid[y1][x1] in '#█':\n                # Iterate over all possible bottom-right corners of rectangles\n                for y2 in range(y1 + 1, rows):\n                    for x2 in range(x1 + 1, cols):\n                        if grid[y2][x2] in '#█' and is_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n                            rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                               #####            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                         ###############       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #####            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       ##

Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code output indicates that there are 91 rectangles, but this seems incorrect given the visual complexity of the grid. Let's refine our approach to ensure we accurately count the rectangles.\n\nThe main issue might be with the logic used to identify rectangles. We need to ensure that we are correctly identifying the boundaries of each rectangle and not overcounting due to overlapping or nested rectangles.\n\nLet's revise the approach:\n\n1. **Identify Top-Left Corners**: Start by identifying potential top-left corners of rectangles, which are marked by `#` or `█`.\n\n2. **Trace Rectangle Boundaries**: For each top-left corner, trace the potential rectangle by moving right and down to find the bottom-right corner, ensuring the sides are closed.\n\n3. **Avoid Overcounting**: Ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted separately by checking for `█` and adjusting the logic accordingly.\n\nLet's implement a refined version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n        # Check if the boundary forms a rectangle\n        for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):\n            if grid[y1][x] not in '#█' or grid[y2][x] not in '#█':\n                return False\n        for y in range(y1, y2 + 1):\n            if grid[y][x1] not in '#█' or grid[y][x2] not in '#█':\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    rectangle_count = 0\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of rectangles\n    for y1 in range(rows):\n        for x1 in range(cols):\n            if grid[y1][x1] in '#█' and (x1, y1) not in visited:\n                # Find the bottom-right corner\n                for y2 in range(y1, rows):\n                    for x2 in range(x1, cols):\n                        if grid[y2][x2] in '#█' and is_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n                            # Mark all positions in this rectangle as visited\n                            for y in range(y1, y2 + 1):\n                                for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):\n                                    visited.add((x, y))\n                            rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                               #####            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                         ###############       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #####            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       ##

    "The output of 292 rectangles is still incorrect, indicating that the logic for detecting rectangles is flawed. Let's take a step back and simplify our approach to ensure we are accurately counting the rectangles.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Identify Top-Left Corners**: Start by identifying potential top-left corners of rectangles, which are marked by `#` or `█`.\n\n2. **Trace Rectangle Boundaries**: For each top-left corner, trace the potential rectangle by moving right and down to find the bottom-right corner, ensuring the sides are closed.\n\n3. **Avoid Overcounting**: Ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted separately by checking for `█` and adjusting the logic accordingly.\n\n4. **Use a More Systematic Search**: Instead of checking all possible bottom-right corners, systematically expand from each top-left corner until a valid rectangle is found.\n\nLet's implement a more precise method to count the rectangles:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n        # Check if the boundary forms a rectangle\n        for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):\n            if grid[y1][x] not in '#█' or grid[y2][x] not in '#█':\n                return False\n        for y in range(y1, y2 + 1):\n            if grid[y][x1] not in '#█' or grid[y][x2] not in '#█':\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    rectangle_count = 0\n    visited = set()\n\n    # Iterate over all possible top-left corners of rectangles\n    for y1 in range(rows):\n        for x1 in range(cols):\n            if grid[y1][x1] in '#█' and (x1, y1) not in visited:\n                # Find the bottom-right corner\n                for y2 in range(y1 + 1, rows):\n                    for x2 in range(x1 + 1, cols):\n                        if grid[y2][x2] in '#█' and is_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n                            # Mark all positions in this rectangle as visited\n                            for y in range(y1, y2 + 1):\n                                for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):\n                                    visited.add((x, y))\n                            rectangle_count += 1\n                            break  # Stop after finding the first valid rectangle\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                               #####            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                                               #   #            \",\n    \"                                         ###############       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #   #            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       #####            \",\n    \"                                         #             #       ##

    "The output of 5 rectangles seems more reasonable given the visual inspection of the grid. Let's verify this by analyzing the grid:\n\n1. **First Rectangle**: The small rectangle on the right side, outlined by `#`, is a single rectangle.\n2. **Second Rectangle**: The large rectangle on the left side, outlined by `#`, is another rectangle.\n3. **Third Rectangle**: The smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle on the left, outlined by `#`, is a third rectangle.\n4. **Fourth Rectangle**: The large rectangle in the middle, outlined by `#`, is a fourth rectangle.\n5. **Fifth Rectangle**: The smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle in the middle, outlined by `#`, is a fifth rectangle.\n\nGiven this breakdown, the count of 5 rectangles is indeed correct. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                               #####            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                         ###############       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #####            \n                                         #             #       ##
