  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid uses `#` to outline single rectangles and `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each unique rectangle by its corners.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- Identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n- Use the `#` and `█` characters to determine the boundaries.\n- Count each rectangle only once, even if it overlaps with another.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    def is_corner(r, c):\n        if grid[r][c] not in ('#', '█'):\n            return False\n        if r > 0 and grid[r-1][c] in ('#', '█'):\n            return False\n        if c > 0 and grid[r][c-1] in ('#', '█'):\n            return False\n        return True\n\n    def mark_rectangle(r, c):\n        nonlocal rectangle_count\n        if visited[r][c]:\n            return\n        visited[r][c] = True\n        if grid[r][c] in ('#', '█'):\n            if is_corner(r, c):\n                rectangle_count += 1\n            if r + 1 < rows and grid[r+1][c] in ('#', '█'):\n                mark_rectangle(r+1, c)\n            if c + 1 < cols and grid[r][c+1] in ('#', '█'):\n                mark_rectangle(r, c+1)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] in ('#', '█') and not visited[r][c]:\n                mark_rectangle(r, c)\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                    ####################################                        \",\n    \"                    #
