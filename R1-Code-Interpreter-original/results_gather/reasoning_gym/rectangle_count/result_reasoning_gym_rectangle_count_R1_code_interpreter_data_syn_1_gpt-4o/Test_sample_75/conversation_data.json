    "To solve this problem, we need to identify and count the number of distinct rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The rectangles are outlined with '#' and overlapping rectangles are shown with '█'. \n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangles**: We need to scan the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of '#' characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count Rectangles**: Once we identify the corners, we can count each distinct rectangle. Overlapping rectangles will be represented by '█', but since the problem states a maximum of 2 overlapping rectangles, we can count these separately.\n\n3. **Implementation**: We will write a Python script to automate the detection and counting of rectangles in the grid.\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_corner(x, y):\n        # Check if the current position is a corner of a rectangle\n        if grid[x][y] != '#':\n            return False\n        # Check surrounding positions to determine if it's a corner\n        if (x > 0 and grid[x-1][y] == '#') and (y > 0 and grid[x][y-1] == '#'):\n            return True\n        if (x > 0 and grid[x-1][y] == '#') and (y < len(grid[0]) - 1 and grid[x][y+1] == '#'):\n            return True\n        if (x < len(grid) - 1 and grid[x+1][y] == '#') and (y > 0 and grid[x][y-1] == '#'):\n            return True\n        if (x < len(grid) - 1 and grid[x+1][y] == '#') and (y < len(grid[0]) - 1 and grid[x][y+1] == '#'):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    def mark_rectangle(x, y):\n        # Mark the rectangle starting from (x, y)\n        stack = [(x, y)]\n        while stack:\n            cx, cy = stack.pop()\n            if grid[cx][cy] == '#':\n                grid[cx][cy] = '.'\n                if cx > 0 and grid[cx-1][cy] == '#':\n                    stack.append((cx-1, cy))\n                if cx < len(grid) - 1 and grid[cx+1][cy] == '#':\n                    stack.append((cx+1, cy))\n                if cy > 0 and grid[cx][cy-1] == '#':\n                    stack.append((cx, cy-1))\n                if cy < len(grid[0]) - 1 and grid[cx][cy+1] == '#':\n                    stack.append((cx, cy+1))\n\n    rectangle_count = 0\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if is_corner(i, j):\n                rectangle_count += 1\n                mark_rectangle(i, j)\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                   #######################                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #                     #                      \",\n    \"                                   #######################                      \",\n    \"                                                                          ######\",\n    \"                                                                          #    #\",\n    \"                                                                          #    #\",\n    \"                                                                          #    #\",\n    \"                                                                          #    #\",\n    \"                                                                          #    #\",\n    \"                                                                          #    #\",\n    \"                                                                          #    #\",\n    \"                 ##############################                           #    #\",\n    \"                 #                            #                           #    #\",\n    \"                 #                            #                           #    #\",\n    \"                 ##############################                           ######\",\n    \"                                #####################                           \",\n    \"                                #                   #                           \",\n    \"                                #####################                           \"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to list of lists\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Count rectangles\nrectangle_count = count_rectangles(grid)\nprint(rectangle_count)\n```\n\nThis script will count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid.
