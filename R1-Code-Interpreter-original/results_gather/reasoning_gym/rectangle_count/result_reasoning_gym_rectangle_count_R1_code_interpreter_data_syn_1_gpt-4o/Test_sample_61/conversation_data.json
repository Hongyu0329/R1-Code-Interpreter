    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. Rectangles are defined by the '#' character, and overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Counting distinct rectangles by identifying unique sets of boundaries.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangle Boundaries**: \n   - A rectangle is defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners.\n   - We need to find all such pairs of corners in the grid.\n\n2. **Handle Overlapping Rectangles**:\n   - The '█' character indicates overlapping rectangles. We need to ensure that we count each rectangle only once.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles**:\n   - Once we have identified all unique rectangles, we can count them.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles in the grid.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    rectangles = set()\n\n    for r1 in range(rows):\n        for c1 in range(cols):\n            if grid[r1][c1] in ['#', '█']:\n                for r2 in range(r1 + 1, rows):\n                    for c2 in range(c1 + 1, cols):\n                        if grid[r1][c2] in ['#', '█'] and grid[r2][c1] in ['#', '█'] and grid[r2][c2] in ['#', '█']:\n                            is_rectangle = True\n                            for r in range(r1, r2 + 1):\n                                if grid[r][c1] not in ['#', '█'] or grid[r][c2] not in ['#', '█']:\n                                    is_rectangle = False\n                                    break\n                            for c in range(c1, c2 + 1):\n                                if grid[r1][c] not in ['#', '█'] or grid[r2][c] not in ['#', '█']:\n                                    is_rectangle = False\n                                    break\n                            if is_rectangle:\n                                rectangles.add((r1, c1, r2, c2))\n\n    return len(rectangles)\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"###########################################███████████████###############   \",\n    \"#                                          #
