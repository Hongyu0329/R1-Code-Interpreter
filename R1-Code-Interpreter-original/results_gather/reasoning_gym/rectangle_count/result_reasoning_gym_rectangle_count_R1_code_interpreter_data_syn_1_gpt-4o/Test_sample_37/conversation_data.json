    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the ASCII grid and count the number of rectangles. Rectangles are defined by the '#' character for their borders, and overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Borders**: We need to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. This can be done by scanning the grid for '#' characters that form a continuous line horizontally and vertically.\n\n2. **Count Rectangles**: Once we have identified the corners, we can count the number of distinct rectangles. Overlapping rectangles will be indicated by the '█' character, but in this grid, we only have '#' characters, so we don't need to worry about overlaps.\n\n3. **Implementation**: We will write a Python script to automate this process. The script will:\n   - Read the grid line by line.\n   - Identify the start and end of each rectangle by detecting continuous '#' characters.\n   - Count the number of rectangles.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid as a list of strings\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"            ########################                                            \",\n    \"            #
