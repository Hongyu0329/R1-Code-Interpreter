    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the ASCII grid and count the number of rectangles. Rectangles are defined by the '#' character, and overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Scanning the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each unique rectangle, considering overlaps.\n\nLet's break down the grid and identify the rectangles:\n\n1. The first rectangle starts at the top-left corner of the grid and extends to the bottom-right corner where the first '█' character appears.\n2. The second rectangle overlaps with the first one and starts at the first '█' character, extending to the bottom-right corner of the grid.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this counting process:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid as a list of strings\ngrid = [\n    \"                                       #########################################\",\n    \"                                       #
