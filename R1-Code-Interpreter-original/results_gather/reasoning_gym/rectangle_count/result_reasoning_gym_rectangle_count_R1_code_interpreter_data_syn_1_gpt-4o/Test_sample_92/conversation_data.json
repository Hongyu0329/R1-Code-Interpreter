  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "The `IndexError` suggests that the code is trying to access an index that is out of bounds. This can happen if the grid is not being accessed correctly, especially when checking for corners or boundaries.\n\nLet's carefully review the logic for checking corners and accessing the grid. We need to ensure that we are not accessing indices that are out of the grid's range. \n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Ensure that the grid is accessed within its bounds.\n2.

This error typically occurs when the logic for accessing the grid is incorrect, especially when checking for corners or boundaries.\n\nLet's carefully review the logic for checking corners and accessing the grid. We need to ensure that we are not accessing indices that are out of the grid's range. \n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Ensure that the grid is accessed within its bounds.\n2.

    "The `IndexError` suggests that the code is trying to access an index that is out of bounds. This error typically occurs when the logic for accessing the grid is incorrect, especially when checking for corners or boundaries.\n\nLet's carefully review the logic for checking corners and accessing the grid. We need to ensure that we are not accessing indices that are out of the grid's range. \n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Ensure that the grid is accessed within its bounds.\n2.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.
