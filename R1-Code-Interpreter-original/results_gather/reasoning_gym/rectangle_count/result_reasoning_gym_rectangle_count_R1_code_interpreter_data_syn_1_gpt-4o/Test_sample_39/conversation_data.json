  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid uses `#` to outline rectangles and `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Parse the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Count each distinct rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\nLet's break down the grid into manageable parts and identify the rectangles:\n\n1. **Top Right Rectangle**: \n   - Starts at (65, 1) and ends at (77, 6).\n\n2. **Middle Left Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at (40, 3) and ends at (54, 28).\n\n3. **Middle Right Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at (65, 3) and ends at (77, 28).\n\n4. **Bottom Right Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at (67, 60) and ends at (74, 66).\n\n5. **Bottom Left Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at (11, 62) and ends at (38, 64).\n\n6. **Overlapping Rectangle**:\n   - The overlapping area is marked by `█` and is part of the middle rectangles. It starts at (40, 28) and ends at (77, 28).\n\nNow, let's count these rectangles. We have identified 5 distinct rectangles and 1 overlapping rectangle, which means we have a total of 6 rectangles.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a Python script to count the rectangles programmatically.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid as a list of strings\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                                 ############   \",\n    \"                                                                 #
