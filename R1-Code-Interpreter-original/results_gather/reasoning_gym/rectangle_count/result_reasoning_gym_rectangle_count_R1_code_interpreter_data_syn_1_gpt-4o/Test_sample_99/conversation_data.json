  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct rectangles in the given ASCII grid. Rectangles are defined by their borders, which are represented by the '#' character. Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character, which means that two rectangles share that part of the border.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify all unique rectangles.\n2. Counting each rectangle only once, even if it overlaps with another.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- We will iterate through each character in the grid.\n- When we encounter a '#', we will attempt to trace the rectangle by moving right and down until we find the complete rectangle.\n- If we encounter a '█', it indicates an overlap, and we need to ensure we count both rectangles involved.\n- We will maintain a set of identified rectangles to avoid double-counting.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = set()\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    def trace_rectangle(r, c):\n        #
