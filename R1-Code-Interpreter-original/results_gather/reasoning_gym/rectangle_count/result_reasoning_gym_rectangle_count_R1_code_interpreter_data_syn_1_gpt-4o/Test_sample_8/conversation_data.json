  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

Let's verify the logic and ensure that the rectangles are being counted correctly:\n\n1. **Identify Top-Left Corners**: We start by identifying potential top-left corners of rectangles, which are marked by '#' or '█'.\n2. **Expand to Bottom-Right Corners**: For each top-left corner, we attempt to expand to find the largest possible rectangle by checking the bottom and right edges.\n3. **Validate Rectangles**: Ensure that the identified corners form a valid rectangle by checking all edges.\n4. **Count Unique Rectangles**: Use a set to store unique rectangles to avoid double-counting.\n\nGiven the grid and the logic, the output of 12 indicates that there are 12 distinct rectangles in the grid. \n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<12>>>"
