    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid is composed of spaces and '#' characters, where '#' characters outline rectangles. Overlapping rectangles are shown with '█', but in this grid, we only have '#' characters.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangles**: A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of '#' characters forming a closed loop. We need to identify these loops.\n\n2. **Count Rectangles**: Once identified, we count each distinct rectangle.\n\nThe grid provided is large, but we can see that there are two distinct rectangles:\n\n- A large outer rectangle.\n- A smaller rectangle inside the larger one.\n\nTo automate this process, we can write a Python script to parse the grid and count the rectangles. The script will:\n\n- Traverse the grid to find the top-left corner of each rectangle.\n- Follow the '#' characters to determine the boundaries of each rectangle.\n- Count each distinct rectangle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_top_left_corner(x, y):\n        return (grid[x][y] == '#' and\n                (x == 0 or grid[x-1][y] == ' ') and\n                (y == 0 or grid[x][y-1] == ' '))\n\n    def mark_rectangle(x, y):\n        # Mark the rectangle as visited\n        max_x, max_y = x, y\n        while max_x < len(grid) and grid[max_x][y] == '#':\n            max_x += 1\n        while max_y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][max_y] == '#':\n            max_y += 1\n        for i in range(x, max_x):\n            for j in range(y, max_y):\n                visited[i][j] = True\n\n    visited = [[False] * len(grid[0]) for _ in range(len(grid))]\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if is_top_left_corner(i, j) and not visited[i][j]:\n                rectangle_count += 1\n                mark_rectangle(i, j)\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                       ######################                                   \",\n    \"                       #

Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code output indicates that only one rectangle was detected, which is incorrect because there are two rectangles: the large outer rectangle and the smaller inner rectangle. Let's refine the logic to correctly identify both rectangles.\n\nThe issue might be with how the script identifies and marks rectangles. We need to ensure that the script can detect nested rectangles. Let's adjust the logic to handle this:\n\n1. **Identify Top-Left Corners**: Ensure that the detection of the top-left corner of a rectangle is accurate.\n2. **Mark Rectangles**: Ensure that marking a rectangle does not interfere with detecting nested rectangles.\n\nLet's revise the code:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_top_left_corner(x, y):\n        return (grid[x][y] == '#' and\n                (x == 0 or grid[x-1][y] == ' ') and\n                (y == 0 or grid[x][y-1] == ' '))\n\n    def mark_rectangle(x, y):\n        #

    "The issue seems to be with the logic for detecting and marking rectangles. The current approach might not be correctly identifying nested rectangles. Let's refine the approach to ensure that both the outer and inner rectangles are detected.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. **Identify Top-Left Corners**: We need to ensure that the detection of the top-left corner of a rectangle is accurate. A top-left corner is where a '#' is found, and it is not part of a previously detected rectangle.\n\n2. **Mark Rectangles**: We need to ensure that marking a rectangle does not interfere with detecting nested rectangles.
