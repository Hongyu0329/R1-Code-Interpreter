    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. Rectangles are defined by the '#' character, and overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Scanning the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each unique rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- Traverse the grid to find the top-left corner of each rectangle, which is identified by a '#' character that is not part of a previously identified rectangle.\n- For each top-left corner, find the corresponding bottom-right corner by extending the rectangle downwards and rightwards until the boundary of '#' characters is reached.\n- Use the '█' character to identify overlapping rectangles and ensure they are counted separately.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    def mark_rectangle(r, c):\n        #

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                  #############################                 \n                                  #                           #                 \n                                  #                           #                 \n                                  #                           #                 \n                                  #                           #                 \n                                  #    ######                 #                 \n                                  #    #    #                 #                 \n            ######################█####█####█##########       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    ######         #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     █###################█##     #                 \n            #                     █                   # #     #      ########## \n            #                     █                   # #     #      #        # \n            #                     █                   # #     #      #        # \n            #                     █                   # #     #      #        # \n            #                     █###################█##     #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      ########## \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            ######################█████████████████████#######█######           \n                                  ##
