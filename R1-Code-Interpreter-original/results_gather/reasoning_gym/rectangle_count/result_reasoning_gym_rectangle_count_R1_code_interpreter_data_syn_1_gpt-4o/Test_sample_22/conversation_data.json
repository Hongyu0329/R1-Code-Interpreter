  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid uses `#` to outline single rectangles and `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Counting distinct rectangles by identifying unique sets of boundaries.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangle Boundaries**: \n   - A rectangle is defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners.\n   - We need to scan the grid to find these corners.\n\n2. **Count Rectangles**:\n   - For each identified rectangle, check if it overlaps with another rectangle.\n   - Count each unique rectangle only once.\n\n3. **Handle Overlaps**:\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by `█`.\n   - We need to ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted correctly.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    def is_rectangle(r, c):\n        if grid[r][c] not in ['#', '█'] or visited[r][c]:\n            return False\n        # Find the bottom-right corner of the rectangle\n        end_r, end_c = r, c\n        while end_c < cols and grid[r][end_c] in ['#', '█']:\n            end_c += 1\n        while end_r < rows and grid[end_r][c] in ['#', '█']:\n            end_r += 1\n        # Check if it's a valid rectangle\n        for i in range(r, end_r):\n            for j in range(c, end_c):\n                if grid[i][j] not in ['#', '█']:\n                    return False\n        # Mark the rectangle as visited\n        for i in range(r, end_r):\n            for j in range(c, end_c):\n                visited[i][j] = True\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if is_rectangle(i, j):\n                rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                          ###########################           \",\n    \"                                          #                         #           \",\n    \"                                          #                   ######█########   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #                   #     #       #   \",\n    \"                                          #             ######█#####█########   \",\n    \"                                          #             #     #     #      ##

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                          ###########################           \n                                          #                         #           \n                                          #                   ######█########   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #             ######█#####█########   \n                                          #             #     #     #      ##
