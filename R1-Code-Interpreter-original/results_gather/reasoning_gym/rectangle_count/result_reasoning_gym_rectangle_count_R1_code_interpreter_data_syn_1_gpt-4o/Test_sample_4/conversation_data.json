  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid.

Counting each distinct rectangle, considering overlaps.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- Traverse the grid to find the top-left corner of each rectangle.\n- For each top-left corner, determine the bottom-right corner by extending downwards and rightwards until the boundary is reached.\n- Use a set to store unique rectangles to avoid double-counting.\n- Count the number of unique rectangles.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = set()\n    rectangles = set()\n\n    def find_rectangle(r, c):\n        if (r, c) in visited or grid[r][c] not in ('#', '█'):\n            return None\n        #
