  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid uses `#` to outline single rectangles and `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each distinct rectangle, considering overlaps.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangles**: \n   - A rectangle is defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners.\n   - We need to find all such pairs of corners that form valid rectangles.\n\n2. **Handle Overlaps**:\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by `█`.\n   - We need to ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted correctly.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles**:\n   - Count each unique rectangle found in the grid.\n\nTo implement this, we can write a Python script to parse the grid and count the rectangles. Let's proceed with the code:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    rectangles = 0\n\n    # Function to check if a rectangle is valid\n    def is_valid_rectangle(r1, c1, r2, c2):\n        if r1 >= r2 or c1 >= c2:\n            return False\n        for r in range(r1, r2 + 1):\n            if grid[r][c1] not in '#█' or grid[r][c2] not in '#█':\n                return False\n        for c in range(c1, c2 + 1):\n            if grid[r1][c] not in '#█' or grid[r2][c] not in '#█':\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    #
