    "To solve this problem, we need to identify and count the rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid contains two types of characters that define rectangles: `#` for single rectangles and `█` for overlapping rectangles. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Scanning the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n2. Counting the number of unique rectangles based on these corners.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangle Corners:**\n   - A rectangle is defined by its top-left corner and bottom-right corner.\n   - The top-left corner is identified by a `#` or `█` that has no `#` or `█` directly above or to the left.\n   - The bottom-right corner is identified by a `#` or `█` that has no `#` or `█` directly below or to the right.\n\n2. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - For each identified top-left corner, find the corresponding bottom-right corner.\n   - Count each unique rectangle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid as a list of strings\ngrid = [\n    \"                                         #########                              \",\n    \"                                         #
