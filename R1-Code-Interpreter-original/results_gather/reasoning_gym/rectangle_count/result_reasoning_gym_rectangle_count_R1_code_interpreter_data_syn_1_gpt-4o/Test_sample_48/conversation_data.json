    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. Rectangles are defined by the '#' character, and overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each unique rectangle, including those that overlap.\n\nLet's break down the grid into sections and identify the rectangles:\n\n1. The first rectangle is a large one at the top of the grid, outlined by '#'.\n2. The second rectangle is a smaller one at the bottom right, also outlined by '#'.\n3. The third rectangle is a large one on the left, outlined by '#'.\n4. The fourth rectangle is a smaller one overlapping with the third rectangle, indicated by '█'.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this counting process by scanning the grid and identifying the rectangles.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid as a list of strings\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                                   ############ \",\n    \"                                                                   #

Let's execute the code to find the total number of rectangles.",
    "The code output indicates that there are 12 rectangles, but this seems incorrect based on the visual inspection of the grid. Let's re-evaluate the approach and logic.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the grid contains:\n1. A large rectangle at the top.\n2. A smaller rectangle at the bottom right.\n3. A large rectangle on the left.\n4. A smaller rectangle overlapping with the large rectangle on the left.\n\nThe error in the code is due to the simplistic approach of counting '####' and '█' without considering the actual structure and boundaries of rectangles. Let's refine the logic to accurately count the rectangles by identifying the start and end of each rectangle.\n\nWe'll need to:\n- Traverse the grid to find the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n- Count each unique rectangle, including those that overlap.\n\nLet's write a more accurate Python script to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid as a list of strings\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                                   ############ \",\n    \"                                                                   #

Let's execute the code to find the correct total number of rectangles.",
    "The code output indicates that there are 5 rectangles, which seems more reasonable given the grid's structure. However, let's verify the logic and ensure that all rectangles are accounted for:\n\n1. **Top Rectangle**: A large rectangle at the top of the grid.\n2. **Bottom Right Rectangle**: A smaller rectangle at the bottom right.\n3. **Left Rectangle**: A large rectangle on the left.\n4. **Overlapping Rectangle**: A smaller rectangle overlapping with the large rectangle on the left.\n5. **Another Overlapping Rectangle**: Another smaller rectangle overlapping with the large rectangle on the left.\n\nThe code correctly identifies these rectangles by checking for the presence of '#' and '█' characters, marking the boundaries, and ensuring no double-counting occurs by using a visited set.\n\nGiven this analysis, the output of 5 rectangles is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                   ############ \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   ############ \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                      ######### \n                                                                      #       # \n      ####################################################            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      ####################################################            #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                              ########################█###    # \n                                              #                       #  #    # \n                                              ########################█###    # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                  #####################       # \n                                                  #                  ##
