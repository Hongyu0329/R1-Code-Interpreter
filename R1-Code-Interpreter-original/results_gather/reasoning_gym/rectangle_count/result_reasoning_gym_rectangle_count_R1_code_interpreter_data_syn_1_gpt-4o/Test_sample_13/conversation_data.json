    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct rectangles in the given ASCII grid. Rectangles are defined by the '#' character, and overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Scanning the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each distinct rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\nLet's break down the grid and identify the rectangles:\n\n1. The first rectangle is the large one at the top, spanning from the first row of '#' to the last row of '#' in that section.\n2. The second rectangle is the vertical one on the right side, starting from the first row of '#' in that section to the last row of '#'.\n3. The third rectangle is the horizontal one at the bottom, spanning from the first column of '#' in that section to the last column of '#'.\n4. The fourth rectangle is the large one at the bottom, spanning from the first row of '#' in that section to the last row of '#'.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this counting process:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_corner(x, y):\n        return (grid[x][y] == '#' and\n                ((x > 0 and grid[x-1][y] == ' ') or x == 0) and\n                ((y > 0 and grid[x][y-1] == ' ') or y == 0))\n\n    def find_rectangle(x, y):\n        max_x, max_y = x, y\n        while max_x + 1 < len(grid) and grid[max_x + 1][y] in ['#', '█']:\n            max_x += 1\n        while max_y + 1 < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][max_y + 1] in ['#', '█']:\n            max_y += 1\n        return max_x, max_y\n\n    visited = set()\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if is_corner(i, j) and (i, j) not in visited:\n                max_x, max_y = find_rectangle(i, j)\n                for x in range(i, max_x + 1):\n                    for y in range(j, max_y + 1):\n                        visited.add((x, y))\n                rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\ngrid = [\n    \"                                      ########################                  \",\n    \"                                      #
