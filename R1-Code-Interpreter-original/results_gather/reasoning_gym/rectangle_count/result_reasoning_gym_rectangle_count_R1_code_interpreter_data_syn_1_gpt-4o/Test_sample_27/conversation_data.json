    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The rectangles are outlined with '#' and overlapping rectangles are shown with '█'. \n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangles**: We need to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of '#' or '█' characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count Overlapping Rectangles**: The '█' character indicates overlapping rectangles. We need to ensure that we count each rectangle only once.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Traverse the grid to find the top-left corner of each rectangle.\n   - For each top-left corner, find the corresponding bottom-right corner.\n   - Count each rectangle found.\n   - Handle overlapping rectangles by counting them separately.\n\n4. **Implementation**: We will write a Python script to automate this process.\n\nLet's implement the code to count the rectangles:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_corner(x, y):\n        return grid[x][y] in ['#', '█']\n\n    def find_bottom_right(x, y):\n        max_x, max_y = x, y\n        while max_x + 1 < len(grid) and grid[max_x + 1][y] in ['#', '█']:\n            max_x += 1\n        while max_y + 1 < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][max_y + 1] in ['#', '█']:\n            max_y += 1\n        return max_x, max_y\n\n    visited = set()\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if (i, j) not in visited and is_corner(i, j):\n                bottom_right = find_bottom_right(i, j)\n                for x in range(i, bottom_right[0] + 1):\n                    for y in range(j, bottom_right[1] + 1):\n                        visited.add((x, y))\n                rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                      ####                                      \",\n    \"          ############################█##█#############################         \",\n    \"          #

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.
