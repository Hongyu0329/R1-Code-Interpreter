The rectangles are outlined with '#' and overlapping rectangles are shown with '█'. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each unique rectangle by checking the continuity of '#' or '█' characters.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- Traverse the grid row by row and column by column.\n- Identify the start of a rectangle by finding a '#' or '█' that is not part of an already counted rectangle.\n- Once a start is found, determine the extent of the rectangle by moving right and down until the rectangle is fully enclosed.\n- Mark the rectangle as counted to avoid double counting.\n- Continue until the entire grid is processed.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    def is_rectangle_start(r, c):\n        return (grid[r][c] == '#' or grid[r][c] == '█') and not visited[r][c]\n\n    def mark_rectangle(r, c):\n        nonlocal rectangle_count\n        # Find the extent of the rectangle\n        end_r, end_c = r, c\n        while end_c < cols and (grid[r][end_c] == '#' or grid[r][end_c] == '█'):\n            end_c += 1\n        while end_r < rows and (grid[end_r][c] == '#' or grid[end_r][c] == '█'):\n            end_r += 1\n        # Mark the rectangle as visited\n        for i in range(r, end_r):\n            for j in range(c, end_c):\n                visited[i][j] = True\n        rectangle_count += 1\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if is_rectangle_start(r, c):\n                mark_rectangle(r, c)\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                               ###              \",\n    \"                                                               # #              \",\n    \"                                                               # #              \",\n    \"                                                               # #              \",\n    \"                                                               # #              \",\n    \"                                                               # #              \",\n    \"                                                               # #              \",\n    \"                     #######################################   # #              \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #              \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #              \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #              \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #              \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #              \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #              \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #       ###    \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   ########          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \",\n    \"                     #              #####█######█##########█###█#█       # #    \",\n    \"                     #              #    #      #          #   # █       # #    \",\n    \"                     #              #    #      #          #   ##█       # #    \",\n    \"       ##############█##############█####█######█##########█#####█#######█#█#   \",\n    \"       #             #              #    #      #          #     #       # ##

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                               ###              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                     #######################################   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #       ###    \n                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \n                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \n                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   ########          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #              #####█######█##########█###█#█       # #    \n                     #              #    #      #          #   # █       # #    \n                     #              #    #      #          #   ##█       # #    \n       ##############█##############█####█######█##########█#####█#######█#█#   \n       #             #              #    #      #          #     #       # ##
