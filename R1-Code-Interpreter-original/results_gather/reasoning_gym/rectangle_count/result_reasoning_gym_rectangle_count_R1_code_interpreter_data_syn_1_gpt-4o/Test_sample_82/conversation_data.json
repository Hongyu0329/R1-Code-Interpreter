    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid contains rectangles outlined with '#' and overlapping rectangles with '█'. \n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangles**: We need to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of '#' or '█' characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count Overlapping Rectangles**: If there are overlapping rectangles, they will be represented by '█'. We need to ensure that we count these correctly, considering the overlap.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Grid**: We will iterate through each character in the grid to identify the start and end of each rectangle.\n\n4. **Use Python Code for Counting**: We will write a Python script to automate the counting process. The script will parse the grid, identify rectangles, and count them.\n\nLet's write the Python code to implement this logic:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    def is_rectangle(r, c):\n        if grid[r][c] not in ('#', '█') or visited[r][c]:\n            return False\n        # Find the bottom-right corner of the rectangle\n        end_r, end_c = r, c\n        while end_c < cols and grid[r][end_c] in ('#', '█'):\n            end_c += 1\n        while end_r < rows and grid[end_r][c] in ('#', '█'):\n            end_r += 1\n        # Check if it's a valid rectangle\n        for i in range(r, end_r):\n            for j in range(c, end_c):\n                if grid[i][j] not in ('#', '█'):\n                    return False\n                visited[i][j] = True\n        return True\n\n    rectangle_count = 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if is_rectangle(r, c):\n                rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                                    ####███#    \",\n    \"                                                                    #   # ##    \",\n    \"                                                                    #   # ##    \",\n    \"                                                                    #   # ##    \",\n    \"                                                                    #   # ##    \",\n    \"                                                                    #   # ##    \",\n    \"                                                                    #   # ##    \",\n    \"                                                                    #   # ##    \",\n    \"                                                                    ####█#█#    \",\n    \"                                                                        # #     \",\n    \"                                                                        # #     \",\n    \"                                                                        # #     \",\n    \"                                                                        # #     \",\n    \"                                                                        # #     \",\n    \"                                                                        # #     \",\n    \"                                                                        # #     \",\n    \"                                                                        ###     \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"      ######################                                                    \",\n    \"      #                    #                                                    \",\n    \"      #                    #                                                    \",\n    \"      #                    #                                                    \",\n    \"      #                    #                                                    \",\n    \"      #                    #                                                    \",\n    \"      #                    #                                                    \",\n    \"      #                    #                                                    \",\n    \"      #                    #                                      #######       \",\n    \"      #                    #                                      #     #       \",\n    \"      ######################                                      #######       \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n    \"                                                                                \",\n]\n\n# Count the rectangles\nrectangle_count = count_rectangles(grid)\nprint(rectangle_count)\n```\n\nThis code will count the number of rectangles in the grid by checking each character and determining if it is part of a rectangle.
