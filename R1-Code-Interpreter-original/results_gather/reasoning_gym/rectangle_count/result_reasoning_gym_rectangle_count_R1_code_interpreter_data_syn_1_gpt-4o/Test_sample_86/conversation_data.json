  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify and count the number of distinct rectangles in the given ASCII grid. Rectangles are defined by the '#' character, and overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Scanning the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each distinct rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\nLet's break down the grid and identify the rectangles:\n\n1. The first rectangle is clearly visible at the top of the grid, spanning from the first row of '#' characters to the fourth row.\n2. The second rectangle starts at the 10th column and extends downwards, forming a vertical rectangle.\n3. The third rectangle is at the bottom right, starting from the 50th column and extending downwards.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate the counting of these rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_corner(x, y):\n        # Check if the current position is a corner of a rectangle\n        if grid[x][y] != '#':\n            return False\n        # Check for top-left corner\n        if (x == 0 or grid[x-1][y] == ' ') and (y == 0 or grid[x][y-1] == ' '):\n            return True\n        # Check for bottom-right corner\n        if (x == len(grid) - 1 or grid[x+1][y] == ' ') and (y == len(grid[0]) - 1 or grid[x][y+1] == ' '):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    rectangle_count = 0\n    visited = set()\n\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            if (i, j) not in visited and is_corner(i, j):\n                #

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n  #########################################                                     \n  #
