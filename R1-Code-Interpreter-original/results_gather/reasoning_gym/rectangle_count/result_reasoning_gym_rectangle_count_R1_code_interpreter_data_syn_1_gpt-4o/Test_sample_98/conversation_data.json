  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid contains rectangles outlined with `#` and overlapping rectangles are shown with `█`. \n\nThe approach to solve this problem involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each unique rectangle by identifying its top-left and bottom-right corners.\n3. Considering overlapping rectangles, which are indicated by `█`.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Parse the Grid**: We will iterate through each character in the grid to identify the start and end of rectangles. A rectangle starts with a `#` or `█` and ends with a `#` or `█`.\n\n2. **Identify Rectangles**: For each potential rectangle start, we will try to find the corresponding end by checking horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles**: We will maintain a count of unique rectangles. Overlapping rectangles will be counted separately.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = grid.strip().split('\\n')\n    height = len(rows)\n    width = len(rows[0]) if height > 0 else 0\n\n    def is_rectangle_char(c):\n        return c == '#' or c == '█'\n\n    def find_rectangle_end(r, c):\n        #

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                               #######                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #             #############\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #      ######\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                ###############################█#####█####         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #######█###█#\n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   ####             #   # \n                #                              #     #   ##
