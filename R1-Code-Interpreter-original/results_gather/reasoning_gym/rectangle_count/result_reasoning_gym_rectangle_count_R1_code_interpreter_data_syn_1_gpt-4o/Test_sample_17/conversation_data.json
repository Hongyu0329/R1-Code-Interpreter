  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid.

    "The `IndexError` suggests that the code is attempting to access an index that is out of range. This can happen if the grid lines have varying lengths, which is common in ASCII art. We need to ensure that we only access valid indices within each line.\n\nTo address this, we should check the length of each line before accessing its characters.

Check if this is the top-left corner of an overlapping rectangle\n                if (i == 0 or j >= len(lines[i-1]) or lines[i-1][j] != '█') and (j == 0 or lines[i][j-1] != '█'):\n                    overlapping_rectangles += 1\n    \n    #
