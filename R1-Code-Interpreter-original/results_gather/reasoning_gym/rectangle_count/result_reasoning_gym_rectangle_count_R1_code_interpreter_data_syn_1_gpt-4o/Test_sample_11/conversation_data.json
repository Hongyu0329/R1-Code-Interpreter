  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the ASCII grid and count the number of rectangles. Rectangles are defined by the '#' character outlining them, and overlapping rectangles are shown with the '█' character. \n\nGiven the grid, we can see that there is a single rectangle outlined by the '#' character. There are no overlapping rectangles indicated by the '█' character. \n\nLet's write a Python script to count the rectangles in the grid. The script will scan through the grid, identify the top-left corners of rectangles, and then trace the outline to confirm the presence of a rectangle.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    # Function to check if a rectangle starts at (r, c)\n    def is_rectangle_start(r, c):\n        if grid[r][c] != '#':\n            return False\n        # Check if it's the top-left corner of a rectangle\n        if (r == 0 or grid[r-1][c] == ' ') and (c == 0 or grid[r][c-1] == ' '):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    # Scan the grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if is_rectangle_start(r, c):\n                rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                    ############                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    #          #                                \",\n    \"                                    ############                                \"\n]\n\n# Count rectangles\nrectangle_count = count_rectangles(grid)\nprint(rectangle_count)\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to determine the number of rectangles in the grid.",
