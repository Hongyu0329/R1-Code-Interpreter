    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The rectangles are outlined with `#`, and overlapping rectangles are shown with `█`. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Parse the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Count the number of distinct rectangles.\n\nLet's break down the grid into sections and identify the rectangles:\n\n1. **Top Rectangle**: \n   - Starts at the 4th row and spans downwards until the 52nd row.\n   - It spans horizontally from the 33rd column to the 61st column.\n\n2. **Middle Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at the 14th row and spans downwards until the 18th row.\n   - It spans horizontally from the 26th column to the 52nd column.\n   - This rectangle overlaps with the top rectangle, indicated by the `█` character.\n\n3. **Bottom Left Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at the 58th row and spans downwards until the 64th row.\n   - It spans horizontally from the 16th column to the 42nd column.\n\n4. **Bottom Right Rectangle**:\n   - Starts at the 62nd row and spans downwards until the 68th row.\n   - It spans horizontally from the 48th column to the 64th column.\n   - This rectangle overlaps with the bottom left rectangle, indicated by the `█` character.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to count these rectangles:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid as a list of strings\ngrid = [\n    \"                                #############################                   \",\n    \"                                #
