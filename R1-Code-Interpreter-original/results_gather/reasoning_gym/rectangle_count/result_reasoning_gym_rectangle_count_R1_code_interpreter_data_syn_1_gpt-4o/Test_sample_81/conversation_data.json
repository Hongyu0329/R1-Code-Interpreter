  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify and count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid is represented by characters, where '#' denotes the edges of a rectangle, and '█' denotes overlapping rectangles. \n\nThe grid provided seems to have a single rectangle outlined by '#'. We need to count this rectangle. \n\nLet's break down the steps to identify rectangles:\n1. Identify the top-left corner of a rectangle, which is a '#' character.\n2. From the top-left corner, find the bottom-right corner by looking for the next '#' character in the same row and column.\n3. Ensure that the sides of the rectangle are completely formed by '#' characters.\n4. Count each valid rectangle found.\n\nGiven the grid provided, it appears to be a simple case with a single rectangle.
