  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the ASCII grid and count the number of rectangles. Rectangles are defined by the presence of '#' characters forming a closed loop. Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character, but in this grid, we only see '#' characters.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the boundaries of rectangles**: We need to find the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. This can be done by scanning the grid for '#' characters and determining if they form a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count the rectangles**: Once we have identified the boundaries, we can count how many distinct rectangles are present.\n\nGiven the grid provided, it seems there is a single rectangle. However, to ensure accuracy, let's write a Python script to automate the detection and counting of rectangles.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                  ########                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  #      #                                      \",\n    \"                                  ########                                      \"\n]\n\n# Function to count rectangles\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    # Initialize variables\n    rectangle_count = 0\n    visited = set()\n    \n    # Function to check if a point is within bounds and is a '#'\n    def is_rectangle_char(x, y):\n        return 0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][y] == '#'\n    \n    # Function to explore a rectangle starting from the top-left corner\n    def explore_rectangle(x, y):\n        # Find the bottom-right corner\n        max_x, max_y = x, y\n        while is_rectangle_char(max_x + 1, y):\n            max_x += 1\n        while is_rectangle_char(x, max_y + 1):\n            max_y += 1\n        \n        # Mark all '#' in the rectangle as visited\n        for i in range(x, max_x + 1):\n            for j in range(y, max_y + 1):\n                visited.add((i, j))\n    \n    # Iterate over the grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if (i, j) not in visited and grid[i][j] == '#':\n                # Found a new rectangle\n                rectangle_count += 1\n                explore_rectangle(i, j)\n    \n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Count the rectangles in the grid\nrectangle_count = count_rectangles(grid)\nprint(rectangle_count)\n```\n\nThis script will count the number of rectangles by identifying the top-left corner of each rectangle and exploring its boundaries. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
