  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid uses `#` to outline single rectangles and `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Scanning the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each unique rectangle, considering overlaps.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangle Corners**: \n   - A rectangle's top-left corner is identified by a `#` that is not preceded by another `#` on the same row or above it.\n   - A rectangle's bottom-right corner is identified by a `#` that is not followed by another `#` on the same row or below it.\n\n2. **Count Overlapping Rectangles**:\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by `█`. We need to ensure that these are counted as two separate rectangles.\n\n3. **Iterate through the Grid**:\n   - Traverse each row and column to identify the start and end of each rectangle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    # Function to check if a position is a top-left corner of a rectangle\n    def is_top_left(r, c):\n        if grid[r][c] != '#':\n            return False\n        if r > 0 and grid[r-1][c] == '#':\n            return False\n        if c > 0 and grid[r][c-1] == '#':\n            return False\n        return True\n\n    # Function to check if a position is a bottom-right corner of a rectangle\n    def is_bottom_right(r, c):\n        if grid[r][c] != '#':\n            return False\n        if r < rows - 1 and grid[r+1][c] == '#':\n            return False\n        if c < cols - 1 and grid[r][c+1] == '#':\n            return False\n        return True\n\n    # Traverse the grid to count rectangles\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if is_top_left(r, c):\n                rectangle_count += 1\n            if grid[r][c] == '█':\n                rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                                                              ############      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                     #########################################█####      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #                                        #   #      #      \",\n    \"                     #########################################█####      #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"                                                              #          #      \",\n    \"    ###########################################################          #      \",\n    \"    #                                                        ##
