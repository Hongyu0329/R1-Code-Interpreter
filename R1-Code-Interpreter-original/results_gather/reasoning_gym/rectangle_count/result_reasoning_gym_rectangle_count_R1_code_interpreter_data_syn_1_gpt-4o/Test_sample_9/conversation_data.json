    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid uses `#` to outline rectangles and `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. \n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangles**: We need to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of `#` or `█` characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count Overlapping Rectangles**: The `█` character indicates overlapping rectangles. We need to ensure that we count each rectangle only once, even if they overlap.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Traverse the grid to find the top-left corner of each rectangle.\n   - For each top-left corner, find the corresponding bottom-right corner by looking for the next `#` or `█` in the same row and column.\n   - Keep track of rectangles that have been counted to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    def mark_rectangle(r, c):\n        # Find the bottom-right corner of the rectangle\n        end_r, end_c = r, c\n        while end_c < cols and grid[r][end_c] in '#█':\n            end_c += 1\n        end_c -= 1\n        while end_r < rows and grid[end_r][c] in '#█':\n            end_r += 1\n        end_r -= 1\n\n        # Mark the rectangle as visited\n        for i in range(r, end_r + 1):\n            for j in range(c, end_c + 1):\n                visited[i][j] = True\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] in '#█' and not visited[i][j]:\n                mark_rectangle(i, j)\n                rectangle_count += 1\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"                               #############################################    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #                                           #    \",\n    \"                               #          #################                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                               #          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                   #############          #               #                #    \",\n    \"                   #          ##

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                               #############################################    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #          #################                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                   #############          #               #                #    \n                   #          ##
