    "To solve this problem, we need to identify and count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The rectangles are outlined with `#` and overlapping rectangles are shown with `█`. \n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangles**: We need to scan the grid to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of `#` or `█` characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count Rectangles**: Once we identify the corners, we can count how many distinct rectangles are present.\n\n3. **Handle Overlaps**: If there are overlapping rectangles, they will be represented by `█`. We need to ensure that these are counted correctly, considering the overlap.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    def is_corner(x, y):\n        # Check if the current position is a corner of a rectangle\n        if grid[x][y] not in ['#', '█']:\n            return False\n        # Check surrounding positions to determine if it's a corner\n        if (x > 0 and grid[x-1][y] in [' ', '#', '█']) and (y > 0 and grid[x][y-1] in [' ', '#', '█']):\n            return True\n        if (x < len(grid) - 1 and grid[x+1][y] in [' ', '#', '█']) and (y < len(grid[0]) - 1 and grid[x][y+1] in [' ', '#', '█']):\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    def find_rectangle(x, y):\n        # Find the bottom-right corner of the rectangle starting from (x, y)\n        max_x, max_y = x, y\n        while max_x < len(grid) and grid[max_x][y] in ['#', '█']:\n            max_x += 1\n        while max_y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][max_y] in ['#', '█']:\n            max_y += 1\n        return max_x -
