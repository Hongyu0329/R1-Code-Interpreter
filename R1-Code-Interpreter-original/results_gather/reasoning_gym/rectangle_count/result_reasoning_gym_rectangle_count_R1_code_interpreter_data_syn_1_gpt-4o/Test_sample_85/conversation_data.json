  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid. The grid uses `#` to outline single rectangles and `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. \n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify Rectangles**: We need to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of `#` or `█` characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count Overlapping Rectangles**: The `█` character indicates overlapping rectangles. We need to ensure that we count each rectangle only once, even if it overlaps with another.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Traverse the grid row by row.\n   - For each `#` or `█` found, attempt to trace the rectangle by moving right and down until the rectangle is fully outlined.\n   - Keep track of visited rectangles to avoid double counting.\n   - Count each unique rectangle found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    def is_rectangle(r, c):\n        return grid[r][c] == '#' or grid[r][c] == '█'\n\n    def mark_rectangle(r, c):\n        #
