Rectangles are defined by the '#' character, and overlapping rectangles are indicated by the '█' character. \n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Parsing the grid to identify the boundaries of each rectangle.\n2. Counting each unique rectangle, considering overlaps.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- We will iterate through each character in the grid.\n- When we encounter a '#', we will check if it is part of a new rectangle by looking at its surrounding characters.\n- When we encounter a '█', we will consider it as part of two overlapping rectangles.\n- We will keep track of the rectangles we have already counted to avoid double-counting.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to count the rectangles.\n\n```python\ndef count_rectangles(grid):\n    rows = grid.strip().split('\\n')\n    num_rows = len(rows)\n    num_cols = len(rows[0])\n    \n    visited = [[False] * num_cols for _ in range(num_rows)]\n    rectangle_count = 0\n\n    def is_new_rectangle(r, c):\n        # Check if this is a new rectangle by looking at the surrounding\n        # If the top and left are not part of a rectangle, it's a new one\n        if r > 0 and (rows[r-1][c] == '#' or rows[r-1][c] == '█'):\n            return False\n        if c > 0 and (rows[r][c-1] == '#' or rows[r][c-1] == '█'):\n            return False\n        return True\n\n    for r in range(num_rows):\n        for c in range(num_cols):\n            if rows[r][c] == '#' and not visited[r][c]:\n                if is_new_rectangle(r, c):\n                    rectangle_count += 1\n                # Mark the entire rectangle as visited\n                for i in range(r, num_rows):\n                    if rows[i][c] != '#' and rows[i][c] != '█':\n                        break\n                    for j in range(c, num_cols):\n                        if rows[i][j] != '#' and rows[i][j] != '█':\n                            break\n                        visited[i][j] = True\n            elif rows[r][c] == '█' and not visited[r][c]:\n                # '█' indicates overlap, count as two rectangles\n                rectangle_count += 2\n                # Mark the entire overlapping area as visited\n                for i in range(r, num_rows):\n                    if rows[i][c] != '█':\n                        break\n                    for j in range(c, num_cols):\n                        if rows[i][j] != '█':\n                            break\n                        visited[i][j] = True\n\n    return rectangle_count\n\n# The given ASCII grid\nascii_grid = \"\"\"\n                       #############                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                     ##█###########█########################################### \n                     # #           #                                          # \n                     # #           #                                          # \n                     ##█###########█########################################### \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #   #########################                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #   #############       #                \n                       #           #   #   #           #       #                \n                       #           #   #   #           #       #                \n                      #█#####      #   #   #           #       #                \n                      ##

How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                       #############                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                     ##█###########█########################################### \n                     # #           #                                          # \n                     # #           #                                          # \n                     ##█###########█########################################### \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #                                            \n                       #           #   #########################                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #                       #                \n                       #           #   #   #############       #                \n                       #           #   #   #           #       #                \n                       #           #   #   #           #       #                \n                      #█#####      #   #   #           #       #                \n                      ##
