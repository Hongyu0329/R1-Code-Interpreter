    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Start by scanning the grid from top to bottom and left to right to identify the outlines of rectangles.\n   - Look for continuous lines of `#` or `█` that form closed loops, which indicate the presence of a rectangle.\n\n2. **Analyze the Grid:**\n   - The first large rectangle is located towards the center of the grid. It is outlined entirely with `#` characters.\n   - This rectangle starts at the 31st row and extends down to the 61st row, and it spans from the 36th column to the 65th column.\n   - The dimensions of this rectangle are 30 rows by 30 columns.\n\n3. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The second rectangle is located towards the bottom of the grid. It is also outlined with `#` characters.\n   - This rectangle starts at the 66th row and extends down to the 68th row, and it spans from the 38th column to the 56th column.\n   - The dimensions of this rectangle are 3 rows by 19 columns.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - There are no overlapping rectangles in this grid, as indicated by the absence of `█` characters.\n   - Therefore, we have identified two distinct rectangles in the grid.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - The total number of rectangles in the grid is 2.\n\nBased on the analysis, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                       ##############################           \n                                       #
