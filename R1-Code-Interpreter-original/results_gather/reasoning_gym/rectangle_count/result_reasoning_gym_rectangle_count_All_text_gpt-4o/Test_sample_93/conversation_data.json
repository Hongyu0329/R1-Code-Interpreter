    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. These are the simplest to identify.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by the `█` character. Each `█` represents an overlap of two rectangles.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, identifying each rectangle by its corners and sides.\n   - For each `█`, ensure that it is counted as part of two rectangles.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The first rectangle is a vertical rectangle starting at row 10, column 39, and ending at row 19, column 41.\n   - The second rectangle is a large rectangle starting at row 20, column 24, and ending at row 34, column 41.\n   - The third rectangle is a large rectangle starting at row 35, column 24, and ending at row 69, column 41.\n   - The fourth rectangle is a large rectangle starting at row 35, column 42, and ending at row 69, column 78.\n   - The fifth rectangle is a large rectangle starting at row 70, column 24, and ending at row 70, column 78.\n\n5. **Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The overlap occurs at the `█` characters, which are at the intersections of the large rectangles. Each `█` indicates an overlap of two rectangles.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying all rectangles and considering overlaps, we count a total of 5 distinct rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
