    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#`. These are single rectangles.\n   - Count each distinct rectangle that is completely enclosed by `#`.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`.\n   - Each `█` can be part of two overlapping rectangles. We need to ensure that we count each rectangle only once.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line.\n   - For each rectangle, ensure that it is fully enclosed and not just a part of another larger rectangle.\n   - Keep track of rectangles that have already been counted to avoid double-counting.\n\n4. **Consider Edge Cases:**\n   - Ensure that rectangles that share edges or corners are counted separately if they are distinct.\n   - Check for any small rectangles that might be nested within larger ones.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - Sum up all the distinct rectangles identified in the grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- There is a large rectangle on the left side of the grid.\n- There is another large rectangle on the right side of the grid.\n- There are smaller rectangles within these larger rectangles, especially where `█` indicates overlaps.\n- Carefully count each distinct rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted correctly.\n\nAfter analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles is determined to be:\n\n<<<11>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                               #######                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #                          \n                                               #     #             #############\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #           #\n                                               #     #             #      ######\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                                               #     #             #      #   ##\n                ###############################█#####█####         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #      #   ##\n                #                              #     #   #         #######█###█#\n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   #                #   # \n                #                              #     #   ####             #   # \n                #                              #     #   ##
