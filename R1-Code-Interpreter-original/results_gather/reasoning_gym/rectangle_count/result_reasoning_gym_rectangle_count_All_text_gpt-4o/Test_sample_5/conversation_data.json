    "To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. These are straightforward to count as they are clearly defined by their borders.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by the `█` character. Each `█` represents a point where two rectangles overlap. We need to consider the surrounding `#` characters to determine the boundaries of each overlapping rectangle.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the start and end of rectangles.\n   - For each rectangle, ensure that it is fully enclosed by `#` or `█` characters.\n   - Keep track of rectangles that have already been counted to avoid double-counting.\n\n4. **Consider Edge Cases:**\n   - Ensure that rectangles that share a side or corner are counted separately.\n   - Verify that all rectangles are closed shapes with no missing sides.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the given grid:\n\n- **Top Left Rectangle:**\n  - A small rectangle at the top left, outlined by `#`.\n\n- **Large Rectangle:**\n  - A large rectangle that spans most of the grid, outlined by `#`.\n\n- **Overlapping Rectangles:**\n  - Several smaller rectangles overlap within the large rectangle, indicated by `█`. Each `█` represents an overlap of two rectangles.\n\n- **Bottom Right Rectangle:**\n  - A rectangle at the bottom right, outlined by `#`.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the grid and counting each distinct rectangle, including those that overlap, we find the total number of rectangles.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<14>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                     #####                      \n                                                     #   #                      \n                                                     #####                      \n           #################################################################### \n           #                                                                  # \n           #                                                                  # \n           #                                                                  # \n           #                                                     ########     # \n           #                                                     #      #     # \n           #                                                     #      #     # \n           #                                                     #      #     # \n           #                                                     #      #     # \n           #                                            #########█######█##   # \n           #                                            #        #      # #   # \n           #                                            #        #      # #   # \n           #                                            #        #      # #   # \n           #                                            #        #      # #   # \n           #                                          ##█########█##### # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #    # # #   # \n           #                                          # #        #####█## #   # \n           #                                          # #             #   #   # \n           #                                          # #             #   #   # \n           #                                          # #             #   #   # \n           #                                          # #             #   #   # \n           #                                          # #             #   #   # \n           #                                          # #             #   #   # \n   ########█###################################       # #             #   #   # \n   #       #                                  #       # #            #█###██##█#\n   #       #                                  #       # #            ##
