    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. These are straightforward to count.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`. These areas can be part of two overlapping rectangles. We need to ensure that we count each rectangle only once.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the start and end of rectangles.\n   - For each rectangle, ensure that it is fully enclosed by `#` or `█` on all sides.\n   - Keep track of rectangles that have already been counted to avoid double-counting.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The first large rectangle is located towards the top of the grid, spanning multiple lines and fully enclosed by `#`.\n   - The second rectangle is smaller and located towards the bottom right of the grid.\n   - The third rectangle is located towards the middle of the grid, overlapping with another rectangle, indicated by `█`.\n   - The fourth rectangle is the one overlapping with the third rectangle, sharing the `█` boundary.\n   - The fifth rectangle is located at the bottom of the grid, fully enclosed by `#`.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting each distinct rectangle, we sum up the total number of rectangles.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is: <<<5>>>"

Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                      ##########################\n                                                      #
