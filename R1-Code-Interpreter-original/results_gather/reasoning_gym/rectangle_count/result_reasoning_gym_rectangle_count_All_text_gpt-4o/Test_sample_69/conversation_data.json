    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangles:**\n   - The largest rectangle is the outermost one, which is outlined with `#` and spans almost the entire grid. This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Inside the largest rectangle, there are smaller rectangles that overlap with each other. These overlaps are indicated by the `█` character.\n   - We need to carefully trace each rectangle, ensuring we account for overlaps correctly.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top and move downwards, identifying each rectangle by its corners and sides.\n   - For each `#` or `█` that forms a closed loop, count it as a rectangle.\n   - Pay special attention to areas where `█` indicates overlapping rectangles, ensuring each distinct rectangle is counted only once.\n\n4. **List of Rectangles:**\n   - The outermost rectangle.\n   - The smaller rectangle inside the outer rectangle, which overlaps with another rectangle.\n   - Additional rectangles formed by the overlapping sections.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting each distinct rectangle, sum them up to get the total number of rectangles.\n\nBy following these steps, we can ensure that we accurately count all the rectangles in the grid, including those that overlap.\n\nThe total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<9>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                          ###############################       \n                                          #                             #       \n                                          #                             #       \n                                          #                             #       \n                                          #                             #       \n                                      ####█###########                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #                  #       \n                                      #   #          #              ####█###    \n                                      #   #          #              #   #  #    \n                                      #   #          #              #   #  #    \n      ################################█###█##########█##############█###█  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   #          #              #   █  #    \n      #                               #   ###########█##############█###█  #    \n      #                               #              #              #   #  #    \n      #                 ##############█##############█#######       #   #  #    \n      #                 #             #              #      #       #   #  #    \n      #                 #             #              #      #       #   #  #    \n      #                 #         ####█##############█######█#      #   #  #    \n      #                 #         #   #              #      ##
