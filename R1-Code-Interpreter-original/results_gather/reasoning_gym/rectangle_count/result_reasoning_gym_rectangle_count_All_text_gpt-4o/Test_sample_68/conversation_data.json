    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the presence of `#` or `█` characters that form the outline of rectangles.\n   - A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of `#` or `█` characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - **First Rectangle:** \n     - Located towards the right side of the grid, starting at line 14 and ending at line 23. It is a large rectangle outlined entirely with `#`.\n   - **Second Rectangle:**\n     - Overlaps with the first rectangle, starting at line 24 and ending at line 33. It is a smaller rectangle inside the first one, with the top and bottom edges marked by `█`.\n   - **Third Rectangle:**\n     - Located towards the left side of the grid, starting at line 34 and ending at line 63. It is a large rectangle outlined with `#`, with the top and bottom edges marked by `█`.\n\n3. **Consider Overlaps:**\n   - The grid allows for a maximum of two overlapping rectangles, indicated by the `█` character. In this grid, the overlap occurs between the first and second rectangles, and between the first and third rectangles.\n\n4. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting each distinct rectangle, we conclude that there are three rectangles in total.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                ############### \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                                #             # \n                                                          ######█##########   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     #         #   # \n                                                          #     ##########█#### \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                          #               #     \n                                                  ########█###############█#    \n                                                  #       #               ##
