    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. These are straightforward to count as they are clearly defined by the `#` characters.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character. Each `█` represents a point where two rectangles overlap. We need to consider these overlaps to ensure we count each rectangle only once.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the start and end of rectangles.\n   - For each rectangle, ensure that it is fully enclosed by `#` or `█` characters.\n   - Keep track of rectangles that have already been counted to avoid double-counting, especially in areas with overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid contains several distinct areas where rectangles are present. We will analyze each area separately.\n\n5. **Area Analysis:**\n   - **Top Left Area:** \n     - A large rectangle outlined by `#` from row 31 to row 43, column 15 to column 43.\n     - Inside this large rectangle, there is a smaller rectangle from row 35 to row 43, column 27 to column 37.\n   - **Middle Right Area:**\n     - A vertical rectangle from row 31 to row 40, column 74 to column 76.\n   - **Bottom Right Area:**\n     - A horizontal rectangle from row 55 to row 58, column 65 to column 77.\n   - **Bottom Left Area:**\n     - A large rectangle from row 63 to row 65, column 23 to column 77.\n\n6. **Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The `█` character appears in the middle of the grid, indicating overlapping rectangles. Specifically, there are two overlapping rectangles:\n     - One from row 35 to row 43, column 27 to column 37.\n     - Another from row 47 to row 55, column 27 to column 37.\n\n7. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying all distinct rectangles and accounting for overlaps, we count a total of 6 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<6>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                          ###   \n                                                                          #
