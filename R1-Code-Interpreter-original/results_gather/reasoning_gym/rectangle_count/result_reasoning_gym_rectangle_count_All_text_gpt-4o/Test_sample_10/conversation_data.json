    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the First Rectangle:**\n   - The first rectangle is located towards the center of the grid.\n   - It is outlined with `#` characters.\n   - The rectangle starts at the 13th row and extends to the 26th row vertically.\n   - Horizontally, it spans from the 17th column to the 68th column.\n   - This is a single rectangle with no overlaps.\n\n2. **Identify the Second Rectangle:**\n   - The second rectangle is located towards the bottom left of the grid.\n   - It is also outlined with `#` characters.\n   - The rectangle starts at the 30th row and extends to the 46th row vertically.\n   - Horizontally, it spans from the 4th column to the 41st column.\n   - This is another single rectangle with no overlaps.\n\n3. **Check for Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The problem statement mentions that overlapping rectangles (maximum 2) are shown with `█`.\n   - In the provided grid, there are no `█` characters, indicating that there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified two distinct rectangles in the grid.\n   - There are no overlapping rectangles to consider.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - The total number of rectangles in the grid is 2.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                 ##################################################             \n                 #
