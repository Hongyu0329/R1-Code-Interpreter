    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. These are straightforward to count.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by the `█` character. Each `█` represents an overlap of two rectangles.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - For each distinct rectangle, whether single or overlapping, count it as one.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the grid:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Vertical Rectangle on the Right:**\n   - There is a tall vertical rectangle on the right side of the grid, outlined with `#`. This is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Overlapping Rectangles in the Middle:**\n   - In the middle of the grid, there are two overlapping rectangles. The overlap is indicated by the `█` characters. \n   - The first rectangle is the larger one that spans horizontally and vertically, outlined with `#`.\n   - The second rectangle overlaps with the first one, creating the `█` characters.\n\n3. **Large Rectangle at the Bottom:**\n   - At the bottom of the grid, there is a large rectangle outlined with `#`. This is a single rectangle.\n\n4. **Smaller Rectangle Inside the Large Rectangle:**\n   - Inside the large rectangle at the bottom, there is a smaller rectangle outlined with `#`.\n\n### Counting the Rectangles:\n\n- **Vertical Rectangle on the Right:** 1 rectangle\n- **Overlapping Rectangles in the Middle:** 2 rectangles (one large, one overlapping)\n- **Large Rectangle at the Bottom:** 1 rectangle\n- **Smaller Rectangle Inside the Large Rectangle:** 1 rectangle\n\nAdding these up gives us a total of 5 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
