    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the First Rectangle:**\n   - The first rectangle is the large one that spans most of the grid. It is outlined with `#` characters.\n   - It starts at the fourth row and extends downwards, covering a large portion of the grid.\n   - This rectangle is clearly defined and does not overlap with any other rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Second Rectangle:**\n   - The second rectangle is located towards the bottom of the grid.\n   - It is a smaller rectangle, also outlined with `#` characters.\n   - It starts at a lower position in the grid and is completely separate from the first rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify the Third Rectangle:**\n   - The third rectangle is located towards the bottom right of the grid.\n   - It is another small rectangle, outlined with `#` characters.\n   - It is distinct and does not overlap with the other two rectangles.\n\n4. **Check for Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - According to the problem statement, overlapping rectangles would be shown with `█` characters.\n   - In this grid, there are no `█` characters, indicating that there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n5. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified three distinct rectangles in the grid.\n   - There are no overlapping rectangles, so the total count remains three.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>"
