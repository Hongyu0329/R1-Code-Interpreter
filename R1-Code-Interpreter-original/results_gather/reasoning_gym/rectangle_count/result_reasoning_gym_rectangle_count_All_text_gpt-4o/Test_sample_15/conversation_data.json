    "To determine the total number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - The first rectangle is the large one on the left side of the grid, outlined entirely with `#`.\n   - The second rectangle is the large one on the right side of the grid, also outlined with `#`.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The overlapping area is indicated by `█`. This suggests that there are two rectangles overlapping in this region.\n   - The overlapping area is located towards the bottom right of the grid.\n\n3. **Count the Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The overlapping area is part of a rectangle that extends from the bottom right corner upwards, overlapping with the large rectangle on the right.\n   - The overlapping rectangle is outlined by `#` and `█`, indicating that it shares part of its boundary with the large rectangle on the right.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - We have identified three distinct rectangles:\n     1. The large rectangle on the left.\n     2. The large rectangle on the right.\n     3. The smaller rectangle overlapping with the large rectangle on the right.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n   ################                                                             \n   #              #                                                             \n   #              #                                                             \n   #              #                                                             \n   #              #                                                             \n   #              #                              ###############                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #                \n   #              #                              #             #         #####  \n   #              #                              #             #         #   #  \n   #              #                              #             #         #   #  \n   ################                              #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #             #         #   #  \n                                                 #           ##█         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █         #   #  \n                                                 #           # █ #########   #  \n                                                 #           # █ #      ##
