    "To determine the total number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. The grid uses two symbols to represent rectangles: `#` for single rectangles and `█` for overlapping rectangles. \n\nLet's break down the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for closed loops of `#` that form rectangles. These are straightforward to identify as they are not intersected by any `█`.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The `█` symbol indicates overlapping rectangles. We need to consider each `█` as a potential intersection point of two rectangles.\n   - For each `█`, determine the possible rectangles that could overlap at that point. This involves checking the surrounding `#` symbols to see if they form closed loops with the `█` as part of the boundary.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Count each distinct rectangle identified in the grid, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the grid:\n\n- **Top Section:**\n  - There is a large rectangle outlined by `#` starting at row 9, column 49, and ending at row 12, column 62.\n  \n- **Middle Section:**\n  - A large rectangle starts at row 13, column 39, and ends at row 28, column 62. This rectangle overlaps with another rectangle starting at row 13, column 39, and ending at row 28, column 49, creating a shared boundary with `█`.\n  - Another rectangle starts at row 13, column 50, and ends at row 28, column 62, overlapping with the previous rectangle.\n\n- **Bottom Section:**\n  - A large rectangle starts at row 29, column 8, and ends at row 48, column 62. This rectangle overlaps with another rectangle starting at row 29, column 8, and ending at row 48, column 39, creating a shared boundary with `█`.\n  - Another rectangle starts at row 29, column 40, and ends at row 48, column 62, overlapping with the previous rectangle.\n  - A smaller rectangle starts at row 29, column 8, and ends at row 48, column 19, overlapping with the previous two rectangles.\n\n- **Right Section:**\n  - A small rectangle starts at row 22, column 70, and ends at row 48, column 75.\n\n- **Bottom Right Section:**\n  - A small rectangle starts at row 49, column 8, and ends at row 56, column 19.\n\nAfter identifying and counting all distinct rectangles, we find that there are a total of 9 rectangles in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<9>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                 ##############                 \n                                                 #            #                 \n                                                 #            #                 \n                                                 #            #                 \n                                       ##########█############█                 \n                                       #         #            █                 \n                                       #         #            █                 \n                                       #         #            █                 \n                                       #         #            █                 \n                                       #         #            █                 \n                                       #         #            █                 \n                                       #         #            █                 \n                                       #         #            █                 \n       ################################█#########█#########   █                 \n       #                               #         #        #   █                 \n       #                               #         #        #   █                 \n       #                               #         #        #   █                 \n       #                               #         #        #   █           ##### \n       #                               #         #        #   █           #   # \n       #                               #         #        #   █           #   # \n       #                               #         #        #   █           #   # \n       #                               #     #####        #   █           #   # \n       #                               #     #  ##
