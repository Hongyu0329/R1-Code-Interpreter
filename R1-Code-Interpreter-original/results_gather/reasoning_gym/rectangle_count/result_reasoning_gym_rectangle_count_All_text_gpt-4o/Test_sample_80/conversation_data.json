    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles that are outlined with `#` and do not overlap with any other rectangle. \n   - The first rectangle is located at the top left of the grid:\n     ```\n     ###########\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     #         #\n     ###########\n     ```\n   - The second rectangle is located towards the right of the grid:\n     ```\n     ############################\n     #                          #\n     #                          #\n     ############################\n     ```\n   - The third rectangle is located towards the bottom right of the grid:\n     ```\n     #########################\n     #                       #\n     #                       #\n     #                       #\n     #                       #\n     #                       #\n     #                       #\n     #                       #\n     #                       #\n     #                       #\n     #########################\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`.\n   - The overlapping area is located in the middle of the grid:\n     ```\n     #############█############\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #            #           #\n     #############█############\n     ```\n   - This overlapping area indicates two rectangles overlapping. The first rectangle is the one that overlaps with the previously identified rectangle on the right, and the second rectangle is the one that overlaps with the previously identified rectangle on the bottom.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified three single rectangles.\n   - We have identified two overlapping rectangles, which count as two additional rectangles.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total:**\n   - Total rectangles = 3 (single) + 2 (overlapping) = 5\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n  ###########                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                          ############################             \n  #         #                          #                          #             \n  #         #                          #                          #             \n  #         #                          ############################             \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                                                                   \n  #         #                    #########################                      \n  #         #                    #                       #                      \n  #         #                    #                       #                      \n  #         #                    #                       #                      \n  #         #       #############█############           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  #         #       #            #           #           #                      \n  ###########       #            #           #           #                      \n                    #            #           #           #                      \n                    #            ############█############                      \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #                                  \n                    #                        #            ###                   \n                    #                        #            # #                   \n                    #                       #█############█#█############       \n                    #                       ##
