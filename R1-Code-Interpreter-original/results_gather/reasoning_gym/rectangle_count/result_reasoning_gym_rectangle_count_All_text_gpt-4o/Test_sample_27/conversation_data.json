    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Look for closed loops of `#` or `█` that form rectangles.\n   - Rectangles can be formed by `#` alone or by `█` which indicates overlapping rectangles.\n\n2. **Analyze the Grid:**\n   - The grid is divided into three main sections: the top section, the middle section, and the bottom section.\n\n3. **Top Section:**\n   - There is a small rectangle at the very top made entirely of `#`.\n   - Below it, there is a large rectangle outlined by `#` and `█`. The `█` indicates an overlap, suggesting two rectangles are present here.\n\n4. **Middle Section:**\n   - The middle section is a long vertical rectangle made entirely of `#`.\n\n5. **Bottom Section:**\n   - There is a smaller rectangle on the right side, made entirely of `#`.\n   - On the left side, there is a large rectangle outlined by `#` and `█`. The `█` indicates an overlap, suggesting two rectangles are present here.\n\n6. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Top Section: 1 small rectangle + 2 overlapping rectangles = 3 rectangles.\n   - Middle Section: 1 rectangle.\n   - Bottom Section: 1 small rectangle + 2 overlapping rectangles = 3 rectangles.\n\n7. **Total Count:**\n   - Add up all the rectangles from each section: 3 (top) + 1 (middle) + 3 (bottom) = 7 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
