    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The entire grid is surrounded by a rectangle made of `#` characters. This is the largest rectangle and counts as one.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The grid contains overlapping rectangles, indicated by the `█` character. We need to identify these overlapping sections and count the rectangles they form.\n\n3. **Analyze the Overlapping Sections:**\n   - There are two main overlapping sections in the grid:\n     - The first overlap occurs towards the bottom right of the grid, where two rectangles intersect.\n     - The second overlap is slightly above the first, where another set of rectangles intersect.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The first overlap (bottom right) involves two rectangles:\n     - One rectangle is the vertical section that extends from the bottom to the top of the overlap.\n     - The other rectangle is the horizontal section that extends from the left to the right of the overlap.\n   - The second overlap (above the first) also involves two rectangles:\n     - One rectangle is the vertical section that extends from the bottom to the top of the overlap.\n     - The other rectangle is the horizontal section that extends from the left to the right of the overlap.\n\n5. **Total Count:**\n   - The outer rectangle counts as 1.\n   - The first overlap involves 2 rectangles.\n   - The second overlap involves 2 rectangles.\n   - Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 1 (outer) + 2 (first overlap) + 2 (second overlap) = 5.\n\nThus, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
