    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify the distinct rectangles based on the characters used to outline them. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Characters:**\n   - The grid uses two types of characters to outline rectangles: `#` and `█`.\n   - `#` is used to outline single rectangles.\n   - `█` is used to indicate overlapping rectangles, but in this grid, there are no `█` characters present.\n\n2. **Locate the Rectangles:**\n   - We need to scan the grid to find any continuous lines of `#` that form closed shapes, which are rectangles.\n   - Starting from the top of the grid, we notice a rectangle outlined by `#` starting at row 53 and ending at row 66.\n\n3. **Analyze the Rectangle:**\n   - The rectangle starts at column 36 and ends at column 49.\n   - It is a single rectangle, as there are no `█` characters indicating overlap with another rectangle.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Since there is only one rectangle outlined by `#` and no overlapping rectangles indicated by `█`, the total count of rectangles is 1.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The total number of rectangles in the grid is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
