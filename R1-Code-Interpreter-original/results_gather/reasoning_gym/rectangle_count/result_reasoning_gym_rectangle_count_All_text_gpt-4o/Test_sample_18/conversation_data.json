    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Single rectangles are outlined with the character `#`.\n   - We need to look for closed loops of `#` that form a rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the character `█`.\n   - Each `█` represents a point where two rectangles overlap.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for closed loops of `#` and `█`.\n   - For each closed loop, determine if it is a single rectangle or part of overlapping rectangles.\n   - Keep track of all unique rectangles found.\n\n4. **Consider Overlaps:**\n   - When encountering `█`, ensure to count both overlapping rectangles separately.\n   - Verify that each rectangle is counted only once.\n\n5. **Verify Completeness:**\n   - Double-check the grid to ensure no rectangles are missed.\n   - Ensure that all overlapping rectangles are accounted for.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately count the number of rectangles in the grid. After analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles is determined to be:\n\n<<<11>>>"
