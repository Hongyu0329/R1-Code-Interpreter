    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with the '#' character. These are non-overlapping rectangles.\n   - In the grid, there is a large rectangle on the left side, outlined with '#'. This is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by the '█' character.\n   - In the grid, there is a section on the right side where two rectangles overlap. The overlapping area is marked with '█'.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The large rectangle on the left is one rectangle.\n   - On the right side, there are two overlapping rectangles. The overlapping area is marked with '█', indicating two rectangles are present in that section.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - Add the single rectangle on the left (1) to the two overlapping rectangles on the right (2).\n   - Total rectangles = 1 (left) + 2 (right) = 3.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                    ####███#    \n                                                                    #   # ##
