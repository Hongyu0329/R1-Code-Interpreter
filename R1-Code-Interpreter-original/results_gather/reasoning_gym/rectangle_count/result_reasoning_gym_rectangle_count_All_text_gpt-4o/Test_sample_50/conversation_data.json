    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Start by identifying the outermost rectangle. This is the largest rectangle that encompasses the entire structure. It is outlined by the '#' characters and spans from the top to the bottom of the grid.\n   - Next, look for any overlapping rectangles. These are indicated by the '█' character, which signifies the overlap of two rectangles.\n\n2. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The first rectangle is the large outer rectangle that spans the entire grid vertically and horizontally.\n   - The second rectangle is the smaller rectangle that overlaps with the outer rectangle. This is indicated by the '█' character in the middle of the grid.\n   - The third rectangle is the smaller rectangle at the bottom of the grid, which is also outlined by '#' characters.\n\n3. **Consider Overlaps:**\n   - The '█' character indicates an overlap between two rectangles. In this grid, there are two '█' characters, suggesting that two rectangles overlap with the large outer rectangle.\n\n4. **Final Count:**\n   - Total rectangles identified: 3\n     - 1 large outer rectangle\n     - 1 smaller overlapping rectangle\n     - 1 smaller rectangle at the bottom\n\nBy carefully analyzing the grid and considering the overlaps, we can conclude the total number of rectangles present.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is <<<3>>>."

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                              ############      \n                                                              #
