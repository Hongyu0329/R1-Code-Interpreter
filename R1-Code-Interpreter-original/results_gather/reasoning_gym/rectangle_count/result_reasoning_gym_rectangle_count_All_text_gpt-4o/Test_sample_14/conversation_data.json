    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Look for continuous lines of `#` characters that form closed loops, which represent the boundaries of rectangles.\n\n2. **Examine the Grid:**\n   - The grid is mostly empty, except for two distinct areas where `#` characters form rectangles.\n\n3. **First Rectangle:**\n   - Located towards the center of the grid, there is a large rectangle formed by `#` characters.\n   - This rectangle is defined by the following coordinates:\n     - Top-left corner: (row 58, column 29)\n     - Bottom-right corner: (row 61, column 75)\n   - This forms a single large rectangle.\n\n4. **Second Rectangle:**\n   - Located towards the bottom right of the grid, there is a smaller rectangle.\n   - This rectangle is defined by the following coordinates:\n     - Top-left corner: (row 66, column 51)\n     - Bottom-right corner: (row 69, column 54)\n   - This forms a second, smaller rectangle.\n\n5. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified two distinct rectangles in the grid.\n\n6. **Consider Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The problem statement mentions overlapping rectangles are shown with `█`, but there are no `█` characters in the grid, indicating no overlapping rectangles.\n\n7. **Final Count:**\n   - Since there are no overlapping rectangles, the total count of rectangles is simply the sum of the distinct rectangles identified.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"
