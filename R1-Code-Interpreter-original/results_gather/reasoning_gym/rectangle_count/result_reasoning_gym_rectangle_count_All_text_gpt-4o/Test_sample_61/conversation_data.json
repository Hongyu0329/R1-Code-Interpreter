    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Single rectangles are outlined with `#`.\n   - We need to look for closed loops of `#` that form rectangles.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by `█`.\n   - We need to identify areas where `█` is present and determine how many rectangles overlap in those areas.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - For each distinct closed loop of `#`, count it as one rectangle.\n   - For each area of `█`, determine if it represents one or two overlapping rectangles and count accordingly.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for `#` and `█`.\n   - Trace the boundaries of each rectangle, ensuring that each is counted only once.\n   - Pay special attention to areas with `█` to determine if they represent overlapping rectangles.\n\n5. **Detailed Examination:**\n   - The large rectangle at the top is a single rectangle.\n   - The area with `█` in the middle of the grid indicates overlapping rectangles.\n   - The smaller rectangles within the large rectangle need to be identified and counted.\n   - The bottom right corner contains a small rectangle.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting all rectangles, sum them up to get the total number.\n\nBy following these steps, we can ensure that all rectangles, including overlapping ones, are accurately counted.\n\nAfter analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
