    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Single rectangles are outlined with `#`.\n   - We need to look for closed loops of `#` that form a rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by `█`.\n   - Each `█` can be part of two overlapping rectangles.\n\n3. **Scan the Grid:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move row by row.\n   - For each row, look for sequences of `#` and `█` that form the top or bottom of a rectangle.\n   - Track vertical sequences of `#` and `█` to identify the sides of rectangles.\n\n4. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - For each complete rectangle identified, increment the count.\n   - Ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\n5. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - The large rectangle at the top is a single rectangle.\n   - The smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle on the left is another single rectangle.\n   - The overlapping area in the middle, indicated by `█`, suggests two overlapping rectangles.\n   - The vertical sequence of `#` and `█` on the right forms another rectangle.\n   - The bottom section with `█` and `#` forms another overlapping set of rectangles.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying all distinct rectangles, sum them up to get the total count.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is: <<<8>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                    #######################################     \n                                    #
