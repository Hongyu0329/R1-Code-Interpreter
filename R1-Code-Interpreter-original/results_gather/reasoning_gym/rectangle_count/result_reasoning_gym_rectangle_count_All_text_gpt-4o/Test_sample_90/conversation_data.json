    "To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. \n   - The first rectangle is located at the top left of the grid, spanning from the first to the last `#` in the first row and extending downwards until the last `#` in the same column.\n   - The second rectangle is located to the right of the first rectangle, starting from the first `#` in the row where the first rectangle ends and extending to the rightmost `#` in the same row, and extending downwards until the last `#` in the same column.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character.\n   - The overlapping section is located towards the bottom of the grid, where the `█` characters appear.\n   - The overlapping section is part of two rectangles: one that extends from the leftmost `#` to the rightmost `#` in the row containing the `█`, and another that extends from the topmost `#` to the bottommost `#` in the column containing the `█`.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Count each distinct rectangle identified in the steps above.\n   - Ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted separately, even though they share some common boundaries.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Double-check each identified rectangle to ensure no additional rectangles are missed.\n   - Verify that each rectangle is counted only once, except for overlapping rectangles which are counted as separate entities.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<4>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n          #####                                                                 \n          #   #                                                                 \n          #   #                                                                 \n          #   #                                                                 \n          #   #                     ##########################                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #   #                     #                        #                  \n          #####                     #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                                    #                        #                  \n                    #######██#######█########################█######            \n                    #      ##
