    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The entire grid is enclosed by a large rectangle formed by `#` characters. This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The grid contains areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by the `█` character. We need to identify these overlapping rectangles separately.\n\n3. **Analyze the Overlapping Section:**\n   - There is a section in the grid where multiple rectangles overlap. This section is located towards the bottom of the grid, where the `█` characters are present.\n   - We need to count each distinct rectangle that contributes to this overlapping section.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The large outer rectangle is one.\n   - Within the overlapping section, there are several smaller rectangles. We need to count each of these:\n     - There is a smaller rectangle on the right side, outlined by `#` and overlapping with the larger structure.\n     - There are two vertical rectangles on the left side, which overlap with the horizontal structure.\n     - There is a horizontal rectangle at the bottom, which overlaps with the vertical structures.\n\n5. **Total Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting all distinct rectangles, including the overlapping ones, we sum them up to get the total count.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the grid and counting each distinct rectangle, we arrive at the total number of rectangles present in the grid.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<6>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n ######################################################################         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                                                    #         \n #                                         ######                     #         \n #                                         #    #                     #         \n #                                         #    #                     #         \n #               ##########################█####█#########            #         \n #               #      ###################█#####        #            #         \n #               #      #                  #   ##
