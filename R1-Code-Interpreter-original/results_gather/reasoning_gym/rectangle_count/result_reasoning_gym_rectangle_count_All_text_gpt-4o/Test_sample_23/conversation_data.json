    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The outer rectangle is clearly defined by the continuous line of `#` characters.\n   - It starts at the 23rd row and extends to the 70th row vertically.\n   - Horizontally, it spans from the 24th column to the 47th column.\n   - This is one complete rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Inner Rectangle:**\n   - Inside the outer rectangle, there is another smaller rectangle.\n   - This inner rectangle is also outlined by `#` characters.\n   - It starts at the 51st row and extends to the 58th row vertically.\n   - Horizontally, it spans from the 26th column to the 37th column.\n   - This is the second complete rectangle.\n\n3. **Check for Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The problem statement mentions that overlapping rectangles (up to 2) are shown with `█`.\n   - In this grid, there are no `█` characters, indicating that there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified two distinct rectangles: the outer rectangle and the inner rectangle.\n   - There are no overlapping rectangles, so the total count remains two.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"
