    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#`. These are non-overlapping rectangles.\n   - Count each distinct rectangle that is completely enclosed by `#`.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`.\n   - Each `█` can be part of two overlapping rectangles. We need to ensure that we count each rectangle only once.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move row by row.\n   - For each row, identify the start and end of a rectangle by finding continuous sequences of `#` or `█`.\n   - For overlapping areas, ensure that each rectangle is counted only once by checking the surrounding context.\n\n4. **Verify and Cross-Check:**\n   - After identifying all rectangles, cross-check to ensure no rectangle is counted twice.\n   - Verify that all `█` are accounted for in overlapping rectangles.\n\n5. **Summarize the Count:**\n   - Add up the total number of single and overlapping rectangles.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately count the number of rectangles in the grid. After analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles is determined to be:\n\n<<<16>>>"
