    "To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Borders**: Rectangles are defined by their borders, which are represented by `#` for single rectangles and `█` for overlapping rectangles. We need to trace these borders to identify distinct rectangles.\n\n2. **Scan the Grid**: Start from the top-left corner and scan the grid row by row, looking for the start of a rectangle, which is indicated by a `#` or `█`.\n\n3. **Trace Each Rectangle**: Once a starting point is found, trace the rectangle by following the `#` or `█` characters until the rectangle is fully outlined. This involves moving right until the end of the top border is reached, then moving down along the right border, moving left along the bottom border, and finally moving up along the left border back to the starting point.\n\n4. **Account for Overlaps**: If a `█` is encountered, it indicates an overlap of two rectangles. In such cases, ensure that both rectangles are counted separately.\n\n5. **Mark and Count**: As each rectangle is identified, mark it as counted to avoid double-counting. Keep a tally of the total number of rectangles identified.\n\n6. **Continue Scanning**: Continue scanning the grid until all rows and columns have been checked.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Large Outer Rectangle**: There is a large rectangle that spans almost the entire grid, outlined by `#` from the top-left to the bottom-right. This is the first rectangle.\n\n- **Vertical Rectangle on the Right**: There is a vertical rectangle on the right side of the grid, starting from the top and extending downwards, outlined by `#`. This is the second rectangle.\n\n- **Horizontal Rectangle at the Top**: There is a horizontal rectangle at the top of the grid, outlined by `#`, which is the third rectangle.\n\n- **Overlapping Rectangles**: There are several areas where `█` indicates overlapping rectangles. Each `█` represents the intersection of two rectangles. For each `█`, ensure that both contributing rectangles are counted.\n\n- **Inner Rectangles**: Within the large outer rectangle, there are several smaller rectangles, each outlined by `#`. These need to be identified and counted individually.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the grid and accounting for all rectangles, including overlaps, the total count of rectangles is determined.\n\nThe final count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
