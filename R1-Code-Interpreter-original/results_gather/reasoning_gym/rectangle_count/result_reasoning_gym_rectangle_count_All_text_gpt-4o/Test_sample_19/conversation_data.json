    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the presence of rectangle outlines.\n   - Look for horizontal and vertical lines made of '#' or '█' that form closed loops, indicating the presence of a rectangle.\n\n2. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - As you identify each rectangle, keep a count. \n   - Pay attention to overlapping rectangles, which are indicated by '█'. These should be counted as separate rectangles if they form distinct closed loops.\n\n3. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - **First Rectangle:** \n     - Located towards the right side of the grid, starting at row 20 and ending at row 31. It is a large rectangle outlined with '#'.\n   - **Second Rectangle:**\n     - Overlaps with the first rectangle, starting at row 32 and ending at row 43. It is also outlined with '#'.\n   - **Third Rectangle:**\n     - A smaller rectangle located at the bottom right, starting at row 44 and ending at row 54. It is outlined with '#'.\n   - **Fourth Rectangle:**\n     - Overlaps with the third rectangle, starting at row 55 and ending at row 65. It is outlined with '█' and '#'.\n   - **Fifth Rectangle:**\n     - A small rectangle at the bottom left, starting at row 66 and ending at row 76. It is outlined with '#'.\n\n4. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting all distinct rectangles, we find a total of 5 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                ###########     \n                                                                #
