    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Large Rectangles:**\n   - There is a large rectangle in the upper part of the grid, outlined with `#`. This rectangle spans from the top to the bottom of the grid, with a break in the middle where another rectangle overlaps.\n   - There is another large rectangle in the lower part of the grid, also outlined with `#`. This rectangle is separate from the first one and is located towards the bottom left of the grid.\n\n2. **Identify the Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - In the middle of the grid, there is a smaller rectangle that overlaps with the large rectangle. This overlap is indicated by the `█` character. This smaller rectangle is completely enclosed within the larger rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify the Rectangles in the Bottom Right:**\n   - There is a smaller rectangle towards the bottom right of the grid, outlined with `#`. This rectangle is separate from the others and does not overlap with any other rectangle.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The large rectangle in the upper part of the grid counts as one rectangle.\n   - The smaller rectangle that overlaps with the large rectangle in the middle counts as a second rectangle.\n   - The large rectangle in the lower part of the grid counts as a third rectangle.\n   - The smaller rectangle towards the bottom right counts as a fourth rectangle.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the grid, we can conclude that there are a total of four rectangles present.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
