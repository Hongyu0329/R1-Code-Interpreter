    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify the distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid Area**: The grid is mostly empty except for a section towards the bottom right where there are visible characters forming rectangles.\n\n2. **Locate the Rectangles**: \n   - The grid contains a single rectangle outlined with the character `#`.\n   - The rectangle is located towards the bottom of the grid, starting at a certain row and column and extending for a certain number of rows and columns.\n\n3. **Analyze the Rectangle**:\n   - The rectangle is formed by a continuous line of `#` characters.\n   - It has a top and bottom border, each consisting of 21 `#` characters.\n   - The left and right borders are each 3 `#` characters high, connecting the top and bottom borders.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles**:\n   - There is only one distinct rectangle visible in the grid.\n   - There are no overlapping rectangles indicated by the character `█`.\n\n5. **Final Count**:\n   - Since there is only one rectangle, the total count of rectangles is 1.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
