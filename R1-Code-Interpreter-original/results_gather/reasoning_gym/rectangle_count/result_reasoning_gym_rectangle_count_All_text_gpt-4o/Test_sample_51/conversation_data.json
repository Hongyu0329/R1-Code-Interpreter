  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#`. These are non-overlapping rectangles.\n   - Count each distinct rectangle that is fully enclosed by `#`.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`.\n   - Each `█` represents an overlap of two rectangles. We need to ensure that we count both rectangles contributing to the overlap.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the start and end of rectangles.\n   - For each rectangle found, ensure it is counted only once unless it overlaps with another, in which case both contributing rectangles should be counted.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The first rectangle starts at line 11 and ends at line 18, spanning horizontally from column 22 to column 45.\n   - The second rectangle starts at line 19 and ends at line 30, spanning horizontally from column 46 to column 50.\n   - The third rectangle starts at line 31 and ends at line 33, spanning horizontally from column 30 to column 50.\n   -

    "\nAnalyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points. Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.
