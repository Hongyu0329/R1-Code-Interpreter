    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Start by identifying the outermost rectangles and then move inward to find any overlapping or nested rectangles.\n   - Look for continuous lines of `#` or `█` that form closed loops, which indicate the boundaries of rectangles.\n\n2. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Begin with the largest rectangle and count it.\n   - Check for any overlapping rectangles, which are indicated by the `█` character.\n   - Ensure that each rectangle is counted only once, even if it shares sides with another rectangle.\n\n3. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid has a large outer rectangle that is clearly visible.\n   - Inside this large rectangle, there are two overlapping rectangles, as indicated by the `█` character.\n   - There is a smaller rectangle nested within the overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **Detailed Counting:**\n   - The large outer rectangle is one.\n   - The two overlapping rectangles are counted as two separate rectangles.\n   - The smaller rectangle inside the overlapping area is another one.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - Total rectangles = 1 (outer) + 2 (overlapping) + 1 (nested) = 4.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<4>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                     ######################     \n                                                     #                    #     \n                                                     #                    #     \n                                        #############█#####################     \n                                        #            #                   ##
