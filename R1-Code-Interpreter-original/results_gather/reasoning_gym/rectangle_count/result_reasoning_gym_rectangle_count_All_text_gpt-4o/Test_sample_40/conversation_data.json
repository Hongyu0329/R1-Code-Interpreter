    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The outermost rectangle is clearly defined by the '#' characters. It starts at the top left corner of the visible grid and extends to the bottom right corner where the '#' characters form a complete boundary.\n   - This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Inner Rectangle:**\n   - Within the outer rectangle, there is a smaller rectangle that starts from a certain point and extends towards the bottom right corner.\n   - This inner rectangle is also outlined by '#' characters and is completely enclosed within the outer rectangle.\n   - This is the second rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The grid also contains '█' characters, which indicate overlapping sections of rectangles.\n   - The overlapping section is where the inner rectangle overlaps with the outer rectangle.\n   - Since the problem states that there can be a maximum of 2 overlapping rectangles, and we have already identified two rectangles, this overlapping section confirms the presence of these two rectangles.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified two distinct rectangles: the outer rectangle and the inner rectangle.\n   - There are no additional rectangles beyond these two, as the grid does not show any other distinct enclosed areas.\n\nBy following these steps, we conclude that there are a total of two rectangles in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                       #########################################\n                                       #
