    "To determine the total number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. These are straightforward to count as they are clearly defined by their borders.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character. Each `█` represents a point where two rectangles overlap. We need to consider these overlaps to ensure we count each rectangle only once.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the start and end of rectangles.\n   - For each rectangle, ensure that it is fully enclosed by `#` or `█` characters.\n   - Keep track of rectangles that have already been counted to avoid double-counting, especially in areas with overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The first rectangle is located at the top right of the grid, outlined by `#` and spanning 6 rows and 12 columns.\n   - The second large rectangle spans almost the entire width of the grid, starting from the third row from the top and extending downwards.\n   - Within this large rectangle, there are smaller rectangles, including:\n     - A rectangle starting at the 10th row, spanning 7 rows and 10 columns.\n     - A rectangle starting at the 15th row, spanning 10 rows and 7 columns.\n     - A rectangle starting at the 25th row, spanning 10 rows and 7 columns.\n     - A rectangle starting at the 35th row, spanning 10 rows and 7 columns.\n     - A rectangle starting at the 45th row, spanning 10 rows and 7 columns.\n   - Overlapping rectangles are found in the middle section of the grid, where `█` characters are present. These indicate two overlapping rectangles, which need to be counted separately.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting all distinct rectangles, including those overlapping, we arrive at the total count.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all rectangles, both single and overlapping, are accounted for accurately.\n\nThe total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
