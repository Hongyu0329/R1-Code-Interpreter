    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify the distinct rectangles based on the characters used to outline them. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Characters Used:**\n   - The grid uses two types of characters to outline rectangles: `#` and `█`.\n   - In this grid, we only see the `#` character, which indicates single rectangles.\n\n2. **Locate the Rectangle:**\n   - The rectangle is located towards the center of the grid.\n   - It is outlined with `#` characters.\n\n3. **Determine the Dimensions:**\n   - The rectangle starts at a certain row and column and ends at another row and column.\n   - The top and bottom edges of the rectangle are represented by a continuous line of `#` characters.\n   - The left and right edges are represented by `#` characters aligned vertically.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Since there is only one distinct rectangle outlined by `#` characters, we count this as one rectangle.\n   - There are no overlapping rectangles indicated by the `█` character in this grid.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After analyzing the grid, we conclude that there is only one rectangle present.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
