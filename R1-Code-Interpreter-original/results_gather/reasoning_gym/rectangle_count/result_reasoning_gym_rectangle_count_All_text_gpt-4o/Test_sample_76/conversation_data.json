    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The outermost rectangle is clearly defined by the continuous line of `#` characters forming a large rectangle. This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Inner Rectangles:**\n   - Within the outer rectangle, there is another rectangle starting from the 4th row from the top of the grid. This rectangle is also outlined by `#` characters and is smaller than the outer rectangle. This is the second rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Inside the inner rectangle, there is a section where `█` characters are used. These characters indicate overlapping rectangles. The overlapping section is a rectangle itself, which is the third rectangle.\n   - The overlapping section is formed by the `█` characters and is surrounded by `#` characters, indicating that it is a distinct rectangle.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified three distinct rectangles:\n     1. The large outer rectangle.\n     2. The smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle.\n     3. The overlapping rectangle indicated by `█` characters.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - After identifying and counting all distinct rectangles, we conclude that there are a total of three rectangles in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n          ####################################################                  \n          #
