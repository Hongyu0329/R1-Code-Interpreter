    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the First Rectangle:**\n   - The first rectangle is clearly outlined with `#` characters at the top of the grid.\n   - It spans from the 41st column to the 81st column horizontally and from the 10th row to the 13th row vertically.\n   - This is a complete rectangle with no overlaps.\n\n2. **Identify the Second Rectangle:**\n   - The second rectangle is located below the first one, starting from the 40th column to the 49th column horizontally and from the 13th row to the 35th row vertically.\n   - This rectangle is also outlined with `#` characters and does not overlap with any other rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify the Third Rectangle:**\n   - The third rectangle is located at the bottom right of the grid.\n   - It spans from the 75th column to the 78th column horizontally and from the 33rd row to the 43rd row vertically.\n   - This rectangle is also outlined with `#` characters and does not overlap with any other rectangle.\n\n4. **Check for Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The problem statement mentions that overlapping rectangles (maximum 2) are shown with `█`.\n   - In this grid, there are no `█` characters, indicating that there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n5. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified three distinct rectangles in the grid.\n   - There are no overlapping rectangles, so the total count remains three.\n\nBased on the analysis, the total number of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n  #########################################                                     \n  #
