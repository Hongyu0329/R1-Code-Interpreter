    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Large Rectangles:**\n   - There is a large rectangle at the top of the grid, outlined with `#` characters. It spans multiple lines and is clearly defined.\n   - There is another large rectangle at the bottom of the grid, also outlined with `#` characters.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - In the middle of the grid, there is a section where rectangles overlap, indicated by the `█` character.\n   - The overlapping section is part of two rectangles:\n     - One rectangle is vertical, extending from the top to the bottom of the overlapping section.\n     - The other rectangle is horizontal, extending from left to right across the overlapping section.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The top large rectangle is one distinct rectangle.\n   - The bottom large rectangle is another distinct rectangle.\n   - The vertical rectangle in the overlapping section is a third distinct rectangle.\n   - The horizontal rectangle in the overlapping section is a fourth distinct rectangle.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - We have identified four distinct rectangles in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
