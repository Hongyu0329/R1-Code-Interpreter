    "To determine the total number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#`. These are single rectangles.\n   - In the grid, there is a vertical rectangle on the right side, starting from row 24 to row 56, and spanning columns 64 to 69. This is a single rectangle.\n   - There is another large rectangle starting from row 18 to row 38, spanning columns 42 to 60. This is also a single rectangle.\n   - Additionally, there is a smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle, starting from row 28 to row 35, spanning columns 50 to 59. This is another single rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`. These represent overlapping rectangles.\n   - In the grid, there is an overlapping area starting from row 24 to row 38, spanning columns 64 to 69. This indicates that the vertical rectangle overlaps with the large rectangle.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Count each distinct rectangle identified in the grid.\n   - From the analysis, we have:\n     - 1 vertical rectangle on the right.\n     - 1 large rectangle.\n     - 1 smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle.\n     - 1 overlapping area indicating an additional rectangle due to overlap.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total:**\n   - Total rectangles = 1 (vertical) + 1 (large) + 1 (small inside large) + 1 (overlapping) = 4.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                               #####            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                                               #   #            \n                                         ###############       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #   #            \n                                         #             #       #####            \n                                         #             #       ##
