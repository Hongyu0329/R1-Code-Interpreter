    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the First Rectangle:**\n   - The first rectangle is outlined with `#` characters and is located in the middle of the grid.\n   - It spans from the 17th row to the 19th row and is quite wide, covering a large portion of the grid horizontally.\n\n2. **Identify the Second Rectangle:**\n   - The second rectangle is also outlined with `#` characters and is located towards the bottom of the grid.\n   - It starts from the 49th row and extends to the 52nd row, covering a significant horizontal space.\n\n3. **Identify the Overlapping Rectangle:**\n   - The overlapping section is represented by `█` characters.\n   - This section is located within the second rectangle, indicating an overlap with another rectangle.\n   - The overlap starts from the 49th row and extends to the 52nd row, but it is narrower than the second rectangle.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The first rectangle is distinct and does not overlap with any other rectangle.\n   - The second rectangle overlaps with another rectangle, as indicated by the `█` characters.\n   - The overlapping section itself forms a third rectangle.\n\n5. **Total Count:**\n   - We have identified three rectangles in total: the first rectangle, the second rectangle, and the overlapping rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n               ############################################################     \n               #
