    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas outlined with `#` that form a closed shape. These are single rectangles.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where `█` is used. This indicates overlapping rectangles. The maximum overlap is 2 rectangles.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the presence of `#` and `█`.\n   - When you encounter a `#`, check if it forms a closed rectangle by looking for a corresponding bottom and side edges.\n   - When you encounter a `█`, note that it represents an overlap, and count it as two rectangles.\n\n4. **Detailed Analysis of the Grid:**\n   - The first visible rectangle starts at line 53 and ends at line 66. It is a large rectangle outlined with `#`.\n   - The second rectangle starts at line 67 and ends at line 71. It overlaps with the first rectangle, as indicated by `█`.\n   - The overlapping area is a smaller rectangle within the larger one, and the `█` indicates that this area is counted as two rectangles.\n\n5. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The large rectangle is counted as one.\n   - The overlapping area is counted as two rectangles due to the `█`.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - Total rectangles = 1 (large rectangle) + 2 (overlapping area) = 3 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                 ############                   \n                                                 #
