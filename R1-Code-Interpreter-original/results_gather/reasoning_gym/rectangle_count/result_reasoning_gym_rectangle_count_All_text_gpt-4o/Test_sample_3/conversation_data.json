    "To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangles:**\n   - The largest rectangle is the outermost one, which spans almost the entire grid. It is outlined with `#` and is easy to spot.\n\n2. **Identify Inner Rectangles:**\n   - Within the large outer rectangle, there are several smaller rectangles. These are also outlined with `#` and can be identified by their distinct corners and edges.\n\n3. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character. These areas need special attention to ensure that each rectangle is counted correctly.\n\n4. **Count Each Rectangle:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, identifying each rectangle by its corners and edges.\n   - Ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted separately, even if they share some edges or corners.\n\n5. **List of Rectangles:**\n   - The outermost rectangle.\n   - A smaller rectangle on the right side, starting from the top.\n   - A vertical rectangle on the left side, starting from the middle.\n   - A horizontal rectangle in the middle, overlapping with the vertical one.\n   - Several smaller rectangles within the larger ones, especially around the areas with `█`.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting each rectangle, ensure that no rectangle is counted more than once.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately count the number of rectangles in the grid. After careful analysis, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<11>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                               ###              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                                                               # #              \n                     #######################################   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #              \n                     #                                     #   # #       ###    \n                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \n                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \n                     #                                     #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   ########          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #                   #      #          #   # #       # #    \n                     #              #####█######█##########█###█#█       # #    \n                     #              #    #      #          #   # █       # #    \n                     #              #    #      #          #   ##█       # #    \n       ##############█##############█####█######█##########█#####█#######█#█#   \n       #             #              #    #      #          #     #       # ##
