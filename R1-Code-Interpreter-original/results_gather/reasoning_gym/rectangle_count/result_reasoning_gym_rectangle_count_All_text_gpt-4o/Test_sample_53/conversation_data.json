    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the First Rectangle:**\n   - The first rectangle is a large one, outlined with `#` characters.\n   - It starts at row 25 and extends to row 41, and spans from column 13 to column 60.\n   - This is a single rectangle with no overlaps.\n\n2. **Identify the Second Rectangle:**\n   - The second rectangle is located towards the bottom right of the grid.\n   - It starts at row 58 and extends to row 62, and spans from column 49 to column 70.\n   - This rectangle is also outlined with `#` characters and does not overlap with any other rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify the Third Rectangle:**\n   - The third rectangle is located just below the second rectangle.\n   - It starts at row 63 and extends to row 66, and spans from column 60 to column 75.\n   - This rectangle is outlined with `#` characters and does not overlap with any other rectangle.\n\n4. **Identify the Fourth Rectangle:**\n   - The fourth rectangle is a small one located at the bottom right corner.\n   - It starts at row 63 and extends to row 66, and spans from column 77 to column 81.\n   - This rectangle is outlined with `#` characters and does not overlap with any other rectangle.\n\n5. **Check for Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The problem states that overlapping rectangles (maximum 2) are shown with `█`.\n   - In this grid, there are no `█` characters, indicating that there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n6. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified four distinct rectangles in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n             ############################################                       \n             #
