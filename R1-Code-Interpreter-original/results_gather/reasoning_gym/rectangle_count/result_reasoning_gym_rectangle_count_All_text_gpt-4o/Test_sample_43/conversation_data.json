    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Large Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The largest rectangle is the one that spans almost the entire grid, outlined by `#` characters. This is the most obvious rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character. We need to identify these areas and determine how many rectangles overlap in these regions.\n\n3. **Count Distinct Rectangles:**\n   - We need to count each distinct rectangle, including those that overlap. This involves identifying the start and end of each rectangle and ensuring that we do not double-count any rectangles.\n\n4. **Break Down the Grid:**\n   - The grid can be broken down into sections where rectangles are clearly defined. We need to look at each section and count the rectangles within.\n\n5. **Consider the Overlapping Areas:**\n   - In the grid, there are areas where two rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`. We need to ensure that these are counted as two separate rectangles.\n\n6. **Count Each Rectangle:**\n   - Carefully count each rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of rectangles in the grid. After analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<9>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                  #############################                 \n                                  #                           #                 \n                                  #                           #                 \n                                  #                           #                 \n                                  #                           #                 \n                                  #    ######                 #                 \n                                  #    #    #                 #                 \n            ######################█####█####█##########       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    #    #         #       #                 \n            #                     #    ######         #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     █###################█##     #                 \n            #                     █                   # #     #      ########## \n            #                     █                   # #     #      #        # \n            #                     █                   # #     #      #        # \n            #                     █                   # #     #      #        # \n            #                     █###################█##     #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      #        # \n            #                     #                   #       #      ########## \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            #                     #                   #       #                 \n            ######################█████████████████████#######█######           \n                                  ##
