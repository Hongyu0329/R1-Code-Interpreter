    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify the patterns formed by the '#' and '█' characters. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Area of Interest**: \n   - The grid is mostly empty except for a section towards the bottom right where there are '#' characters forming a rectangle.\n\n2. **Locate the Rectangle**:\n   - The rectangle is located starting from a certain row and column, extending horizontally and vertically.\n   - The rectangle is outlined with '#' characters.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles**:\n   - Since the problem states that single rectangles are outlined with '#', we need to count the number of distinct rectangles formed by these characters.\n   - Overlapping rectangles would be indicated by '█', but in this grid, there are no '█' characters, indicating no overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **Examine the Grid**:\n   - The grid shows a single rectangle formed by '#' characters.\n   - The rectangle is complete and closed, with no interruptions in the outline.\n\n5. **Final Count**:\n   - Since there is only one distinct rectangle formed by the '#' characters and no overlapping rectangles, the total count of rectangles is 1.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<1>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                       #########\n                                                                       #
