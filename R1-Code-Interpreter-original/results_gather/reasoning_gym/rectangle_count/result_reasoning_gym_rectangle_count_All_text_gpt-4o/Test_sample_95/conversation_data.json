    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify the patterns that form rectangles. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid Area**: The grid is a large empty space with a small section containing characters. We need to focus on the area where the characters are present.\n\n2. **Locate the Characters**: The characters are located towards the right side of the grid. The characters used are `#` which outline the rectangles.\n\n3. **Examine the Pattern**: The pattern of `#` characters forms a rectangle. The rectangle is defined by:\n   - Top side: `###`\n   - Left side: `# #`\n   - Right side: `# #`\n   - Bottom side: `###`\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles**: \n   - The pattern clearly forms a single rectangle. \n   - There are no overlapping rectangles indicated by the character `█`, so we only have to count the single rectangle formed by `#`.\n\n5. **Verify the Rectangle**: \n   - The rectangle is complete with all sides closed.\n   - The rectangle is not overlapping with any other rectangle.\n\n6. **Final Count**: Since there is only one complete rectangle formed by the `#` characters, the total count of rectangles is 1.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
