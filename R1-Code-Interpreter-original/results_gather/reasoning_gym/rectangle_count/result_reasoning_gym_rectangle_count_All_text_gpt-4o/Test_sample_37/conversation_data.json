    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify the distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Borders**: The grid uses `#` to outline rectangles. We need to look for continuous lines of `#` that form closed shapes.\n\n2. **Scan the Grid**: Start from the top and move downwards, scanning each line to identify the start and end of horizontal lines of `#`.\n\n3. **Vertical Lines**: Once a horizontal line is identified, check vertically to see if there are corresponding vertical lines that connect to form a rectangle.\n\n4. **Closed Shapes**: Ensure that the identified lines form a closed shape, which is necessary for it to be considered a rectangle.\n\n5. **Overlapping Rectangles**: The grid can have overlapping rectangles, indicated by `█`. However, in this grid, there are no `█` characters, so we only need to count the non-overlapping rectangles.\n\n6. **Count the Rectangles**: After identifying all closed shapes, count them to get the total number of rectangles.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the given grid:\n\n- The grid shows a single large rectangle outlined by `#`.\n- The rectangle starts at the 9th row and extends to the 52nd row.\n- Horizontally, it spans from the 13th column to the 38th column.\n- There are no overlapping rectangles (`█`), so we only have this one rectangle.\n\nThus, the total count of rectangles in the grid is 1.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
