    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The outermost rectangle is defined by the '#' characters starting from the top left corner of the grid where the rectangle begins.\n   - This rectangle spans from the top row with '#' characters down to the bottom row with '#' characters, and from the leftmost '#' to the rightmost '#'.\n   - This is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Inner Rectangle:**\n   - Inside the outer rectangle, there is another rectangle that is outlined by '#' characters.\n   - This inner rectangle is located towards the left side of the grid and is completely enclosed within the outer rectangle.\n   - This is another distinct rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify the Overlapping Area:**\n   - The overlapping area is indicated by the '█' character.\n   - The '█' character suggests that there is an overlap between two rectangles.\n   - The overlap occurs between the inner rectangle and another rectangle that shares part of its boundary with the inner rectangle.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified the outer rectangle and the inner rectangle.\n   - The presence of the '█' character indicates that there is an overlap, suggesting a third rectangle that shares part of its boundary with the inner rectangle.\n   - Therefore, we have three rectangles in total: the outer rectangle, the inner rectangle, and the overlapping rectangle.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the grid and considering the overlap, we conclude that there are three rectangles in total.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                  #########################################     \n                                  #
