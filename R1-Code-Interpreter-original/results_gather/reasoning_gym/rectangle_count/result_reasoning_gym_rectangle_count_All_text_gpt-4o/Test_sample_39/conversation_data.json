    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. These are straightforward to count.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by the `█` character. Each `█` represents an overlap of two rectangles.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line from left to right.\n   - Keep track of the start and end of each rectangle using the `#` and `█` characters.\n   - For each `█`, ensure to count two rectangles, as it indicates an overlap.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid has several distinct sections where rectangles are present.\n   - The top section has two rectangles: one large rectangle on the left and a smaller one on the right.\n   - The middle section has a large rectangle on the left and a smaller one on the right, with an overlap in the middle.\n   - The bottom section has a small rectangle on the right and a large rectangle on the left.\n\n5. **Detailed Counting:**\n   - **Top Section:**\n     - One large rectangle on the left.\n     - One smaller rectangle on the right.\n   - **Middle Section:**\n     - One large rectangle on the left.\n     - One smaller rectangle on the right.\n     - Overlap in the middle, indicating two rectangles.\n   - **Bottom Section:**\n     - One small rectangle on the right.\n     - One large rectangle on the left.\n\n6. **Total Count:**\n   - Top section: 2 rectangles.\n   - Middle section: 3 rectangles (including overlap).\n   - Bottom section: 2 rectangles.\n\nAdding these up gives us a total of 7 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
