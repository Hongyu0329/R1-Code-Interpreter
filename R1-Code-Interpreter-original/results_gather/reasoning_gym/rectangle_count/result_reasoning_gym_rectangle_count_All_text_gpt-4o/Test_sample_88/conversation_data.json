    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The grid starts with a large rectangle outlined by `#` characters. This is the first and largest rectangle, spanning from the top left to the bottom right of the grid.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Within the large rectangle, there are areas where `█` characters indicate overlapping rectangles. We need to identify these overlaps and count them as separate rectangles.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, identifying each rectangle by its outline.\n   - The first large rectangle is clearly outlined by `#` characters.\n   - As we move down, we encounter a section where `█` characters appear, indicating overlapping rectangles.\n   - Carefully trace the outlines of these overlapping rectangles to ensure each is counted.\n\n4. **Detailed Analysis of Overlapping Areas:**\n   - The first overlap occurs at the bottom of the first large rectangle, where `█` characters appear. This indicates a second rectangle overlapping with the first.\n   - Further down, there are additional `█` characters indicating more overlaps, which need to be counted as separate rectangles.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting each distinct rectangle, including those indicated by `█` characters, we arrive at the total number of rectangles.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all rectangles, including overlapping ones, are counted accurately.\n\nThe total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
