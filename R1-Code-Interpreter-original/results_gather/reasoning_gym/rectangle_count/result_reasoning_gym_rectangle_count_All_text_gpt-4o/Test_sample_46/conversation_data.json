    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Single rectangles are outlined with the character `#`.\n   - We need to look for continuous lines of `#` that form closed shapes.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the character `█`.\n   - We need to identify where these overlaps occur and count them as separate rectangles.\n\n3. **Analyze the Grid:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for `#` and `█`.\n   - When a `#` is encountered, check if it forms a closed rectangle by looking for matching `#` on the same row and column.\n   - When a `█` is encountered, it indicates an overlap, so we need to consider the rectangles that overlap at this point.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - As we identify each rectangle, we keep a count.\n   - Ensure that each rectangle is counted only once, even if it shares sides with another rectangle.\n\n5. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid has a large rectangle starting from the 10th row and spanning downwards, which is outlined by `#`.\n   - Inside this large rectangle, there are smaller rectangles formed by `█` and `#`.\n   - The overlapping areas are clearly marked by `█`, indicating the presence of two overlapping rectangles.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - The large rectangle is one.\n   - The smaller rectangle inside the large one, which overlaps, is another.\n   - The overlapping area itself counts as a separate rectangle.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the grid, we can determine the total number of rectangles present.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is: <<<4>>>."

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                     ###        \n                                                                     #
