    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#`. These are non-overlapping rectangles.\n   - Count each distinct rectangle that is completely enclosed by `#`.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`.\n   - Each `█` represents an overlap of two rectangles. We need to ensure that we count both rectangles involved in the overlap.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line from left to right.\n   - Keep track of the start and end of each rectangle using the `#` and `█` characters.\n   - For each rectangle identified, ensure it is counted only once unless it overlaps, in which case both overlapping rectangles should be counted.\n\n4. **Verify and Sum Up:**\n   - After identifying all rectangles, verify the count by cross-referencing with the grid to ensure no rectangle is missed or double-counted.\n   - Sum up the total number of rectangles, including both single and overlapping ones.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Single Rectangles:**\n  - There are several distinct rectangles outlined by `#` without any overlaps. These are counted individually.\n\n- **Overlapping Rectangles:**\n  - The grid contains areas with `█`, indicating overlaps. Each `█` represents two overlapping rectangles.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles, including both single and overlapping ones, is determined.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<16>>>"

Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                            #########           \n                                                            #       #           \n                                                            #       #           \n                                                            #       #           \n                    ###########                             #       #           \n                    #         #                             #       #           \n                    #         #                             #       #           \n                    #         #                             #       #           \n                    #         #                             #       #           \n                    #         #                             #       #           \n                    #         #                             #       #           \n                    #         #                             #########           \n                    #         #                                                 \n                    #         #                       #####                     \n                    #         #                       #   #                     \n                    #         #                       #   #                     \n                    #         #                       ####█####                 \n                    #         #                       ##
