    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid Area**: The grid is a large area filled mostly with spaces, with some sections containing '#' and '█' characters that outline rectangles.\n\n2. **Locate Rectangles**: \n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the presence of '#' or '█' characters.\n   - When a line with '#' or '█' is found, check the surrounding lines to determine the full extent of the rectangle.\n\n3. **First Rectangle**:\n   - Located towards the top right of the grid.\n   - It starts at line 5 and ends at line 19.\n   - The rectangle is 3 characters wide and 15 characters tall.\n   - It is outlined entirely with '#', indicating it is a single rectangle.\n\n4. **Second Rectangle**:\n   - Located towards the bottom left of the grid.\n   - It starts at line 38 and ends at line 56.\n   - The rectangle is 12 characters wide and 19 characters tall.\n   - It is also outlined entirely with '#', indicating it is a single rectangle.\n\n5. **Check for Overlapping Rectangles**:\n   - The problem states that overlapping rectangles (up to 2) are shown with '█'.\n   - In this grid, there are no '█' characters, indicating no overlapping rectangles.\n\n6. **Count the Rectangles**:\n   - We have identified two distinct rectangles, each outlined with '#'.\n   - There are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n7. **Final Count**:\n   - The total number of rectangles in the grid is 2.\n\nBased on the analysis, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
