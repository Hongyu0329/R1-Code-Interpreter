    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Large Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The largest rectangle is outlined with `#` and spans almost the entire grid. It starts at the top left and extends to the bottom right, forming a large boundary.\n\n2. **Identify the Smaller Rectangles:**\n   - Within the large rectangle, there are smaller rectangles. These are also outlined with `#` and `█`.\n   - The smaller rectangles can be identified by their distinct boundaries, which are either completely enclosed by `#` or `█`.\n\n3. **Count Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by `█`. These areas need to be carefully examined to determine how many rectangles overlap and where they start and end.\n\n4. **List and Count Each Rectangle:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, identifying each rectangle by its unique boundary.\n   - Ensure that each rectangle is counted only once, even if it overlaps with another.\n\n5. **Verify and Double-Check:**\n   - After identifying and counting all rectangles, double-check the grid to ensure no rectangles are missed or counted multiple times.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of rectangles in the grid. After careful analysis, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
