    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The largest rectangle is the outermost one, which is outlined with `#` characters. It spans from the top left to the bottom right of the grid.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character. We need to identify these areas and determine how many rectangles overlap in these regions.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, identifying each rectangle by its unique outline.\n   - Pay special attention to areas with `█` characters, as these indicate overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **List of Rectangles:**\n   - The outermost rectangle is one.\n   - Inside the outer rectangle, there is a smaller rectangle on the right side, starting from the 30th row and extending downwards.\n   - There is another rectangle on the left side, starting from the 50th row and extending downwards.\n   - The overlapping area in the middle of the grid, marked by `█`, indicates two overlapping rectangles.\n\n5. **Total Count:**\n   - The outer rectangle: 1\n   - The smaller rectangle on the right: 1\n   - The smaller rectangle on the left: 1\n   - The overlapping area in the middle: 2 (since it represents two overlapping rectangles)\n\nBy adding these up, we get the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nThe final count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
