    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the presence of `#` and `█` characters that outline rectangles.\n   - A rectangle is defined by a continuous sequence of `#` or `█` characters forming a closed loop.\n\n2. **Count Non-Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The first rectangle is the large one at the top, outlined entirely with `#` characters.\n   - The second rectangle starts below the first one and is also outlined with `#` characters.\n   - The third rectangle is nested within the second rectangle, starting from the line with `#########█` and ending with `#     #  ###`.\n\n3. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character.\n   - The overlap occurs in the middle section of the grid, where two rectangles intersect.\n   - The overlapping section is part of two rectangles: one that extends horizontally and another that extends vertically.\n\n4. **Count Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The horizontal rectangle that overlaps is the one that starts with `#########█` and ends with `#      ##█`.\n   - The vertical rectangle that overlaps is the one that starts with `#########█` and ends with `##############█`.\n\n5. **Total Count:**\n   - Count each distinct rectangle, including those that overlap.\n   - Ensure that each rectangle is counted only once, even if it shares a boundary with another rectangle.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
