    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The largest rectangle is outlined with `#` and spans almost the entire grid. This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Inner Rectangles:**\n   - Inside the large rectangle, there is a smaller rectangle on the right side, also outlined with `#`. This is the second rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - There is a section where two rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`. This overlap occurs in the bottom right section of the grid.\n   - The overlapping area suggests the presence of two additional rectangles, as `█` indicates overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The outermost rectangle is counted as one.\n   - The smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle is counted as another.\n   - The overlapping area suggests two more rectangles, as each `█` represents an overlap of two rectangles.\n\n5. **Total Count:**\n   - We have identified four distinct rectangles: the large outer rectangle, the smaller inner rectangle, and two overlapping rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is four.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                               #############################################    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #                                           #    \n                               #          #################                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                               #          #               #                #    \n                   #############          #               #                #    \n                   #          ##
