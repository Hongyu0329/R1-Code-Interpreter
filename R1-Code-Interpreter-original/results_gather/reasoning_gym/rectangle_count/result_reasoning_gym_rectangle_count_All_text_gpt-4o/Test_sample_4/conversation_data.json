    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Large Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The largest rectangle is outlined by the `#` characters starting from the top left corner and extending to the bottom right corner of the grid. This is the outermost rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character. We need to identify these areas and determine how many rectangles overlap in these regions.\n\n3. **Count Distinct Rectangles:**\n   - We need to count each distinct rectangle, including those that overlap. This involves identifying the start and end points of each rectangle and ensuring that we do not double-count any rectangles.\n\n4. **Break Down the Grid:**\n   - The grid can be broken down into sections where rectangles are clearly defined by `#` and `█` characters. We need to carefully trace each rectangle's perimeter to ensure accurate counting.\n\n5. **Consider Nested Rectangles:**\n   - Some rectangles may be nested within others. We need to ensure that these are counted separately.\n\n6. **Count Each Rectangle:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, identifying each rectangle by its corners and ensuring that overlapping areas are counted correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately count the number of rectangles in the grid. After analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles is determined to be:\n\n<<<9>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n###################################################################             \n#                                                                 #
