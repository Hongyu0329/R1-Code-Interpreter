    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Single rectangles are outlined with `#`.\n   - We start by identifying the largest rectangle, which is the outermost one. It spans from the top left corner of the grid to the bottom right corner, excluding the spaces.\n   - Next, we look for any smaller rectangles that are completely enclosed within the larger rectangle and are also outlined with `#`.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character.\n   - We need to identify areas where two rectangles overlap and count them as separate rectangles.\n   - The `█` character indicates the presence of two overlapping rectangles. We need to trace the boundaries of these overlapping rectangles.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the presence of `#` and `█`.\n   - For each `#`, determine if it forms a new rectangle by checking its surrounding characters.\n   - For each `█`, determine the boundaries of the overlapping rectangles.\n\n4. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - The largest rectangle is the one that starts at the top left corner and extends to the bottom right corner, excluding spaces.\n   - There is a smaller rectangle inside the largest one, starting from the 17th row and extending to the 32nd row, and from the 30th column to the 50th column.\n   - There are overlapping rectangles indicated by `█` in the grid. These need to be carefully traced to determine their boundaries.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying all distinct rectangles, including those overlapping, we count them.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of rectangles in the grid. After careful analysis, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<6>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                             ##################                                 \n                             #
