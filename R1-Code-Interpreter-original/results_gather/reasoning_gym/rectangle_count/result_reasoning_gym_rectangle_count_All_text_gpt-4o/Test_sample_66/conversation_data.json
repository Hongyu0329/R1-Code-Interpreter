    "To determine the number of rectangles in the ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The first and most obvious rectangle is the large one that spans the entire top section of the grid. It is outlined with `#` and is the largest rectangle in the grid.\n\n2. **Identify the Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - In the lower section of the grid, there are overlapping rectangles. The overlapping areas are marked with `█`.\n   - We need to identify each distinct rectangle that contributes to these overlaps.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The first large rectangle is the one that spans from the top to the bottom of the grid, outlined with `#`.\n   - The second rectangle is the one that starts from the left side and extends to the right, overlapping with the first rectangle. This is also outlined with `#`.\n   - The third rectangle is the one that overlaps with the second rectangle, creating the `█` pattern. This rectangle is also outlined with `#`.\n\n4. **Verify Overlaps:**\n   - Ensure that the overlaps are correctly identified and that no additional rectangles are formed by the overlaps.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting each distinct rectangle, we conclude the total number of rectangles.\n\nBased on the analysis, the total number of rectangles in the grid is 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n    #################################################                           \n    #                                               #                           \n    #################################################                           \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                        ####### \n        ################################################################█#    # \n        #                                                               ##
