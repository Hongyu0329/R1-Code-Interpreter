    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Distinct Rectangles:**\n   - We need to look for closed loops of '#' characters that form rectangles.\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by '█', but in this grid, there are no '█' characters, so we only need to count distinct rectangles formed by '#'.\n\n2. **Examine the Grid:**\n   - The grid is mostly empty except for two distinct sections where rectangles are formed.\n\n3. **First Rectangle:**\n   - Located towards the right side of the grid, there is a tall, narrow rectangle formed by '#' characters.\n   - This rectangle is 3 characters wide and 24 characters tall.\n   - It is a single rectangle with no overlaps.\n\n4. **Second Rectangle:**\n   - Located towards the bottom left of the grid, there is a larger rectangle.\n   - This rectangle is 22 characters wide and 13 characters tall.\n   - It is also a single rectangle with no overlaps.\n\n5. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified two distinct rectangles in the grid.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - Since there are no overlapping rectangles, the total count of rectangles is simply the sum of the distinct rectangles identified.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                             ###\n                                                                             #
