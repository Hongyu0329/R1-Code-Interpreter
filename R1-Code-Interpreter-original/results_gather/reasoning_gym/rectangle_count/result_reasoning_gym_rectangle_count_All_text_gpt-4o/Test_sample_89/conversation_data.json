    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The outermost rectangle is clearly defined by the '#' characters.\n   - It starts at the top left corner of the grid section provided and extends to the bottom right corner of the same section.\n   - This is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Inner Rectangle:**\n   - Inside the outer rectangle, there is another rectangle that is also outlined by '#' characters.\n   - This inner rectangle is smaller and is located towards the bottom of the outer rectangle.\n   - It is defined by the lines of '#' characters that are interrupted by '█' characters.\n\n3. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The '█' characters indicate overlapping sections of rectangles.\n   - The overlap occurs in the vertical section of the inner rectangle, suggesting that there is a second rectangle overlapping with the inner rectangle.\n   - This second rectangle shares part of its boundary with the inner rectangle, as indicated by the '█' characters.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified three distinct rectangles:\n     - The large outer rectangle.\n     - The smaller inner rectangle.\n     - An overlapping rectangle that shares part of its boundary with the inner rectangle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, there are a total of three rectangles in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                           ########################################             \n                           #
