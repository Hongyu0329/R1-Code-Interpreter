    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles, including those that overlap.\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - The large rectangle in the middle of the grid is outlined with `#` and is quite prominent. It spans from the top left corner of the grid to the bottom right, excluding the overlapping areas.\n   - There is a smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle, also outlined with `#`, located towards the bottom right of the grid.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The overlapping areas are marked with `█`. These areas indicate where two rectangles overlap.\n   - The first overlapping rectangle is located towards the top left of the grid, overlapping with the large rectangle.\n   - The second overlapping rectangle is located towards the bottom right of the grid, overlapping with the large rectangle.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The large rectangle is counted as one.\n   - The smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle is counted as another.\n   - The two overlapping rectangles are counted separately, as they are distinct from the large rectangle.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - Large rectangle: 1\n   - Smaller rectangle inside: 1\n   - Overlapping rectangle on the top left: 1\n   - Overlapping rectangle on the bottom right: 1\n\nAdding these, we get a total of 4 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<4>>>"

Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                    ####################################                        \n                    #
