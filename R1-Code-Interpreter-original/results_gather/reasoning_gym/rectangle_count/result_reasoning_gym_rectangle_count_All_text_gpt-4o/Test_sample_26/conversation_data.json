    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. The grid uses two characters to outline rectangles: `#` for single rectangles and `█` for overlapping rectangles. \n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for closed loops of `#` characters that form a rectangle.\n   - Ensure that each rectangle is fully enclosed by `#` characters without any gaps.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where `█` characters are present, indicating overlapping rectangles.\n   - Determine the boundaries of each overlapping rectangle by identifying the start and end of the `█` characters and the surrounding `#` characters.\n\n3. **Count Each Rectangle:**\n   - Count each distinct rectangle, whether it is a single rectangle or part of an overlapping set.\n   - Ensure that each rectangle is counted only once, even if it shares sides with another rectangle.\n\n4. **Verify Completeness:**\n   - Double-check the grid to ensure no rectangles are missed.\n   - Pay special attention to areas with complex overlapping to ensure accurate counting.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Single Rectangles:**\n  - There are several single rectangles outlined by `#` characters. These are straightforward to count as they are not overlapping with others.\n\n- **Overlapping Rectangles:**\n  - The `█` characters indicate overlapping rectangles. We need to carefully trace the boundaries of each rectangle involved in the overlap.\n\nAfter analyzing the grid, we find the following:\n\n- There are 9 single rectangles.\n- There are 3 overlapping areas, each involving 2 rectangles.\n\nThus, the total number of rectangles is the sum of single rectangles and the rectangles involved in overlaps:\n\n- Total rectangles = 9 (single) + 3 (overlapping areas, each with 2 rectangles) = 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<15>>>"
