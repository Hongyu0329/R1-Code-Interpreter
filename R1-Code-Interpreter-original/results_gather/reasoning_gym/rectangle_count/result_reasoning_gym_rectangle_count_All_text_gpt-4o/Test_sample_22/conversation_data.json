    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The outermost rectangle is clearly defined by the continuous line of `#` characters. It forms a large rectangle that encompasses the entire structure.\n   - This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Within the outer rectangle, there are sections where `█` characters are used. These indicate overlapping rectangles.\n   - The first set of `█` characters appears in the top right section of the grid, forming a smaller rectangle that overlaps with the outer rectangle.\n   - The second set of `█` characters appears in the middle of the grid, forming another rectangle that overlaps with both the outer rectangle and the first overlapping rectangle.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The outer rectangle is counted as one.\n   - The first overlapping rectangle is counted as a second rectangle.\n   - The second overlapping rectangle is counted as a third rectangle.\n\n4. **Verify Overlaps:**\n   - Ensure that the `█` characters are correctly interpreted as overlapping areas. In this grid, they indicate two distinct overlapping rectangles within the outer rectangle.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After identifying and counting all distinct rectangles, we conclude that there are three rectangles in total.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                          ###########################           \n                                          #                         #           \n                                          #                   ######█########   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #                   #     #       #   \n                                          #             ######█#####█########   \n                                          #             #     #     #      ##
