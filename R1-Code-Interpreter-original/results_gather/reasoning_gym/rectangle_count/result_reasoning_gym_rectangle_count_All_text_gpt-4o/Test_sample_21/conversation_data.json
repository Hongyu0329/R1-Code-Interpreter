    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas enclosed by `#` symbols that form a complete rectangle.\n   - Count each distinct rectangle that is not overlapping with another.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where `█` symbols are used, indicating overlapping rectangles.\n   - Determine how many rectangles overlap in these areas by analyzing the surrounding `#` symbols.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - For each distinct rectangle identified, increment the count.\n   - Ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\n4. **Verify and Double-Check:**\n   - Go through the grid again to ensure no rectangles are missed.\n   - Pay special attention to areas with `█` symbols to ensure all overlapping rectangles are counted.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Single Rectangles:**\n  - There is a large rectangle at the top of the grid.\n  -

    "\nAnalyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points. Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.
