  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. \n   - In the grid, there is a small rectangle in the top right corner:\n     ```\n     ###\n     # #\n     # #\n     # #\n     # #\n     # #\n     # #\n     # #\n     ```\n   - This is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`.\n   - In the grid, there is a large rectangle that overlaps with the small rectangle:\n     ```\n     ##########################\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #                         #\n     #############################\n     ```\n   - The overlap occurs at the bottom of the small rectangle and the top of the large rectangle, indicated by `█`.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified two rectangles:\n     - The small rectangle in the top right corner.\n     - The large rectangle that overlaps with the small rectangle.\n\n4. **Final Count:**\n   - Total number of rectangles = 2.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
