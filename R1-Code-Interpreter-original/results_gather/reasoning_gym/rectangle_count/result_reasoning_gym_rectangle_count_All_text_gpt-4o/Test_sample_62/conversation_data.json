    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The largest rectangle is outlined with `#` and spans from the top left to the bottom right of the grid. This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character. We need to identify these areas and determine how many distinct rectangles they form.\n\n3. **Examine the Overlapping Area:**\n   - There is a vertical overlapping section on the left side of the grid, which is a smaller rectangle overlapping with the outer rectangle.\n   - There is also a horizontal overlapping section towards the bottom of the grid, which is another smaller rectangle overlapping with the outer rectangle.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The outer rectangle is counted as one.\n   - The vertical overlapping rectangle on the left is counted as a second rectangle.\n   - The horizontal overlapping rectangle towards the bottom is counted as a third rectangle.\n\n5. **Verify Overlaps:**\n   - Ensure that the overlapping areas do not form additional distinct rectangles beyond the ones already counted.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that there are three distinct rectangles in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                           #############################################        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                                           #        \n                           #                               ########    #        \n                           #                               #      #    #        \n                       ####█#####                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          #      #    #        \n                       #   #    #                          ########    #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n                       #   #    #                                      #        \n         ##############█###█####█##########################         ####        \n         #             ####█#####                         #         # ##
