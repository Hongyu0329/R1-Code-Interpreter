    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Look for rectangles outlined with `#` that do not overlap with any other rectangle. These are the simplest to identify.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Look for areas where rectangles overlap, indicated by `█`. These areas can be part of two overlapping rectangles.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the start and end of rectangles.\n   - For each rectangle, ensure that it is closed on all sides by `#` or `█`.\n   - Keep track of rectangles that have already been counted to avoid double-counting.\n\n4. **Consider Overlapping Areas:**\n   - In areas with `█`, determine how many rectangles overlap and ensure each is counted separately.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the grid:\n\n- **Single Rectangles:**\n  - There are several single rectangles outlined with `#`. These include smaller rectangles and larger ones that do not overlap with others.\n\n- **Overlapping Rectangles:**\n  - There are areas with `█` indicating overlaps. We need to identify how many rectangles overlap in these areas.\n\n- **Counting:**\n  - Carefully count each distinct rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\nAfter analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles is determined to be:\n\n<<<9>>>"
