    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the first rectangle:**\n   - The first rectangle is located at the top of the grid. It is a large rectangle outlined with `#` characters.\n   - It spans from the 1st to the 21st row and from the 68th to the 81st column.\n   - This is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the second rectangle:**\n   - The second rectangle is located towards the bottom left of the grid.\n   - It is outlined with `#` characters and spans from the 28th to the 42nd row and from the 7th to the 58th column.\n   - This is another single rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify the third rectangle:**\n   - The third rectangle is located towards the bottom right of the grid.\n   - It is outlined with `#` characters and spans from the 28th to the 42nd row and from the 70th to the 79th column.\n   - This is another single rectangle.\n\n4. **Identify the overlapping rectangles:**\n   - There is an overlapping section in the grid where two rectangles intersect, indicated by the `█` character.\n   - This overlap occurs between the second and third rectangles.\n   - The overlapping area spans from the 44th to the 46th row and from the 70th to the 73rd column.\n   - This overlap indicates the presence of two overlapping rectangles.\n\n5. **Count the rectangles:**\n   - We have identified three distinct rectangles and one overlapping section that accounts for two additional rectangles.\n   - Therefore, the total count of rectangles is 3 (distinct) + 2 (overlapping) = 5.\n\nThus, the total number of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                   ############ \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   #          # \n                                                                   ############ \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                      ######### \n                                                                      #       # \n      ####################################################            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      #                                                  #            #       # \n      ####################################################            #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                              ########################█###    # \n                                              #                       #  #    # \n                                              ########################█###    # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                                      #       # \n                                                  #####################       # \n                                                  #                  ##
