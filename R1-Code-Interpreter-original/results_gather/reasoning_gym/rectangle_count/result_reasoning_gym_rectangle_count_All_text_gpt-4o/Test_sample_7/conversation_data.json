    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangles:**\n   - Start by identifying the outermost rectangles and then move inward to find any overlapping or nested rectangles.\n\n2. **Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The largest rectangle is the one that spans from the top left to the bottom right, outlined by `#` and `█`. This is the main rectangle that encompasses most of the grid.\n\n3. **Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - There are two overlapping sections marked by `█`. These indicate the presence of overlapping rectangles.\n   - The first overlap is in the middle of the grid, where a vertical rectangle intersects with the main horizontal rectangle.\n   - The second overlap is at the bottom, where another vertical rectangle intersects with the main horizontal rectangle.\n\n4. **Counting the Rectangles:**\n   - The main outer rectangle is counted as one.\n   - Each overlapping section indicates an additional rectangle. Since there are two overlapping sections, this suggests two additional rectangles.\n\n5. **Additional Rectangles:**\n   - There is a smaller rectangle at the bottom of the grid, separate from the main structure, which is outlined by `#`.\n\n6. **Total Count:**\n   - Main outer rectangle: 1\n   - Overlapping rectangles: 2\n   - Separate smaller rectangle at the bottom: 1\n\nBy adding these up, we get the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nThe total count of rectangles is <<<4>>>."
