    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Single rectangles are outlined with `#`.\n   - We need to look for closed loops of `#` that form rectangles.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by `█`.\n   - Each `█` can be part of two overlapping rectangles.\n\n3. **Scan the Grid:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move row by row.\n   - For each row, look for sequences of `#` or `█` that form the top or bottom of a rectangle.\n   - Track vertical sequences of `#` or `█` that form the sides of rectangles.\n\n4. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - For each complete loop of `#` or `█`, count it as a rectangle.\n   - Ensure that overlapping rectangles are counted separately.\n\n5. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - The large rectangle in the middle of the grid is outlined with `#` and contains smaller rectangles within it.\n   - There are two smaller rectangles on the right side of the large rectangle, overlapping with it, indicated by `█`.\n   - At the bottom of the grid, there is another large rectangle with a smaller rectangle inside it, also overlapping, indicated by `█`.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - Count each distinct rectangle, ensuring that overlapping rectangles are counted as separate entities.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of rectangles in the grid.\n\nAfter analyzing the grid, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<8>>>"

Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                         #########################              \n                                         #                       #              \n                                         #                       #              \n                                         #                       #              \n                                         #                       #              \n                                         #                       ############   \n                                         #                       ##
