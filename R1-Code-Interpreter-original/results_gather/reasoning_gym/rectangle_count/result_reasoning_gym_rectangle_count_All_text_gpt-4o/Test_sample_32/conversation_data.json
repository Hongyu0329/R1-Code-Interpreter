    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - Single rectangles are outlined with the character `#`.\n   - We need to look for closed loops of `#` that form rectangles.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the character `█`.\n   - We need to identify where these overlaps occur and count them as separate rectangles.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, scanning each line for the start and end of rectangles.\n   - For each rectangle, ensure that it is closed on all sides by `#` or `█`.\n   - Keep track of rectangles that overlap by noting the `█` character.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid contains several distinct sections where rectangles are formed.\n   - The first rectangle starts at the 17th row and spans a large area.\n   - There is a smaller rectangle starting at the 5th row and ending at the 13th row.\n   - Another rectangle starts at the 20th row and ends at the 35th row.\n   - Overlapping rectangles are found where `█` is present, indicating two rectangles overlap in those areas.\n\n5. **Count Each Rectangle:**\n   - The large rectangle from row 17 to row 35 is one rectangle.\n   - The smaller rectangle from row 5 to row 13 is another rectangle.\n   - The rectangle from row 20 to row 35 is a third rectangle.\n   - The overlapping area with `█` indicates two overlapping rectangles, which should be counted as two separate rectangles.\n\n6. **Final Count:**\n   - Total rectangles identified: 5 (including overlaps).\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                         ###############################################        \n                         #                                             #        \n                         #                                             #        \n                         #                                             #        \n###########              #                                             #        \n#         #              #                                             #        \n#         #              #                                             #        \n#         #              ############################█████████████████##        \n#         #                                          #               #          \n#         #                                          #               #          \n#         #                                          #               #          \n#         #                                          #               #          \n###########                                          #               #          \n                                                     #               #          \n                                                     #               #          \n                                                     #               #          \n  #############################                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #                           #                      #               #          \n  #############█##############█######################█####           #          \n  ##
