    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangles:**\n   - The grid contains a large outer rectangle that spans almost the entire width of the grid. This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Inner Rectangles:**\n   - Within the large outer rectangle, there is another rectangle that is slightly smaller and is outlined with `#`. This is the second rectangle.\n\n3. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Inside the smaller rectangle, there is a section where the `#` characters overlap with `█` characters. This indicates the presence of overlapping rectangles.\n   - The overlapping section forms a third rectangle, which is outlined with `█`.\n\n4. **Identify Additional Rectangles:**\n   - Within the overlapping section, there is a smaller rectangle outlined with `#` that is completely enclosed by the `█` rectangle. This is the fourth rectangle.\n\n5. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified four distinct rectangles: the large outer rectangle, the smaller rectangle inside it, the overlapping rectangle, and the small rectangle within the overlapping section.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the grid and identifying each distinct rectangle, we can conclude that there are a total of four rectangles present in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles is:\n\n<<<4>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                       #########################                \n                                       #
