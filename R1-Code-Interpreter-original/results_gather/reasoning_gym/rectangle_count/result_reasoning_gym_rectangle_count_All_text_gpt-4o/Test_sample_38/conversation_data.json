    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all distinct rectangles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangle:**\n   - The grid contains a large rectangle outlined with `#` characters. This rectangle spans from the 18th row to the 57th row and from the 42nd column to the 51st column. This is the first rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify the Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Within the large rectangle, there is a section where the `#` characters are replaced by `█` characters, indicating overlapping rectangles.\n   - The overlapping section is located from the 38th row to the 44th row and from the 37th column to the 65th column.\n\n3. **Count the Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The overlapping section forms a smaller rectangle within the larger rectangle. This smaller rectangle is outlined by `█` characters and is distinct from the large rectangle.\n   - The overlapping section suggests the presence of two rectangles: one that overlaps with the large rectangle and another that is distinct but shares the same space.\n\n4. **Total Count of Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified one large rectangle and two overlapping rectangles within the grid.\n   - Therefore, the total count of rectangles is 3.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude the total number of rectangles present in the grid.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                         #########                              \n                                         #
