    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangles:**\n   - The grid contains several large rectangles outlined with `#`. We need to identify each of these separately.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by the `█` character. We need to consider these overlaps and count them as separate rectangles.\n\n3. **Count Rectangles:**\n   - Start from the top of the grid and move downwards, identifying each rectangle by its corners and ensuring not to double-count any rectangle.\n\n4. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - The first large rectangle starts at the 9th row and spans down to the 27th row, and from the 8th column to the 41st column.\n   - Inside this large rectangle, there is a smaller rectangle starting at the 11th row and spanning down to the 19th row, and from the 18th column to the 39th column.\n   - Another rectangle is present from the 20th row to the 27th row, and from the 41st column to the 48th column.\n   - A separate rectangle starts at the 30th row and spans down to the 38th row, and from the 37th column to the 78th column.\n   - Inside this rectangle, there is another smaller rectangle from the 32nd row to the 36th row, and from the 47th column to the 76th column.\n   - Another rectangle starts at the 40th row and spans down to the 48th row, and from the 37th column to the 78th column.\n   - Inside this rectangle, there is another smaller rectangle from the 42nd row to the 46th row, and from the 47th column to the 76th column.\n   - The final large rectangle starts at the 50th row and spans down to the 58th row, and from the 3rd column to the 78th column.\n   - Inside this rectangle, there are two smaller rectangles: one from the 52nd row to the 56th row, and from the 13th column to the 36th column, and another from the 52nd row to the 56th row, and from the 47th column to the 76th column.\n\n5. **Count the Total Rectangles:**\n   - After identifying all distinct rectangles, we count them. The grid contains a total of 11 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
