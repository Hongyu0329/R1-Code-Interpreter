    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Single Rectangles:**\n   - A single rectangle is outlined with `#`.\n   - The first large rectangle starts at row 29 and extends to row 56, from column 8 to column 24. This is a single rectangle.\n\n2. **Identify Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - Overlapping rectangles are indicated by `█`.\n   - At row 57, column 12, there is a `█`, indicating an overlap. This suggests that there are two rectangles overlapping in this region.\n   - The first overlapping rectangle starts at row 57, column 8, and extends to row 64, column 24.\n   - The second overlapping rectangle starts at row 57, column 12, and extends to row 64, column 24.\n\n3. **Identify Additional Rectangles:**\n   - Another rectangle starts at row 65, column 12, and extends to row 72, column 24.\n   - A smaller rectangle starts at row 65, column 28, and extends to row 72, column 36.\n   - The final rectangle starts at row 73, column 28, and extends to row 80, column 36.\n\n4. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - We have identified the following rectangles:\n     - One large single rectangle.\n     - Two overlapping rectangles.\n     - One additional rectangle below the overlapping region.\n     - Two smaller rectangles to the right of the overlapping region.\n\n5. **Total Count:**\n   - Total rectangles = 1 (large) + 2 (overlapping) + 1 (below overlap) + 2 (right of overlap) = 6 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<6>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n       ###############                                                          \n       #
