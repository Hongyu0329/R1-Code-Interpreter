    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify the distinct rectangles. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid Area**: The grid is a large area filled mostly with spaces, except for a section where characters form a rectangle.\n\n2. **Locate the Rectangle**: \n   - The rectangle is outlined with the character `#`.\n   - It starts at a certain position and ends at another, forming a closed shape.\n\n3. **Examine the Rectangle**:\n   - The rectangle is formed by the `#` characters, creating a border.\n   - The interior of the rectangle is filled with spaces, indicating it is a single rectangle.\n\n4. **Check for Overlapping Rectangles**:\n   - The problem states that overlapping rectangles (up to 2) are shown with the character `█`.\n   - In this grid, there are no `█` characters, indicating there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n5. **Count the Rectangles**:\n   - Since there is only one distinct rectangle formed by the `#` characters and no overlapping rectangles, the total count of rectangles is 1.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final count of rectangles is enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBased on the analysis, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<1>>>"

Then try to acquire the final answer with step by step analysis.\nIn the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question. Do not output the code for execution.\n    Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn. How many rectangles do you see in the grid below?\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n                                  ########                                      \n                                  #
