    "To determine the number of rectangles in the given ASCII grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify each distinct rectangle. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Outer Rectangles:**\n   - The first step is to identify the large outer rectangles. There is one large rectangle at the top, outlined by `#`, and another large rectangle at the bottom, also outlined by `#`.\n\n2. **Identify the Overlapping Rectangles:**\n   - The grid uses `█` to indicate overlapping rectangles. We need to identify these areas and determine how many rectangles overlap.\n   - In the grid, there are two areas where `█` is used:\n     - The first area is in the middle of the top rectangle, where a smaller rectangle overlaps with the larger one.\n     - The second area is at the bottom of the top rectangle, where another smaller rectangle overlaps.\n\n3. **Count the Rectangles:**\n   - The top large rectangle is one rectangle.\n   - Within the top rectangle, there are two smaller rectangles that overlap with it, indicated by the `█` characters.\n   - The bottom large rectangle is another rectangle.\n\n4. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - Total rectangles in the grid:\n     - 1 large rectangle at the top.\n     - 2 smaller overlapping rectangles within the top rectangle.\n     - 1 large rectangle at the bottom.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total:**\n   - Add up all the rectangles identified: 1 (top large) + 2 (overlapping) + 1 (bottom large) = 4 rectangles.\n\nTherefore, the total count of rectangles in the grid is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
