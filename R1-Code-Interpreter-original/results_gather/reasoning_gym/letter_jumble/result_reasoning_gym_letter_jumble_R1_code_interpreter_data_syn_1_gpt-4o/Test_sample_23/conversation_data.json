Your task is to unscramble the words.\n\nThe order of the words in the sentence is preserved. Moreover, the style of the sentence is preserved (i.e. punctuation, capitalization, new lines, etc.).\n\nYour output should be a sentence with the words unscrambled, and enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets, like <<<sentence>>>.\n\nNow, unscramble these words: etxenivse ni eth wdrol cegishtrnt\n",

    "To unscramble the words in the sentence, we need to identify the correct words that match the given scrambled versions. The sentence is \"etxenivse ni eth wdrol cegishtrnt\". \n\n1. **etxenivse**: This word seems to be scrambled. A possible unscrambled word is \"extensive\".\n2. **ni**: This word is already unscrambled as \"in\".\n3. **eth**: This word is scrambled. A possible unscrambled word is \"the\".\n4. **wdrol**: This word is scrambled. A possible unscrambled word is \"world\".\n5. **cegishtrnt**: This word is scrambled. A possible unscrambled word is \"stretching\".\n\nNow, let's verify these words by checking if they match the scrambled versions. We can use a Python script to check if the sorted characters of the scrambled word match the sorted characters of the possible unscrambled word.\n\n```python\ndef unscramble(scrambled, possible):\n    return sorted(scrambled) == sorted(possible)\n\nwords = [\n    (\"etxenivse\", \"extensive\"),\n    (\"ni\", \"in\"),\n    (\"eth\", \"the\"),\n    (\"wdrol\", \"world\"),\n    (\"cegishtrnt\", \"stretching\")\n]\n\nresults = [unscramble(scrambled, possible) for scrambled, possible in words]\nprint(results)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify our unscrambled words.",
    "The code output indicates that all the scrambled words have been correctly matched with their possible unscrambled versions. Therefore, the unscrambled sentence is:\n\n<<<extensive in the world stretching>>>"
