    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each word and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **iMehalc**: This can be rearranged to form \"Michael\".\n2. **S**: This is already unscrambled as \"S\".\n3. **arHt**: This can be rearranged to form \"Hart\".\n4. **wsa**: This can be rearranged to form \"was\".\n5. **eht**: This can be rearranged to form \"the\".\n6. **iigortaron**: This can be rearranged to form \"originator\".\n7. **fo**: This is already unscrambled as \"of\".\n8. **eht**: This can be rearranged to form \"the\".\n9. **jrcPeto**: This can be rearranged to form \"Project\".\n10. **Gutnrbege**: This can be rearranged to form \"Gutenberg\".\n11. **ecntopc**: This can be rearranged to form \"concept\".\n12. **fo**: This is already unscrambled as \"of\".\n13. **a**: This is already unscrambled as \"a\".\n14. **iralbry**: This can be rearranged to form \"library\".\n15. **fo**: This is already unscrambled as \"of\".\n16. **eneriloctc**: This can be rearranged to form \"electronic\".\n17. **skrow**: This can be rearranged to form \"works\".\n\nNow, putting all the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence, we get:\n\n<<<Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works>>>"
