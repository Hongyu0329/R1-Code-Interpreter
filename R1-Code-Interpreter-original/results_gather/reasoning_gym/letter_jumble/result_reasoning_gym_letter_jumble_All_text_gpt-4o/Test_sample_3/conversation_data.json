    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its most likely original form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **rM**: This is likely \"Mr\" as it is capitalized and fits the context of a name.\n2. **Smtih**: This is likely \"Smith,\" a common surname.\n3. **inntsouec**: This could be \"continues,\" which fits the context of a sentence.\n4. **ihs**: This is likely \"his,\" a common pronoun.\n5. **dounr**: This is likely \"round,\" a common word that fits the context.\n6. **nad**: This is likely \"and,\" a common conjunction.\n7. **tneers**: This is likely \"enters,\" a verb that fits the context.\n8. **eht**: This is likely \"the,\" a common article.\n9. **rpotreers**: This is likely \"reporters,\" a noun that fits the context.\n10. **ahll**: This is likely \"hall,\" a noun that fits the context.\n11. **reHe**: This is likely \"Here,\" a capitalized word that fits the context.\n12. **rreoptesr**: This is likely \"reporters,\" similar to \"rpotreers.\"\n13. **ni**: This is likely \"in,\" a common preposition.\n14. **theri**: This is likely \"their,\" a common possessive pronoun.\n15. **eesprcteiv**: This is likely \"respective,\" an adjective that fits the context.\n16. **slpcea**: This is likely \"places,\" a noun that fits the context.\n17. **gacnif**: This is likely \"facing,\" a verb that fits the context.\n18. **na**: This is likely \"an,\" a common article.\n19. **eauql**: This is likely \"equal,\" an adjective that fits the context.\n20. **buenmr**: This is likely \"number,\" a noun that fits the context.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"Mr Smith continues his round and enters the reporters' hall. Here, reporters in their respective places, facing an equal number.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<Mr Smith continues his round and enters the reporters' hall. Here, reporters in their respective places, facing an equal number.>>>"
