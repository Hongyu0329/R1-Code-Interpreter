    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Words**: The sentence provided is \"nstaodino ni olcatosni eehrw ew\". The words are:\n   - nstaodino\n   - ni\n   - olcatosni\n   - eehrw\n   - ew\n\n2. **Unscramble Each Word**:\n   - **nstaodino**: This can be rearranged to form the word \"astonish\".\n   - **ni**: This is already a valid word, \"in\".\n   - **olcatosni**: This can be rearranged to form the word \"isolation\".\n   - **eehrw**: This can be rearranged to form the word \"where\".\n   - **ew**: This can be rearranged to form the word \"we\".\n\n3. **Reconstruct the Sentence**: After unscrambling, the words form the sentence:\n   - \"astonish in isolation where we\"\n\n4. **Preserve the Style**: The original sentence does not have any punctuation or capitalization that needs to be preserved, so the unscrambled sentence remains the same.\n\n5. **Enclose in Triple Angle Brackets**: Finally, enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets.\n\nThe unscrambled sentence is:\n<<<astonish in isolation where we>>>"
