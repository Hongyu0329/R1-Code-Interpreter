    "To unscramble the words in the sentence, we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the words**: The sentence provided is \"uyor eoicdvrsy Teh\". It consists of three words: \"uyor\", \"eoicdvrsy\", and \"Teh\".\n\n2. **Unscramble each word**:\n   - **\"uyor\"**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"your\".\n   - **\"eoicdvrsy\"**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"discovery\".\n   - **\"Teh\"**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"The\". Note that the capitalization is preserved, so the first letter should be capitalized.\n\n3. **Reconstruct the sentence**: After unscrambling each word, we reconstruct the sentence by placing the words in their original order: \"The your discovery\".\n\n4. **Preserve the style**: The original sentence does not contain any punctuation or special formatting other than capitalization, so we maintain the capitalization of the first word.\n\n5. **Enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets**: As instructed, we enclose the final unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final unscrambled sentence:\n\n<<<The your discovery>>>"
