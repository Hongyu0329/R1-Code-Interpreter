    "To unscramble the words in the sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **definytiveli**: \n   - The word has 13 letters.\n   - The letters include: d, e, f, i, n, y, t, i, v, e, l, i.\n   - A likely unscrambled word is \"definitively,\" which matches the letter count and uses all the letters.\n\n2. **settdel**:\n   - The word has 7 letters.\n   - The letters include: s, e, t, t, d, e, l.\n   - A likely unscrambled word is \"settled,\" which matches the letter count and uses all the letters.\n\n3. **Ttah**:\n   - The word has 4 letters.\n   - The letters include: T, t, a, h.\n   - A likely unscrambled word is \"That,\" which matches the letter count and uses all the letters. The capitalization of the first letter is preserved.\n\n4. **greta**:\n   - The word has 5 letters.\n   - The letters include: g, r, e, t, a.\n   - A likely unscrambled word is \"great,\" which matches the letter count and uses all the letters.\n\nNow, we combine the unscrambled words while preserving the order and style of the original sentence:\n\n- Original sentence: \"definytiveli settdel Ttah greta\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"definitively settled That great\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<definitively settled That great>>>"
