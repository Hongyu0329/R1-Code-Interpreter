    "To unscramble the words in the sentence \"cna od tiwh shit korw,\" we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Word 1: \"cna\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"can\"\n\n2. **Word 2: \"od\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"do\"\n\n3. **Word 3: \"tiwh\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"with\"\n\n4. **Word 4: \"shit\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"this\"\n\n5. **Word 5: \"korw\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"work\"\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words while preserving the original order and style:\n\n- Original sentence: \"cna od tiwh shit korw\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"can do with this work\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<can do with this work>>>"
