    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its most likely original form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **mrof**: This is likely \"from\".\n2. **selerav**: This is likely \"several\".\n3. **drintep**: This is likely \"printed\".\n4. **ediniots**: This is likely \"editions\".\n5. **all**: This word is already unscrambled.\n6. **fo**: This is likely \"of\".\n7. **wihch**: This is likely \"which\".\n8. **aer**: This is likely \"are\".\n9. **confermid**: This is likely \"confirmed\".\n10. **sa**: This is likely \"as\".\n11. **nto**: This is likely \"not\".\n12. **proteetcd**: This is likely \"protected\".\n13. **yb**: This is likely \"by\".\n14. **copyrtghi**: This is likely \"copyright\".\n15. **ni**: This is likely \"in\".\n16. **hte**: This is likely \"the\".\n17. **U**: This is already unscrambled.\n18. **S**: This is already unscrambled.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U S\"\n\nFinally, enclosing the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U S>>>"
