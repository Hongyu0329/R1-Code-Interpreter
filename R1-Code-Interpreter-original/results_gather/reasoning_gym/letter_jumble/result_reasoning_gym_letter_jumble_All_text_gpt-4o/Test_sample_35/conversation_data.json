    "To unscramble the words in the sentence \"cypo ti giev ti away,\" we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **cypo**: \n   - Possible unscrambled words: \"copy\"\n   - \"Copy\" is a valid English word.\n\n2. **ti**: \n   - Possible unscrambled words: \"it\"\n   - \"It\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **giev**: \n   - Possible unscrambled words: \"give\"\n   - \"Give\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **ti**: \n   - Possible unscrambled words: \"it\"\n   - \"It\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **away**: \n   - The word \"away\" is already unscrambled and is a valid English word.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words while preserving the order and style:\n\n- Original sentence: \"cypo ti giev ti away\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"copy it give it away\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<copy it give it away>>>"
