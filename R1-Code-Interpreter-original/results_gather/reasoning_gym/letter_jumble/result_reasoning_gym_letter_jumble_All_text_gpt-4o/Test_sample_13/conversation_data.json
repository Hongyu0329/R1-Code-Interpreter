    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and possible English words. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **asdenutrnds**: This word can be unscrambled to form \"understands\". It fits well in the context of a sentence.\n\n2. **ohw**: This is likely a simple scramble of the word \"who\".\n\n3. **a**: This word is already unscrambled as \"a\".\n\n4. **amn**: This can be unscrambled to form \"man\".\n\n5. **stduetai**: This can be unscrambled to form \"situation\".\n\n6. **sa**: This is already unscrambled as \"as\".\n\n7. **mSiht**: This can be unscrambled to form \"Smith\". The capitalization suggests it is a proper noun, likely a name.\n\n8. **si**: This is already unscrambled as \"is\".\n\n9. **msut**: This can be unscrambled to form \"must\".\n\n10. **eb**: This is already unscrambled as \"be\".\n\n11. **tesbe**: This can be unscrambled to form \"best\".\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"understands who a man situation as Smith is must be best\"\n\nThis sentence doesn't make complete sense, so let's rearrange it slightly to form a coherent sentence:\n\n\"A man who understands a situation as Smith is must be best.\"\n\nNow, let's enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<A man who understands a situation as Smith is must be best>>>"
