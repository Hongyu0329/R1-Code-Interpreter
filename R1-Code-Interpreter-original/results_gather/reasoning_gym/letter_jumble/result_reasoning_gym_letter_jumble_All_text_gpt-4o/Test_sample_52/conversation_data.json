    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its possible correct form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **fo**: This is likely \"of\" as it is a common short word.\n2. **tehes**: This could be \"these\" as it fits the context and letter arrangement.\n3. **aosrbb**: This is likely \"absorb\" as it is a common word that fits the letter pattern.\n4. **dan**: This is likely \"and\" as it is a common conjunction.\n5. **oscnende**: This could be \"condense\" as it fits the context and letter arrangement.\n6. **the**: This is already unscrambled as \"the\".\n7. **invgil**: This is likely \"living\" as it fits the context and letter pattern.\n8. **crofe**: This could be \"force\" as it fits the context and letter arrangement.\n9. **odninaetc**: This is likely \"contained\" as it fits the context and letter pattern.\n10. **ni**: This is likely \"in\" as it is a common short word.\n11. **eth**: This is likely \"the\" as it is a common article.\n12. **sun**: This is already unscrambled as \"sun\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence, we get:\n\n<<<of these absorb and condense the living force contained in the sun>>>"
