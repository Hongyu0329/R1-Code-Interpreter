    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **hcolera**: This word can be unscrambled to form \"cholera,\" which is a disease.\n\n2. **teh**: This is a common scrambling of the word \"the.\"\n\n3. **yewlol**: This can be unscrambled to form \"yellow,\" which is often associated with \"yellow fever.\"\n\n4. **feevr**: This can be unscrambled to form \"fever,\" which pairs with \"yellow\" to form \"yellow fever,\" another disease.\n\n5. **ttah**: This is a common scrambling of the word \"that.\"\n\n6. **eht**: This is another common scrambling of the word \"the.\"\n\n7. **rllbigeeents**: This can be unscrambled to form \"intelligible,\" which fits the context of the sentence.\n\n8. **migth**: This is a common scrambling of the word \"might.\"\n\n9. **spdear**: This can be unscrambled to form \"spread,\" which is a common action associated with diseases.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"cholera the yellow fever that the intelligible might spread\"\n\nEnclose the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<cholera the yellow fever that the intelligible might spread>>>"
