    "To unscramble the words in the sentence \"ni eht nognimr a atelb\", we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **Word: \"ni\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"in\"\n\n2. **Word: \"eht\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"the\"\n\n3. **Word: \"nognimr\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"morning\"\n\n4. **Word: \"a\"**\n   - This is already a valid word: \"a\"\n\n5. **Word: \"atelb\"**\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"table\"\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words while preserving the original order and style:\n\n- Original sentence: \"ni eht nognimr a atelb\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"in the morning a table\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<in the morning a table>>>"
