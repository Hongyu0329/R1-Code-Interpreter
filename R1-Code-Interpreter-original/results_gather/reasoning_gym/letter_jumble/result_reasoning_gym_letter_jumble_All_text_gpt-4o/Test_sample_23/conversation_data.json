    "To unscramble the words in the sentence, we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **etxenivse**: \n   - The word has 9 letters.\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"extensive\".\n\n2. **ni**:\n   - The word has 2 letters.\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"in\".\n\n3. **eth**:\n   - The word has 3 letters.\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"the\".\n\n4. **wdrol**:\n   - The word has 5 letters.\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"world\".\n\n5. **cegishtrnt**:\n   - The word has 10 letters.\n   - Possible unscrambled word: \"stretching\".\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n- Original scrambled sentence: \"etxenivse ni eth wdrol cegishtrnt\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"extensive in the world stretching\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<extensive in the world stretching>>>"
