    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **for**: This word is already unscrambled.\n2. **het**: This is likely \"the\".\n3. **hewol**: This could be \"whole\".\n4. **wrlod**: This is likely \"world\".\n5. **doucl**: This is likely \"could\".\n6. **eb**: This is likely \"be\".\n7. **eye**: This is already unscrambled.\n8. **sisnwsete**: This is likely \"witnesses\".\n9. **fo**: This is likely \"of\".\n10. **het**: This is likely \"the\".\n11. **necfeorrmpa**: This is likely \"performance\".\n12. **a**: This is already unscrambled.\n13. **petorrer**: This is likely \"reporter\".\n14. **mwehaelin**: This is likely \"meanwhile\".\n15. **eikl**: This is likely \"like\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"For the whole world could be eye witnesses of the performance a reporter meanwhile like.\"\n\nEnclose the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<For the whole world could be eye witnesses of the performance a reporter meanwhile like>>>"
