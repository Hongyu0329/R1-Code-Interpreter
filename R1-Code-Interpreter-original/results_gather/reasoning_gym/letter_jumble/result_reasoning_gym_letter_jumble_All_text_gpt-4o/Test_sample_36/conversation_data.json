    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its correct form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **ePctrjo**: This appears to be \"Project\" with the first letter capitalized.\n2. **gbeunteGr**: This is likely \"Gutenberg\" with the first letter capitalized.\n3. **Lieratry**: This is \"Literary\" with the first letter capitalized.\n4. **hAvcrie**: This is \"Archive\" with the first letter capitalized.\n5. **ndotnaFiou**: This is \"Foundation\" with the first letter capitalized.\n6. **heT**: This is \"The\" with the first letter capitalized.\n7. **Pjtoecr**: This is \"Project\" with the first letter capitalized.\n8. **rGtegenbu**: This is \"Gutenberg\" with the first letter capitalized.\n9. **rLieyrta**: This is \"Literary\" with the first letter capitalized.\n10. **Acrhive**: This is \"Archive\" with the first letter capitalized.\n11. **Fndtoiuaon**: This is \"Foundation\" with the first letter capitalized.\n12. **si**: This is \"is\" in lowercase.\n13. **a**: This is \"a\" in lowercase.\n14. **nno**: This is \"non\" in lowercase.\n15. **ritofp**: This is \"profit\" in lowercase.\n16. **c**: This is \"c\" in lowercase, likely a typo or an incomplete word.\n17. **eicuotnlaad**: This is \"educational\" in lowercase.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit educational.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit educational.>>>"
