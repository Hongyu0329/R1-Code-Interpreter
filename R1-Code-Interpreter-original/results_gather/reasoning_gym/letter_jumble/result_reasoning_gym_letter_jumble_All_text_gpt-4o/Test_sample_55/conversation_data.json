    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **tish**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"this.\"\n\n2. **norginm**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"morning.\"\n\n3. **was**: This word is already unscrambled and is the word \"was.\"\n\n4. **tno**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"not.\"\n\n5. **giragdn**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"grading.\"\n\n6. **fo**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"of.\"\n\n7. **gbeilsnss**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"blessing.\"\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n- Original scrambled sentence: \"tish norginm was tno giragdn fo gbeilsnss\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"this morning was not grading of blessing\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<this morning was not grading of blessing>>>"
