    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **ogtiinanb**: This word can be rearranged to form \"obtaining\".\n2. **a**: This word is already unscrambled as \"a\".\n3. **cypo**: This word can be rearranged to form \"copy\".\n4. **opun**: This word can be rearranged to form \"upon\".\n5. **reqeust**: This word can be rearranged to form \"request\".\n6. **fo**: This word is already unscrambled as \"of\".\n7. **teh**: This word can be rearranged to form \"the\".\n8. **wokr**: This word can be rearranged to form \"work\".\n9. **ni**: This word is already unscrambled as \"in\".\n10. **sti**: This word can be rearranged to form \"its\".\n11. **lriginao**: This word can be rearranged to form \"original\".\n12. **Plani**: This word can be rearranged to form \"Plain\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original Plain\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original Plain>>>"
