    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **IIPLMED**: This word can be rearranged to form \"IMPLIED\".\n\n2. **INCLNDIUG**: This word can be rearranged to form \"INCLUDING\".\n\n3. **TUB**: This word is already in its correct form, \"BUT\".\n\n4. **NTO**: This word can be rearranged to form \"NOT\".\n\n5. **LIMIDET**: This word can be rearranged to form \"LIMITED\".\n\n6. **OT**: This word is already in its correct form, \"TO\".\n\n7. **AWRRANTIES**: This word can be rearranged to form \"WARRANTIES\".\n\n8. **FO**: This word can be rearranged to form \"OF\".\n\n9. **NERCHAMTABILTIY**: This word can be rearranged to form \"MERCHANTABILITY\".\n\n10. **RO**: This word can be rearranged to form \"OR\".\n\n11. **FITENSS**: This word can be rearranged to form \"FITNESS\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\nThe unscrambled sentence is: \"IMPLIED INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS\".\n\nEnclosing the sentence in triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n\n<<<IMPLIED INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS>>>"
