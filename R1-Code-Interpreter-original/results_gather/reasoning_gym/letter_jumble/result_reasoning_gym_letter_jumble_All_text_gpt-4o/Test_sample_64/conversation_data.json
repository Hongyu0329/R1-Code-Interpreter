    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and common English vocabulary. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **attacehd**: This could be \"attached\".\n2. **lufl**: This is likely \"full\".\n3. **rPocejt**: The capitalization suggests a proper noun or title, likely \"Project\".\n4. **Gbtenuerg**: The capitalization and letter arrangement suggest \"Gutenberg\".\n5. **enceisL**: The capitalization suggests a proper noun or title, likely \"License\".\n6. **whne**: This is likely \"when\".\n7. **yuo**: This is likely \"you\".\n8. **sahre**: This is likely \"share\".\n9. **ti**: This is likely \"it\".\n10. **twthoui**: This is likely \"without\".\n11. **cahgre**: This is likely \"charge\".\n12. **hitw**: This is likely \"with\".\n13. **rtoehs**: This is likely \"others\".\n14. **D**: This is likely \"D.\" as it appears to be an initial or abbreviation.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"attached full Project Gutenberg License when you share it without charge with others D.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<attached full Project Gutenberg License when you share it without charge with others D.>>>"
