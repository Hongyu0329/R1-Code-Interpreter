    "To unscramble the words in the sentence \"teh osppeiot dsie hwo wnsko,\" we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **teh**: This is a common misspelling of the word \"the.\" By rearranging the letters, we get \"the.\"\n\n2. **osppeiot**: This word is scrambled. By examining the letters, we can rearrange them to form the word \"opposite.\"\n\n3. **dsie**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"side.\"\n\n4. **hwo**: This is a common misspelling of the word \"who.\" By rearranging the letters, we get \"who.\"\n\n5. **wnsko**: This word can be rearranged to form the word \"knows.\"\n\nNow, let's put the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the original order and style:\n\n- Original sentence: \"teh osppeiot dsie hwo wnsko\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"the opposite side who knows\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<the opposite side who knows>>>"
