    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **ntcoain**: \n   - The letters are n, t, c, o, a, i, n.\n   - Possible word: \"contain\" (matches all letters and is a valid English word).\n\n2. **Dtfeecs**: \n   - The letters are D, t, f, e, e, c, s.\n   - Possible word: \"Defects\" (matches all letters, starts with a capital 'D', and is a valid English word).\n\n3. **scuh**: \n   - The letters are s, c, u, h.\n   - Possible word: \"such\" (matches all letters and is a valid English word).\n\n4. **sa**: \n   - The letters are s, a.\n   - Possible word: \"as\" (matches all letters and is a valid English word).\n\n5. **ubt**: \n   - The letters are u, b, t.\n   - Possible word: \"but\" (matches all letters and is a valid English word).\n\n6. **ton**: \n   - The letters are t, o, n.\n   - Possible word: \"not\" (matches all letters and is a valid English word).\n\nNow, we reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words while preserving the order and style:\n\n- Original scrambled sentence: \"ntcoain Dtfeecs scuh sa ubt ton\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"contain Defects such as but not\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<contain Defects such as but not>>>"
