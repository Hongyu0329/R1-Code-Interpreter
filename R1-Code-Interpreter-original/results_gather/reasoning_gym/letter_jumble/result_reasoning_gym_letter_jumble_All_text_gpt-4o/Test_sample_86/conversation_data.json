    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context of the sentence. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **nncldiiug**: This word is likely \"including\". The letters match, and it fits the context of the sentence.\n\n2. **pagiyn**: This word is likely \"paying\". The letters match, and it makes sense in the context of the sentence.\n\n3. **yoasltier**: This word is likely \"royalties\". The letters match, and it fits the context of the sentence.\n\n4. **fro**: This word is likely \"for\". The letters match, and it fits the context of the sentence.\n\n5. **esu**: This word is likely \"use\". The letters match, and it fits the context of the sentence.\n\n6. **fo**: This word is likely \"of\". The letters match, and it fits the context of the sentence.\n\n7. **teh**: This word is likely \"the\". The letters match, and it fits the context of the sentence.\n\n8. **jPorect**: This word is likely \"Project\". The letters match, and it fits the context of the sentence. The capitalization suggests it is a proper noun.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the original sentence, we get:\n\n<<<including paying royalties for use of the Project>>>"
