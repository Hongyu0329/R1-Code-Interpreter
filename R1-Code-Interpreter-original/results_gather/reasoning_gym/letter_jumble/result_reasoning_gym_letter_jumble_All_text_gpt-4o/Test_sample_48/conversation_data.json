    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **wlil**: This word is likely \"will\" as it is a common word and fits the context of the sentence.\n\n2. **eb**: This is likely \"be\" as it is a common auxiliary verb.\n\n3. **eknild**: This word is likely \"linked\" as it fits the context of the sentence and uses all the letters.\n\n4. **ot**: This is likely \"to\" as it is a common preposition.\n\n5. **eht**: This is likely \"the\" as it is a common article.\n\n6. **rPojtce**: This word is likely \"Project\" as it fits the context and uses all the letters.\n\n7. **Guerngetb**: This word is likely \"Gutenberg\" as it fits the context of a project name and uses all the letters.\n\n8. **Lsceine**: This word is likely \"License\" as it fits the context and uses all the letters.\n\n9. **fro**: This is likely \"for\" as it is a common preposition.\n\n10. **lal**: This is likely \"all\" as it is a common word and fits the context.\n\n11. **osrkw**: This word is likely \"works\" as it fits the context and uses all the letters.\n\nNow, putting all the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence, we get:\n\n<<<will be linked to the Project Gutenberg License for all works>>>"
