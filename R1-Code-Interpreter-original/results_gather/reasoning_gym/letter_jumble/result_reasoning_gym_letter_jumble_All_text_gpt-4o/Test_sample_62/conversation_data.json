    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **remvoing**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"removing.\"\n\n2. **na**: This is likely the word \"an.\"\n\n3. **eneirt**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"entire.\"\n\n4. **ciyt**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"city.\"\n\n5. **lal**: This is likely the word \"all.\"\n\n6. **ta**: This is likely the word \"at.\"\n\n7. **oecn**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"once.\"\n\n8. **fmor**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"from.\"\n\n9. **eno**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"one.\"\n\n10. **plaec**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"place.\"\n\n11. **ot**: This is likely the word \"to.\"\n\n12. **naother**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"another.\"\n\n13. **Hsi**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"His.\"\n\n14. **speaicl**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"special.\"\n\n15. **orpject**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"project.\"\n\n16. **hda**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"had.\"\n\n17. **ot**: This is likely the word \"to.\"\n\n18. **od**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"do.\"\n\n19. **iwth**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"with.\"\n\n20. **teh**: The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"the.\"\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence, we get:\n\n<<<removing an entire city all at once from one place to another His special project had to do with the>>>"
