    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **os**: This could be \"so.\"\n2. **atht**: This is likely \"that.\"\n3. **ti**: This is \"it.\"\n4. **yam**: This could be \"may.\"\n5. **ees**: This is likely \"see.\"\n6. **untesrdand**: This is \"understand.\"\n7. **adn**: This is \"and.\"\n8. **mbrereem**: This is \"remember.\"\n9. **teh**: This is \"the.\"\n10. **reasnos**: This is \"reasons.\"\n11. **which**: This is already unscrambled.\n12. **eteirmend**: This is \"determined.\"\n13. **hte**: This is \"the.\"\n14. **pelionrysat**: This is \"personality.\"\n15. **ttah**: This is \"that.\"\n16. **atsc**: This is \"cast.\"\n17. **tJsu**: This is \"Just.\"\n18. **tyuds**: This is \"study.\"\n19. **uyolsfre**: This is \"yourself.\"\n20. **sa**: This is \"as.\"\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"So that it may see, understand, and remember the reasons which determined the personality that cast Just study yourself as.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<So that it may see, understand, and remember the reasons which determined the personality that cast Just study yourself as>>>"
