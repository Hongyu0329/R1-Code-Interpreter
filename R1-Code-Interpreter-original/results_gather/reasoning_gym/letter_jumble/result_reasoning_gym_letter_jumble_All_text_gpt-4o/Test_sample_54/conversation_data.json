    "To unscramble the words in the sentence \"shTi gveienn eyrV\", we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Word 1: \"shTi\"**\n   - The word \"shTi\" is likely a scrambled version of a word that starts with a capital letter, as it is the first word in the sentence.\n   - Possible unscrambled words include \"This\" or \"Hits\". Given the context of a sentence, \"This\" is more likely.\n\n2. **Word 2: \"gveienn\"**\n   - The word \"gveienn\" is a scrambled word with seven letters.\n   - By rearranging the letters, we can form the word \"evening\", which is a common word and fits well in a sentence.\n\n3. **Word 3: \"eyrV\"**\n   - The word \"eyrV\" is a scrambled word with four letters, and it starts with a capital letter.\n   - Possible unscrambled words include \"Very\" or \"Yver\". \"Very\" is a common word and fits well in a sentence.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the original sentence, we get:\n\n\"This evening Very\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<This evening Very>>>"
