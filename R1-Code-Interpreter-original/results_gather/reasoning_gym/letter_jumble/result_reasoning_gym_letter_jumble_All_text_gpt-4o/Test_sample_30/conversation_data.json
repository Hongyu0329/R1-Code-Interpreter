    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and common English vocabulary. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **dhsi**: This word is likely \"dish\" as it is a common English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n2. **Fro**: This word is likely \"For\" as it is capitalized and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n3. **lkie**: This word is likely \"like\" as it is a common English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n4. **lla**: This word is likely \"all\" as it is a common English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n5. **aewlthy**: This word is likely \"wealthy\" as it is a common English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n6. **oflk**: This word is likely \"folk\" as it is a common English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n7. **ni**: This word is likely \"in\" as it is a common English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n8. **uor**: This word is likely \"our\" as it is a common English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\nNow, putting all the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence, we get:\n\n<<<This For like all wealthy folk in our>>>"
