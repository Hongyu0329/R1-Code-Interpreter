    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its correct form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **ym**: This is likely \"my\" as it is a common two-letter word.\n2. **omclrucatau**: This could be \"automacular\" or \"accumulator,\" but given the context, it is likely \"automacular.\"\n3. **wrsko**: This is likely \"works.\"\n4. **ta**: This is likely \"at.\"\n5. **aNagria**: This is likely \"Niagara,\" as it is a well-known location.\n6. **Fro**: This is likely \"For.\"\n7. **rM**: This is likely \"Mr.\"\n8. **htimS**: This is likely \"Smith.\"\n9. **ahs**: This is likely \"has.\"\n10. **boiatend**: This is likely \"obtained.\"\n11. **a**: This is likely \"a.\"\n12. **lease**: This is likely \"lease.\"\n13. **fo**: This is likely \"of.\"\n14. **hte**: This is likely \"the.\"\n15. **arget**: This is likely \"great.\"\n16. **sflla**: This is likely \"falls.\"\n17. **fo**: This is likely \"of.\"\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"My automacular works at Niagara. For Mr. Smith has obtained a lease of the great falls of.\"\n\nEnclosing the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<My automacular works at Niagara. For Mr. Smith has obtained a lease of the great falls of.>>>"
