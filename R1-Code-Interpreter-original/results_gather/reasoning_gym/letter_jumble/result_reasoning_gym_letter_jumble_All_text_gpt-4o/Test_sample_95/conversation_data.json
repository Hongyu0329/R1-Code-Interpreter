    "To unscramble the words in the sentence \"heT isrft nhigt hatt\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Words**: The sentence is composed of four words: \"heT\", \"isrft\", \"nhigt\", and \"hatt\".\n\n2. **Unscramble Each Word**:\n   - \"heT\": The capital letter \"T\" suggests that this is the beginning of the sentence. The possible unscrambled word is \"The\".\n   - \"isrft\": By rearranging the letters, the word \"first\" can be formed.\n   - \"nhigt\": By rearranging the letters, the word \"thing\" can be formed.\n   - \"hatt\": By rearranging the letters, the word \"that\" can be formed.\n\n3. **Preserve Sentence Structure**: The original sentence structure, including capitalization and word order, should be maintained. The first word \"The\" is capitalized because it starts the sentence.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Sentence**: Combine the unscrambled words in the original order to form the sentence: \"The first thing that\".\n\n5. **Enclose in Triple Angle Brackets**: According to the instructions, the final sentence should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<The first thing that>>>"
