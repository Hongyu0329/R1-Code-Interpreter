    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **oogtrf**: This word can be rearranged to form \"forgot\".\n2. **ot**: This is already a valid word, \"to\".\n3. **note**: This can be rearranged to form \"note\".\n4. **het**: This can be rearranged to form \"the\".\n5. **tmei**: This can be rearranged to form \"time\".\n6. **nda**: This can be rearranged to form \"and\".\n7. **os**: This is already a valid word, \"so\".\n8. **ma**: This is already a valid word, \"am\".\n9. **a**: This is already a valid word, \"a\".\n10. **tetlli**: This can be rearranged to form \"little\".\n11. **tlae**: This can be rearranged to form \"late\".\n12. **Yes**: This is already a valid word, \"Yes\".\n13. **a**: This is already a valid word, \"a\".\n14. **telitl**: This can be rearranged to form \"little\".\n15. **grelowd**: This can be rearranged to form \"wordleg\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n<<<forgot to note the time and so am a little late Yes a little wordleg>>>"
