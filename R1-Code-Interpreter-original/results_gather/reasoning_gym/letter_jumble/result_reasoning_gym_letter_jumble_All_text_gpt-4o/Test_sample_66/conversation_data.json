    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its most likely original form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **oFrm**: This is likely \"From\". The capital \"F\" suggests it is the first word of the sentence.\n\n2. **hte**: This is a common scramble for \"the\".\n\n3. **ady**: This is likely \"day\".\n\n4. **ehnw**: This is likely \"when\".\n\n5. **shete**: This is likely \"these\".\n\n6. **wto**: This is likely \"two\".\n\n7. **inntmusetrs**: This is likely \"instruments\".\n\n8. **were**: This word is already unscrambled.\n\n9. **cvrtoedin**: This is likely \"converted\".\n\n10. **si**: This is likely \"is\".\n\n11. **ot**: This is likely \"to\".\n\n12. **eb**: This is likely \"be\".\n\n13. **dated**: This word is already unscrambled.\n\n14. **eht**: This is a common scramble for \"the\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the original order and style:\n\n<<<From the day when these two instruments were converted is to be dated the>>>"
