    "To unscramble the words in the sentence, we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **fo**: This is a two-letter word. The most likely unscrambled word is \"of.\"\n\n2. **noircalustji**: This is a longer word. By examining the letters, we can attempt to rearrange them to form a meaningful word. The letters can be rearranged to form the word \"journalistic.\"\n\n3. **wrok**: This is a four-letter word. By rearranging the letters, we can form the word \"work.\"\n\n4. **wsa**: This is a three-letter word. By rearranging the letters, we can form the word \"was.\"\n\n5. **onw**: This is a three-letter word. By rearranging the letters, we can form the word \"now.\"\n\nNow, let's put the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n- Original sentence: \"fo noircalustji wrok wsa onw\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"of journalistic work was now\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<of journalistic work was now>>>"
