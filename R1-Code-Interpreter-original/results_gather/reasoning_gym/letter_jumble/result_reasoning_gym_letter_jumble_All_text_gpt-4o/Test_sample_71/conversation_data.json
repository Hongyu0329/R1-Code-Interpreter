    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and attempt to identify the correct word based on context and possible word formations. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **tyeh**: This is likely \"they\".\n2. **are**: This word is already unscrambled.\n3. **erev**: This is likely \"ever\".\n4. **aseridgnsd**: This is likely \"disagreed\".\n5. **ot**: This word is already unscrambled.\n6. **het**: This is likely \"the\".\n7. **nearicAm**: This is likely \"American\".\n8. **nmveonergt**: This is likely \"government\".\n9. **ivna**: This is likely \"in a\".\n10. **taoilmcspn**: This is likely \"compilation\".\n11. **A**: This word is already unscrambled.\n12. **imcpaagn**: This is likely \"campaign\".\n13. **stgiaan**: This is likely \"against\".\n14. **eth**: This is likely \"the\".\n15. **naaenxnito**: This is likely \"annexation\".\n16. **hatt**: This is likely \"that\".\n17. **has**: This word is already unscrambled.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"They are ever disagreed to the American government in a compilation. A campaign against the annexation that has.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<They are ever disagreed to the American government in a compilation. A campaign against the annexation that has.>>>"
