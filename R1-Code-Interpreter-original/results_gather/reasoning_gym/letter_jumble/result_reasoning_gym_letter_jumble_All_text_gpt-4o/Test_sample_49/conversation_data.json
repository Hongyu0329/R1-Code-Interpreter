    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the letters provided. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **insrgi**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"rising.\"\n\n2. **cseldrea**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"cleared.\"\n\n3. **het**: This is a common scrambled form of the word \"the.\"\n\n4. **nma**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"man.\"\n\n5. **ot**: This is a common scrambled form of the word \"to.\"\n\n6. **eb**: This is a common scrambled form of the word \"be.\"\n\n7. **adde**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"dead.\"\n\n8. **deaD**: This is already unscrambled and is the word \"Dead,\" with capitalization preserved.\n\n9. **lemsaicx**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"exclaims.\"\n\n10. **reevy**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"every.\"\n\n11. **eon**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"one.\"\n\n12. **eteprns**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"presents.\"\n\n13. **sYe**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"Yes,\" with capitalization preserved.\n\n14. **sawnesr**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"answers.\"\n\n15. **rD**: This is already unscrambled and is the abbreviation \"Dr,\" with capitalization preserved.\n\n16. **iisklnW**: This can be unscrambled to form the name \"Wilkins,\" with capitalization preserved.\n\n17. **aedd**: This can be unscrambled to form the word \"dead.\"\n\n18. **And**: This is already unscrambled and is the word \"And,\" with capitalization preserved.\n\n19. **how**: This is already unscrambled and is the word \"how.\"\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n<<<Rising cleared the man to be dead. Dead exclaims every one presents. Yes answers Dr. Wilkins, dead. And how.>>>"
