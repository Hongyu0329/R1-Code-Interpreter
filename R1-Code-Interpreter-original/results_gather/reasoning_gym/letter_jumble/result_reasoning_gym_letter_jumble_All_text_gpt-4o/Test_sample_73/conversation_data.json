    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **hte**: This is likely \"the\" as it is a common article in English.\n2. **clal**: This could be \"call\" as it is a common word and fits the context.\n3. **fo**: This is likely \"of\" as it is a common preposition.\n4. **itearepmi**: This could be \"imperative\" as it fits the context and uses all the letters.\n5. **yudt**: This is likely \"duty\" as it is a common word and fits the context.\n6. **gliht**: This could be \"light\" as it is a common adjective and fits the context.\n7. **heatedr**: This is likely \"hearted\" as it fits the context and uses all the letters.\n8. **eh**: This is likely \"he\" as it is a common pronoun.\n9. **gpnissr**: This could be \"springs\" as it fits the context and uses all the letters.\n10. **fmro**: This is likely \"from\" as it is a common preposition.\n11. **ihs**: This is likely \"his\" as it is a common possessive pronoun.\n12. **ebd**: This could be \"bed\" as it is a common noun and fits the context.\n13. **adn**: This is likely \"and\" as it is a common conjunction.\n14. **ertens**: This could be \"enters\" as it fits the context and uses all the letters.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence:\n\n\"The call of imperative duty light hearted he springs from his bed and enters.\"\n\nEnclose the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<The call of imperative duty light hearted he springs from his bed and enters>>>"
