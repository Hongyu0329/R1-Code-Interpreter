    "To unscramble the words in the sentence, we need to analyze each word individually and determine the most likely correct word based on the given letters. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **whti**: \n   - The letters are w, h, t, i.\n   - Possible words: \"with\" is a common word that fits these letters.\n\n2. **a**: \n   - This is already a valid word, \"a\".\n\n3. **miosnwe**: \n   - The letters are m, i, o, s, n, w, e.\n   - Possible words: \"mission\" is a common word that fits these letters.\n\n4. **Wrehe**: \n   - The letters are W, r, e, h, e.\n   - Possible words: \"Where\" is a common word that fits these letters, and it maintains the capitalization.\n\n5. **haev**: \n   - The letters are h, a, e, v.\n   - Possible words: \"have\" is a common word that fits these letters.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n- Original sentence: \"whti a miosnwe Wrehe haev\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"with a mission Where have\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<with a mission Where have>>>"
