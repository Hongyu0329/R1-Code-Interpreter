    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the letters provided. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **regulitang**: This word can be rearranged to form \"regulating.\"\n\n2. **iharitces**: This word can be rearranged to form \"charities.\"\n\n3. **dna**: This is a simple scramble of \"and.\"\n\n4. **charitable**: This word is already unscrambled.\n\n5. **donatnois**: This word can be rearranged to form \"donations.\"\n\n6. **ni**: This is a simple scramble of \"in.\"\n\n7. **all**: This word is already unscrambled.\n\n8. **ttases**: This word can be rearranged to form \"states.\"\n\n9. **fo**: This is a simple scramble of \"of.\"\n\n10. **eht**: This is a simple scramble of \"the.\"\n\n11. **Utined**: This word can be rearranged to form \"United.\"\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"regulating charities and charitable donations in all states of the United\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<regulating charities and charitable donations in all states of the United>>>"
