    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each word and determine its most likely correct form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **fo**: This is likely \"of\" since it is a common two-letter word.\n2. **teh**: This is a common misspelling of \"the\".\n3. **eeoplp**: By rearranging the letters, this can be unscrambled to \"people\".\n4. **fo**: Again, this is likely \"of\".\n5. **areGt**: The capitalization suggests a proper noun, and the letters can be rearranged to form \"Great\".\n6. **Birtain**: This is a misspelling of \"Britain\".\n7. **hwo**: This can be rearranged to \"who\".\n8. **tlli**: This can be rearranged to \"still\".\n9. **nwo**: This can be rearranged to \"own\".\n10. **ahd**: This can be rearranged to \"had\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"of the people of Great Britain who still now had\"\n\nFinally, enclosing the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<of the people of Great Britain who still now had>>>"
