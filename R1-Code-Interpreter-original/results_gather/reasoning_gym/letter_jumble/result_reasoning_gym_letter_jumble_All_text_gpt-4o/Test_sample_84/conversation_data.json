    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **arYe**: This could be \"Year\".\n2. **asw**: This is already \"was\".\n3. **tirsf**: This could be \"first\".\n4. **eshlibpdu**: This could be \"published\".\n5. **ni**: This is already \"in\".\n6. **eth**: This is already \"the\".\n7. **rebuaryF**: This could be \"February\".\n8. **p**: This is likely a standalone letter, possibly \"p\".\n9. **tI**: This is already \"It\".\n10. **asw**: This is already \"was\".\n11. **epsibluhd**: This could be \"published\".\n12. **ni**: This is already \"in\".\n13. **Fnerca**: This could be \"France\".\n14. **het**: This is already \"the\".\n15. **tnxe**: This could be \"next\".\n16. **year**: This is already \"year\".\n17. **thghouAl**: This could be \"Although\".\n18. **pdlbsihue**: This could be \"published\".\n19. **nrued**: This could be \"under\".\n20. **eth**: This is already \"the\".\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"Year was first published in the February p It was published in France the next year Although published under the\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<Year was first published in the February p It was published in France the next year Although published under the>>>"
