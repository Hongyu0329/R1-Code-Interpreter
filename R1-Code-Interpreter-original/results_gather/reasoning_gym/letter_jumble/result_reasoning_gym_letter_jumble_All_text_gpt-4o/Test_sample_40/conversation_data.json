    "To unscramble the words in the sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **peasss**: \n   - The letters are: p, e, a, s, s, s.\n   - Possible words include \"passes\" or \"spases\". \n   - \"Passes\" is a valid English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n2. **ot**: \n   - The letters are: o, t.\n   - The only valid English word with these letters is \"to\".\n\n3. **the**: \n   - The letters are: t, h, e.\n   - The word is already unscrambled as \"the\".\n\n4. **ipcetnoer**: \n   - The letters are: i, p, c, e, t, n, o, e, r.\n   - Possible words include \"reception\", \"perceiton\", etc.\n   - \"Reception\" is a valid English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\n5. **cebahrm**: \n   - The letters are: c, e, b, a, h, r, m.\n   - Possible words include \"chamber\", \"becharm\", etc.\n   - \"Chamber\" is a valid English word and fits the context of a sentence.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence:\n\n- Original scrambled sentence: \"peasss ot the ipcetnoer cebahrm\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"passes to the reception chamber\"\n\nFinally, enclosing the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<passes to the reception chamber>>>"
