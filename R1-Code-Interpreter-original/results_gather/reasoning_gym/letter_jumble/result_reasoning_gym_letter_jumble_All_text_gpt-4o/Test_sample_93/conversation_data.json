    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **ckocl**: This word can be unscrambled to form \"clock,\" which is a common word that fits the context of a sentence.\n\n2. **arswdnee**: This word can be unscrambled to form \"answered,\" which is a verb that makes sense in a sentence structure.\n\n3. **rM**: This is likely \"Mr,\" which is a common title used before a surname.\n\n4. **Stimh**: This can be unscrambled to form \"Smith,\" which is a common surname.\n\n5. **adn**: This is a simple scramble of \"and,\" a common conjunction.\n\n6. **iwth**: This can be unscrambled to form \"with,\" a common preposition.\n\n7. **ahtt**: This is a simple scramble of \"that,\" a common conjunction or pronoun.\n\n8. **hte**: This can be unscrambled to form \"the,\" a common article.\n\n9. **ady**: This can be unscrambled to form \"day,\" a common noun.\n\n10. **s**: This is likely \"is,\" a common verb used in sentences.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"clock answered Mr Smith and with that the day is\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<clock answered Mr Smith and with that the day is>>>"
