    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **dna**: This is likely \"and\".\n2. **psihacyl**: This could be \"physical\".\n3. **efrcos**: This is likely \"forces\".\n4. **penedd**: This could be \"depend\".\n5. **no**: This is \"on\".\n6. **eht**: This is \"the\".\n7. **omde**: This is likely \"mode\".\n8. **fo**: This is \"of\".\n9. **viirnbtoa**: This could be \"vibration\".\n10. **hte**: This is \"the\".\n11. **erheitc**: This could be \"etheric\".\n12. **ptrlicsea**: This could be \"particles\".\n13. **whcih**: This is \"which\".\n14. **si**: This is \"is\".\n15. **fro**: This is \"for\".\n16. **aech**: This is \"each\".\n17. **sceciiafplly**: This could be \"specifically\".\n18. **difrnfeet**: This could be \"different\".\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"And physical forces depend on the mode of vibration of the etheric particles which is for each specifically different.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<And physical forces depend on the mode of vibration of the etheric particles which is for each specifically different.>>>"
