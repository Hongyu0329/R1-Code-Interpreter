    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its most likely correct form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **tinUed**: This is likely \"United\" as it closely resembles the letters and structure of the word.\n2. **Sattes**: This is likely \"States\" as it matches the letters and is a common pairing with \"United.\"\n3. **nad**: This is likely \"and\" as it is a common conjunction and matches the letters.\n4. **oyu**: This is likely \"you\" as it matches the letters and is a common pronoun.\n5. **rae**: This is likely \"are\" as it matches the letters and is a common verb.\n6. **dotecal**: This is likely \"located\" as it matches the letters and fits contextually in the sentence.\n7. **ni**: This is likely \"in\" as it matches the letters and is a common preposition.\n8. **teh**: This is likely \"the\" as it matches the letters and is a common article.\n9. **dniUet**: This is likely \"United\" as it matches the letters and is a repeat of the first word.\n10. **States**: This word is already unscrambled.\n11. **ew**: This is likely \"we\" as it matches the letters and is a common pronoun.\n12. **od**: This is likely \"do\" as it matches the letters and is a common verb.\n13. **ton**: This is likely \"not\" as it matches the letters and is a common adverb.\n14. **cmali**: This is likely \"claim\" as it matches the letters and fits contextually in the sentence.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"United States and you are located in the United States we do not claim\"\n\nFinally, enclosing the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<United States and you are located in the United States we do not claim>>>"
