    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and possible English words. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **rotfh**: This could be \"forth\" or \"froth\". Given the context, \"forth\" is more likely.\n2. **ni**: This is likely \"in\".\n3. **tish**: This is likely \"this\".\n4. **egerenatm**: This is likely \"agreement\".\n5. **uoy**: This is likely \"you\".\n6. **mtus**: This is likely \"must\".\n7. **nboati**: This is likely \"obtain\".\n8. **msrpsoeiin**: This is likely \"permission\".\n9. **ni**: This is likely \"in\".\n10. **wigtnir**: This is likely \"writing\".\n11. **ormf**: This is likely \"from\".\n12. **teh**: This is likely \"the\".\n13. **ePjorct**: This is likely \"Project\".\n14. **nureetGgb**: This is likely \"Gutenberg\".\n15. **Leritary**: This is likely \"Literary\".\n16. **hrAcevi**: This is likely \"Archive\".\n17. **aoundonFti**: This is likely \"Foundation\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence:\n\n<<<forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation>>>"
