    "To unscramble the words in the sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Let's go through each word step by step:\n\n1. **mofr**: \n   - The letters are m, o, f, r.\n   - Possible words include \"form\" and \"from.\"\n   - In the context of planets, \"from\" is more likely.\n\n2. **uecyrrM**:\n   - The letters are u, e, c, y, r, r, M.\n   - The capital 'M' suggests the word is a proper noun, likely a planet.\n   - The correct unscrambled word is \"Mercury.\"\n\n3. **eunVs**:\n   - The letters are e, u, n, V, s.\n   - The capital 'V' suggests the word is a proper noun, likely a planet.\n   - The correct unscrambled word is \"Venus.\"\n\n4. **and**:\n   - The letters are a, n, d.\n   - This is already a correctly spelled word, \"and.\"\n\n5. **raMs**:\n   - The letters are r, a, M, s.\n   - The capital 'M' suggests the word is a proper noun, likely a planet.\n   - The correct unscrambled word is \"Mars.\"\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"from Mercury Venus and Mars\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<from Mercury Venus and Mars>>>"
