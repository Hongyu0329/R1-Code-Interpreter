    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its most likely original form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **nuteGberg**: This is likely \"Gutenberg,\" as it is a well-known name associated with the Gutenberg Project.\n\n2. **Ltreairy**: This could be \"Literary,\" which fits the context of the Gutenberg Project, known for its literary works.\n\n3. **Archeiv**: This is likely \"Archive,\" as the Gutenberg Project is an archive of literary works.\n\n4. **oouidatnFn**: This is likely \"Foundation,\" as the Gutenberg Project is often referred to as the Gutenberg Foundation.\n\n5. **Pcorejt**: This is likely \"Project,\" which is part of the name \"Gutenberg Project.\"\n\n6. **uGterbeng**: This is another scrambled form of \"Gutenberg.\"\n\n7. **edpdnes**: This is likely \"depends,\" a common word that fits grammatically in many sentences.\n\n8. **npou**: This is likely \"upon,\" a preposition that often follows \"depends.\"\n\n9. **nad**: This is likely \"and,\" a common conjunction.\n\n10. **oancnt**: This is likely \"cannot,\" a common word that fits grammatically in many sentences.\n\n11. **serivvu**: This is likely \"survive,\" a verb that fits the context of something depending on something else to survive.\n\n12. **uithowt**: This is likely \"without,\" a preposition that often follows \"cannot survive.\"\n\n13. **rieewpsdad**: This is likely \"widespread,\" an adjective that can describe something that is necessary for survival.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg depends upon and cannot survive without widespread.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg depends upon and cannot survive without widespread.>>>"
