    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **eysa**: This word is likely \"easy\" because it uses all the letters and fits the context of the sentence.\n\n2. **uoY**: This is a simple case of capitalization and is likely \"You\".\n\n3. **mya**: This word is likely \"may\" as it uses all the letters and fits the context.\n\n4. **ues**: This word is likely \"use\" as it uses all the letters and fits the context.\n\n5. **shit**: This word is likely \"this\" as it uses all the letters and fits the context.\n\n6. **eBook**: This word is already correctly spelled and capitalized.\n\n7. **fro**: This word is likely \"for\" as it uses all the letters and fits the context.\n\n8. **nrleay**: This word is likely \"nearly\" as it uses all the letters and fits the context.\n\n9. **ayn**: This word is likely \"any\" as it uses all the letters and fits the context.\n\n10. **puorpse**: This word is likely \"purpose\" as it uses all the letters and fits the context.\n\nNow, putting all the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence, we get:\n\n<<<You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose>>>"
