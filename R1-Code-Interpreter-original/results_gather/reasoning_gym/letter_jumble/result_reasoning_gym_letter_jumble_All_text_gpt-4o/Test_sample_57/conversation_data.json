Your task is to unscramble the words.\n\nThe order of the words in the sentence is preserved. Moreover, the style of the sentence is preserved (i.e. punctuation, capitalization, new lines, etc.).\n\nYour output should be a sentence with the words unscrambled, and enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets, like <<<sentence>>>.\n\nNow, unscramble these words: na troenivn egendni aatipcl nigaa\n",

    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **na**: This is a two-letter word. The most common two-letter words are \"an\" and \"na.\" Given the context, \"an\" is more likely.\n\n2. **troenivn**: This is an eight-letter word. By examining the letters, we can rearrange them to form the word \"invention.\"\n\n3. **egendni**: This is a seven-letter word. By rearranging the letters, we can form the word \"needing.\"\n\n4. **aatipcl**: This is a seven-letter word. By rearranging the letters, we can form the word \"capital.\"\n\n5. **nigaa**: This is a five-letter word. By rearranging the letters, we can form the word \"again.\"\n\nNow, let's put the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n- Original scrambled sentence: \"na troenivn egendni aatipcl nigaa\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"an invention needing capital again\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<an invention needing capital again>>>"
