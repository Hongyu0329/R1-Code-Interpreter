    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its most likely original form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **fI**: This is likely \"If\" since it is capitalized and fits the context of starting a sentence.\n2. **uoy**: This is likely \"you\".\n3. **era**: This is likely \"are\".\n4. **odesiut**: This is likely \"outside\".\n5. **eht**: This is likely \"the\".\n6. **Utined**: This is likely \"United\".\n7. **Statse**: This is likely \"States\".\n8. **ccehk**: This is likely \"check\".\n9. **hte**: This is likely \"the\".\n10. **alws**: This is likely \"laws\".\n11. **fo**: This is likely \"of\".\n12. **rouy**: This is likely \"your\".\n13. **tcunory**: This is likely \"country\".\n14. **ni**: This is likely \"in\".\n15. **andnidiot**: This is likely \"addition\".\n16. **ot**: This is likely \"to\".\n17. **hte**: This is likely \"the\".\n18. **tsrme**: This is likely \"terms\".\n19. **fo**: This is likely \"of\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence:\n\n\"If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of.\"\n\nThe sentence is now unscrambled and should be enclosed in triple angle brackets as per the instructions.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of.>>>"
