    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and possible English words. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **yb**: This is likely \"by\".\n2. **iosnelptCro**: This is likely \"Copernilost\", but that doesn't make sense. Rearranging further, it could be \"Copernicus\", but that doesn't fit the context. It could be \"Percilston\", but that doesn't fit either. The correct word is \"Percilston\", which is a fictional name.\n3. **emti**: This is likely \"time\".\n4. **ouy**: This is likely \"you\".\n5. **neam**: This is likely \"mean\".\n6. **sYe**: This is likely \"Yes\".\n7. **oodG**: This is likely \"Good\".\n8. **tneh**: This is likely \"then\".\n9. **rfo**: This is likely \"for\".\n10. **a**: This is already correct as \"a\".\n11. **tetlli**: This is likely \"little\".\n12. **hielw**: This is likely \"while\".\n13. **idas**: This is likely \"said\".\n14. **rM**: This is likely \"Mr\".\n15. **mtSih**: This is likely \"Smith\".\n16. **sa**: This is likely \"as\".\n17. **eh**: This is likely \"he\".\n18. **ervdees**: This is likely \"deserves\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"by Percilston time you mean Yes Good by then for a little while said Mr Smith as he deserves\"\n\nEnclosing the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<by Percilston time you mean Yes Good by then for a little while said Mr Smith as he deserves>>>"
