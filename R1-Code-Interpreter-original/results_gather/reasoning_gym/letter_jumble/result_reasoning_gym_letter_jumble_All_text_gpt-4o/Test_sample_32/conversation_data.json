    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its most likely original form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **lulf**: This could be \"full\".\n2. **Prcjeot**: This is likely \"Project\".\n3. **Guetnberg**: This is likely \"Gutenberg\".\n4. **eicLnse**: This could be \"License\".\n5. **tusm**: This is likely \"must\".\n6. **rppeaa**: This could be \"appear\".\n7. **yeominrntlp**: This is likely \"prominently\".\n8. **wreneveh**: This could be \"whenever\".\n9. **yna**: This is likely \"any\".\n10. **pocy**: This could be \"copy\".\n11. **fo**: This is likely \"of\".\n12. **a**: This is already unscrambled.\n13. **trojecP**: This is likely \"Project\".\n14. **Gutenbreg**: This is likely \"Gutenberg\".\n15. **wkro**: This could be \"work\".\n16. **yna**: This is likely \"any\".\n17. **wkro**: This could be \"work\".\n18. **no**: This is likely \"on\".\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"Full Project Gutenberg License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg work any work on.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<Full Project Gutenberg License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg work any work on.>>>"
