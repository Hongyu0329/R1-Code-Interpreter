    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **eDfects**: The capital 'D' suggests this is the first word of the sentence. The letters can be rearranged to form \"Defects\".\n\n2. **suhc**: This can be rearranged to form \"such\".\n\n3. **sa**: This is already unscrambled as \"as\".\n\n4. **btu**: This can be rearranged to form \"but\".\n\n5. **nto**: This can be rearranged to form \"not\".\n\n6. **ldmitei**: This can be rearranged to form \"limited\".\n\n7. **ot**: This is already unscrambled as \"to\".\n\n8. **itcomplene**: This can be rearranged to form \"incomplete\".\n\n9. **iuaccnrate**: This can be rearranged to form \"inaccurate\".\n\n10. **ro**: This can be rearranged to form \"or\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"Defects such as but not limited to incomplete inaccurate or\"\n\nFinally, enclosing the sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<Defects such as but not limited to incomplete inaccurate or>>>"
