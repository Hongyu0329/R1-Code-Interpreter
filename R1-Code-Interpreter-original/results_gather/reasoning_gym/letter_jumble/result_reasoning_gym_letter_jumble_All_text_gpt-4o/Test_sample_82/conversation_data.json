    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **fo**: This is likely \"of\" as it is a common two-letter word.\n2. **wodo**: This could be \"wood\" as it is a common four-letter word that fits the context.\n3. **eThy**: The capitalization suggests it is a proper noun or the start of a sentence. It unscrambles to \"They\".\n4. **era**: This unscrambles to \"are\", a common verb.\n5. **onw**: This unscrambles to \"now\", a common adverb.\n6. **ngylaipp**: This is likely \"playing\", a verb that fits the context.\n7. **hate**: This unscrambles to \"heat\", a noun that fits the context.\n8. **nwo**: This unscrambles to \"own\", a verb that fits the context.\n9. **eeritciyctl**: This is likely \"electricity\", a noun that fits the context.\n10. **oN**: The capitalization suggests it is the start of a sentence or a standalone word. It unscrambles to \"No\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n- Original scrambled sentence: \"fo wodo eThy era onw ngylaipp hate nwo eeritciyctl oN\"\n- Unscrambled sentence: \"of wood They are now playing heat own electricity No\"\n\nFinally, enclosing the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<of wood They are now playing heat own electricity No>>>"
