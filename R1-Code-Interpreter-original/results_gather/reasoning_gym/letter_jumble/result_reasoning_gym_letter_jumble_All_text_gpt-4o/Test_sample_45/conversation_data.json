    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **osrts**: This could be \"sorts\" as it is a common word that fits the letter pattern.\n2. **fo**: This is likely \"of\" as it is a common preposition.\n3. **deshsi**: This could be \"dishes\" as it fits the letter pattern and makes sense contextually.\n4. **sa**: This is likely \"as\" since it is a common conjunction.\n5. **a**: This is already unscrambled as \"a\".\n6. **idrvea**: This could be \"varied\" as it fits the letter pattern and makes sense in context.\n7. **astorsnemt**: This could be \"assortment\" as it fits the letter pattern and makes sense contextually.\n8. **si**: This is likely \"is\" as it is a common verb.\n9. **aswyal**: This could be \"always\" as it fits the letter pattern and makes sense in context.\n10. **ni**: This is likely \"in\" as it is a common preposition.\n11. **rsaeinesd**: This could be \"readiness\" as it fits the letter pattern and makes sense contextually.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence, we get:\n\n<<<sorts of dishes as a varied assortment is always in readiness>>>"
