    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context and the letters available. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **tse**: This could be \"set\" or \"est\". Given the context, \"set\" is more likely.\n2. **orf**: This is likely \"for\".\n3. **shi**: This is likely \"his\".\n4. **reoirtncuesr**: This is likely \"reconstruction\".\n5. **ti**: This is likely \"it\".\n6. **swa**: This is likely \"was\".\n7. **poposrde**: This is likely \"proposed\".\n8. **ot**: This is likely \"to\".\n9. **rM**: This is likely \"Mr\".\n10. **hSmti**: This is likely \"Smith\".\n11. **ttah**: This is likely \"that\".\n12. **eh**: This is likely \"he\".\n13. **ohsudl**: This is likely \"should\".\n14. **rpmiet**: This is likely \"permit\".\n15. **eth**: This is likely \"the\".\n16. **snecdo**: This is likely \"second\".\n17. **tpar**: This is likely \"part\".\n18. **fo**: This is likely \"of\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence:\n\n<<<set for his reconstruction it was proposed to Mr Smith that he should permit the second part of>>>"
