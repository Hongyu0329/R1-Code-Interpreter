    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to analyze each word individually and attempt to rearrange the letters to form a meaningful word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Utiedn**: This word can be rearranged to form \"United\".\n2. **tteaSs**: This word can be rearranged to form \"States\".\n3. **wtthoiu**: This word can be rearranged to form \"without\".\n4. **erpmisinos**: This word can be rearranged to form \"permission\".\n5. **dna**: This word can be rearranged to form \"and\".\n6. **iwtohut**: This word can be rearranged to form \"without\".\n7. **ngiypa**: This word can be rearranged to form \"paying\".\n\nNow, let's put the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the original order and style:\n\n\"United States without permission and without paying\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<United States without permission and without paying>>>"
