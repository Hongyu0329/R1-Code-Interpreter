    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine its most likely original form. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **sa**: This is likely \"as,\" a common two-letter word.\n2. **amn**: This could be \"man,\" a common three-letter word.\n3. **himself**: This word is already unscrambled.\n4. **rtecleicity**: This is likely \"electricity,\" a word that fits the context and has the same letters.\n5. **aws**: This is likely \"was,\" a common three-letter word.\n6. **knwon**: This is likely \"known,\" a word that fits the context and has the same letters.\n7. **reays**: This is likely \"years,\" a word that fits the context and has the same letters.\n8. **aog**: This is likely \"ago,\" a common three-letter word.\n9. **nad**: This is likely \"and,\" a common three-letter word.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the sentence with the unscrambled words:\n\n\"As a man himself electricity was known years ago and.\"\n\nFinally, we enclose the sentence in triple angle brackets as instructed:\n\n<<<As a man himself electricity was known years ago and>>>"
