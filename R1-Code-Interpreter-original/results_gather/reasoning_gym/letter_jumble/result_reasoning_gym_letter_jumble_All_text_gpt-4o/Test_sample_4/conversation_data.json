    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely correct word based on the context of the sentence. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **rohses**: This word is likely \"horses\" because it fits the context of transportation and is a common word.\n\n2. **rewe**: This is likely \"were,\" a common verb that fits grammatically in the sentence.\n\n3. **eht**: This is a common scrambling of \"the.\"\n\n4. **oyln**: This is likely \"only,\" which makes sense in the context of describing a singular means of conveyance.\n\n5. **menas**: This is likely \"means,\" which fits the context of transportation.\n\n6. **fo**: This is \"of,\" a common preposition.\n\n7. **conveyenca**: This is likely \"conveyance,\" which is a term for a mode of transportation.\n\n8. **Thikn**: This is likely \"Think,\" which fits the context and maintains the capitalization.\n\n9. **fo**: This is \"of,\" a common preposition.\n\n10. **hte**: This is a common scrambling of \"the.\"\n\n11. **rialroads**: This is likely \"railroads,\" which fits the context of transportation.\n\n12. **fo**: This is \"of,\" a common preposition.\n\n13. **teh**: This is a common scrambling of \"the.\"\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n<<<Horses were the only means of conveyance.
