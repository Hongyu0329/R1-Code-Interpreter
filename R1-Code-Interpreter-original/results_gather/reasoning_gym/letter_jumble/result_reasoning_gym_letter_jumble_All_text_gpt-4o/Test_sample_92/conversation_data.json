    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to carefully analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **redapmtent**: This word can be rearranged to form \"department\".\n2. **eh**: This is likely \"he\".\n3. **ofudn**: This can be rearranged to form \"found\".\n4. **eht**: This is likely \"the\".\n5. **oprtoaers**: This can be rearranged to form \"operators\".\n6. **istnigt**: This can be rearranged to form \"sitting\".\n7. **hwti**: This is likely \"with\".\n8. **ofledd**: This can be rearranged to form \"folded\".\n9. **samr**: This can be rearranged to form \"arms\".\n10. **ta**: This is likely \"at\".\n11. **thire**: This can be rearranged to form \"their\".\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"department he found the operators sitting with folded arms at their\"\n\nFinally, enclosing the unscrambled sentence in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<department he found the operators sitting with folded arms at their>>>"
