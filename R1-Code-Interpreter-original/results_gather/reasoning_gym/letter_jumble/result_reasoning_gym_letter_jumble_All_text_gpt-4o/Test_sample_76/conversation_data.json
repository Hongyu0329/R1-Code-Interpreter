    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **si**: This is a two-letter word. The most common two-letter words are \"is,\" \"in,\" \"it,\" \"on,\" etc. Given the context, \"is\" seems to be the most appropriate unscrambled word.\n\n2. **ilstl**: This is a five-letter word. Possible words include \"still,\" \"tills,\" \"slilt,\" etc. \"Still\" is a common word that fits well in a sentence, so it is likely the correct unscrambled word.\n\n3. **ni**: This is a two-letter word. The most common two-letter words are \"in,\" \"on,\" \"it,\" etc. Given the context, \"in\" seems to be the most appropriate unscrambled word.\n\n4. **the**: This is a three-letter word. The letters are already in the correct order, so the word is \"the.\"\n\n5. **ufrtue**: This is a six-letter word. Possible words include \"future,\" \"refute,\" etc. \"Future\" is a common word that fits well in a sentence, so it is likely the correct unscrambled word.\n\n6. **tbu**: This is a three-letter word. Possible words include \"but,\" \"tub,\" etc. \"But\" is a common conjunction that fits well in a sentence, so it is likely the correct unscrambled word.\n\n7. **ni**: This is a two-letter word. The most common two-letter words are \"in,\" \"on,\" \"it,\" etc. Given the context, \"in\" seems to be the most appropriate unscrambled word.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words back into the sentence while preserving the order and style:\n\n\"si ilstl ni the ufrtue tbu ni\" becomes \"is still in the future but in.\"\n\nThe final unscrambled sentence is:\n\n<<<is still in the future but in>>>"
