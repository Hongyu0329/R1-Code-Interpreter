    "To unscramble the words in the given sentence, we need to analyze each scrambled word and determine the most likely original word. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **grastn**: This word can be rearranged to form \"strang,\" but that is not a valid English word. The correct unscrambled word is \"strang,\" which is a part of the word \"stranger.\"\n\n2. **ot**: This is a simple two-letter word that can be unscrambled to \"to.\"\n\n3. **calrels**: This word can be rearranged to form \"recalls,\" which is a valid English word.\n\n4. **enO**: This is a three-letter word with a capital letter at the beginning, indicating it is likely a proper noun or the start of a sentence. The correct unscrambled word is \"One.\"\n\n5. **realidy**: This word can be rearranged to form \"readily,\" which is a valid English word.\n\n6. **undersnatds**: This word can be rearranged to form \"understands,\" which is a valid English word.\n\n7. **how**: This is already a valid English word and does not need to be unscrambled.\n\n8. **a**: This is already a valid English word and does not need to be unscrambled.\n\n9. **nam**: This word can be rearranged to form \"man,\" which is a valid English word.\n\nNow, putting the unscrambled words together while preserving the order and style of the sentence, we get:\n\n<<<Strang to recalls One readily understands how a man>>>"
