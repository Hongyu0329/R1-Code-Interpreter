Let's work through each word:\n\n1. \"fsee\" -> \"fees\"\n2. \"ot\" -> \"to\"\n3. \"mete\" -> \"meet\"\n4. \"nad\" -> \"and\"\n5. \"eekp\" -> \"keep\"\n6. \"pu\" -> \"up\"\n7. \"wtih\" -> \"with\"\n8. \"shete\" -> \"these\"\n9. \"risueremqnte\" -> \"requirements\"\n10. \"eW\" -> \"We\"\n11. \"od\" -> \"do\"\n12. \"nto\" -> \"not\"\n13. \"sclioti\" -> \"solicit\"\n14. \"donotiasn\" -> \"donations\"\n15. \"ni\" -> \"in\"\n16. \"iocaltons\" -> \"locations\"\n\nNow, let's construct the unscrambled sentence:\n\n<<<fees to meet and keep up with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations>>>"
