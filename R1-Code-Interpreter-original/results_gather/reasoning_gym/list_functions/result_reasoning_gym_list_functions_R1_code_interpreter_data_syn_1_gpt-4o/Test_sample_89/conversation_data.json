    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input sequence to the output. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. In Example 1, the sequence is [75, 150, 300, 600], and the output is [1200]. Each number in the sequence is doubled to get the next number, and the output is the next number in the sequence, which is 600 * 2 = 1200.\n\n2. In Example 2, the sequence is [43, 86, 172, 344, 688], and the output is [1376]. Similarly, each number is doubled to get the next number, and the output is 688 * 2 = 1376.\n\n3. In Example 3, the sequence is [61, 122, 244, 488, 976, 1952, 3904, 7808, 15616], and the output is [31232]. Again, each number is doubled, and the output is 15616 * 2 = 31232.\n\n4. In Example 4, the sequence is [68, 136, 272, 544, 1088, 2176, 4352, 8704], and the output is [17408]. Each number is doubled, and the output is 8704 * 2 = 17408.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce that the rule is to double the last number in the sequence to get the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input [42, 84, 168, 336, 672]:\n\n- The last number in the sequence is 672.\n- According to the rule, we double this number to get the output.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given input sequence\nsequence = [42, 84, 168, 336, 672]\n\n# Get the last number in the sequence\nlast_number = sequence[-1]\n\n# Calculate the output by doubling the last number\noutput = last_number * 2\n\n# Print the output\nprint([output])\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the output by doubling the last number in the sequence and print the result. Let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output [1344]. This confirms that the pattern of doubling the last number in the sequence holds true for the given input.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the input [42, 84, 168, 336, 672] is:\n\n<<<[1344]>>>"
