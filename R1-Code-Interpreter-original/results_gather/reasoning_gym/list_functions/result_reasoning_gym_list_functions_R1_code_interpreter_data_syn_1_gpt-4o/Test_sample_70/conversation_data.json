    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [87, 79, 46, 22, 71]\n   - Output: [22]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [50, 38, 80, 55, 73]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The output is 0, which is not present in the list. This suggests a different rule might apply when no specific condition is met.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [93, 68, 70]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: Again, the output is 0, indicating a similar rule as Example 2.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [95, 49, 57, 30, 66]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The output is 0, consistent with Examples 2 and 3.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule might be:\n- If the smallest number in the list is less than or equal to 25, return that number.\n- Otherwise, return [0].\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input [11, 7, 89, 24, 78]:\n\n- The smallest number in the list is 7, which is less than 25.\n\nTherefore, according to the rule, the output should be [7].\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a Python script to automate the process:\n\n```python\ndef find_output(input_list):\n    smallest = min(input_list)\n    if smallest <= 25:\n        return [smallest]\n    else:\n        return [0]\n\ninput_list = [11, 7, 89, 24, 78]\noutput = find_output(input_list)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the output based on the identified rule.",
    "The code output [7] confirms our reasoning. The smallest number in the input list [11, 7, 89, 24, 78] is 7, which is less than 25. Therefore, according to the rule we deduced, the output should be [7].\n\n<<<[7]>>>"
