    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [45, 53, 15, 42] -> Output: [46, 53, 15, 43]\n2. Input: [88, 6, 98] -> Output: [89, 6, 99]\n3. Input: [20, 59, 94, 6, 81, 70, 65] -> Output: [21, 59, 94, 6, 81, 70, 66]\n4. Input: [78, 37, 74, 48, 52, 4] -> Output: [79, 37, 74, 48, 52, 5]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n- The first and the last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n- The other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input list [93, 18, 13, 55, 94, 49].\n\nTo verify and implement this pattern, we can write a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef transform_list(input_list):\n    if len(input_list) > 1:\n        input_list[0] += 1\n        input_list[-1] += 1\n    return input_list\n\noutput = transform_list([93, 18, 13, 55, 94, 49])\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the output [94, 18, 13, 55, 94, 50]. This matches the pattern we identified, where the first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1, and the other elements remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the input [93, 18, 13, 55, 94, 49] is:\n\n<<<[94, 18, 13, 55, 94, 50]>>>"
