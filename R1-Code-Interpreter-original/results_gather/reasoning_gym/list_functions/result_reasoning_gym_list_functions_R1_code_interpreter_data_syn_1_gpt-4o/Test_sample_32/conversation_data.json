    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output list in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [16, 81, 79, 52, 69, 88, 3, 27, 35, 91]\n   - Output: [79, 69]\n   - Observation: The output contains numbers that are prime.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [90, 100, 84, 19, 11, 54]\n   - Output: [90, 100, 11]\n   - Observation: The output contains numbers that are either perfect squares or prime.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [26, 93, 4, 11, 52, 87, 1, 9, 23, 14]\n   - Output: [93, 11, 23]\n   - Observation: The output contains numbers that are prime.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [76, 34, 29]\n   - Output: [76]\n   - Observation: The output contains numbers that are perfect squares.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule involves selecting numbers that are either prime or perfect squares. However, the examples show some inconsistency, particularly with perfect squares. Let's focus on identifying prime numbers as a consistent rule.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input list: [12, 4, 99, 59, 51, 28].\n\nWe'll write a Python script to identify the prime numbers in the list.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ninput_list = [12, 4, 99, 59, 51, 28]\noutput_list = [x for x in input_list if is_prime(x)]\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the prime numbers in the input list.",
    "Based on the code output, the only prime number in the input list [12, 4, 99, 59, 51, 28] is 59. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[59]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
