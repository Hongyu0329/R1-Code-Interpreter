    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input list into the output list. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Example 1: \n   - Input: [74, 77, 59]\n   - Output: [74, 78, 61]\n   - Observations: \n     - The first element remains the same.\n     - The second element increases by 1.\n     - The third element increases by 2.\n\n2. Example 2:\n   - Input: [83, 23, 61, 61, 30, 21]\n   - Output: [83, 24, 63, 64, 34, 26]\n   - Observations:\n     - The first element remains the same.\n     - The second element increases by 1.\n     - The third element increases by 2.\n     - The fourth element increases by 3.\n     - The fifth element increases by 4.\n     - The sixth element increases by 5.\n\n3. Example 3:\n   - Input: [81, 63, 12, 95, 87]\n   - Output: [81, 64, 14, 98, 91]\n   - Observations:\n     - The first element remains the same.\n     - The second element increases by 1.\n     - The third element increases by 2.\n     - The fourth element increases by 3.\n     - The fifth element increases by 4.\n\n4. Example 4:\n   - Input: [69, 19, 46, 26, 98, 64, 50]\n   - Output: [69, 20, 48, 29, 102, 69, 56]\n   - Observations:\n     - The first element remains the same.\n     - The second element increases by 1.\n     - The third element increases by 2.\n     - The fourth element increases by 3.\n     - The fifth element increases by 4.\n     - The sixth element increases by 5.\n     - The seventh element increases by 6.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the rule: \n- The first element remains unchanged.\n- Each subsequent element increases by an incrementing integer starting from 1.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the input [54, 53, 36]:\n\n- The first element remains the same: 54\n- The second element increases by 1: 53 + 1 = 54\n- The third element increases by 2: 36 + 2 = 38\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify:\n\n```python\ndef transform_list(input_list):\n    output_list = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(input_list):\n        if i == 0:\n            output_list.append(num)\n        else:\n            output_list.append(num + i)\n    return output_list\n\ninput_data = [54, 53, 36]\noutput_data = transform_list(input_data)\nprint(output_data)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the transformed list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches our expectations based on the identified pattern. The transformation applied to the input list [54, 53, 36] results in the output list [54, 54, 38].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[54, 54, 38]>>>"
