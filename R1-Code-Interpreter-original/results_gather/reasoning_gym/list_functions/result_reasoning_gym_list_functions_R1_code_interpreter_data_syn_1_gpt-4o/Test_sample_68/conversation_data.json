    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output list in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [59, 59, 99, 23, 91]\n   - Output: [5]\n   - Observation: The output is the number of elements in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [94, 45, 56, 65, 15, 69, 16, 11, 95]\n   - Output: [9]\n   - Observation: The output is the number of elements in the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [34, 7, 85, 83, 27, 43, 30, 40, 99, 27]\n   - Output: [10]\n   - Observation: The output is the number of elements in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [19, 25, 45, 48, 81]\n   - Output: [5]\n   - Observation: The output is the number of elements in the input list.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule is to count the number of elements in the input list and return that count as the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- Input: [27, 52, 60, 72, 36, 49, 21, 84, 82]\n\nWe will count the number of elements in this list.\n\n```python\n# Count the number of elements in the input list\ninput_list = [27, 52, 60, 72, 36, 49, 21, 84, 82]\noutput = [len(input_list)]\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code will count the number of elements in the input list and print the result. Let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `[9]`, which is the count of elements in the input list `[27, 52, 60, 72, 36, 49, 21, 84, 82]`. This matches the pattern observed in the examples, where the output is the number of elements in the input list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[9]>>>"
