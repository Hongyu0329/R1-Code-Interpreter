    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input 1: 55 -> Output 1: 106\n2. Input 2: 96 -> Output 2: 188\n3. Input 3: 82 -> Output 3: 160\n4. Input 4: 24 -> Output 4: 44\n\nLet's try to find a mathematical relationship between each input and its corresponding output. \n\n- For Input 1: 55 to Output 1: 106\n  - 106 is approximately double 55, minus a small constant.\n  \n- For Input 2: 96 to Output 2: 188\n  - 188 is approximately double 96, minus a small constant.\n  \n- For Input 3: 82 to Output 3: 160\n  - 160 is approximately double 82, minus a small constant.\n  \n- For Input 4: 24 to Output 4: 44\n  - 44 is approximately double 24, minus a small constant.\n\nIt seems like the output is roughly double the input, minus a small constant. Let's calculate the exact relationship using Python code to determine the pattern.\n\n```python\ndef find_pattern(input_list, output_list):\n    differences = []\n    for i, o in zip(input_list, output_list):\n        differences.append(o - 2 * i)\n    return differences\n\ninput_examples = [55, 96, 82, 24]\noutput_examples = [106, 188, 160, 44]\n\npattern = find_pattern(input_examples, output_examples)\nprint(pattern)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the pattern.",
    "The code output indicates that the pattern involves doubling the input and then subtracting 4 to get the output. This is consistent across all the examples provided. Therefore, the rule can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times \\text{Input} - 4 \\]\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input, which is 31.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_output(input_value):\n    return 2 * input_value - 4\n\ninput_value = 31\noutput_value = calculate_output(input_value)\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output for the input 31.",
    "The code output indicates that when applying the rule \\( \\text{Output} = 2 \\times \\text{Input} - 4 \\) to the input 31, the result is 58.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [31] is:\n\n<<<58>>>"
