    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input list into the output list. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [60, 50, 26, 39, 7, 54, 31, 37]\n   - Output: [60, 51, 28, 42, 11, 59, 37, 44]\n   \n   Observations:\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element increases by 1.\n   - The third element increases by 2.\n   - The fourth element increases by 3.\n   - The fifth element increases by 4.\n   - The sixth element increases by 5.\n   - The seventh element increases by 6.\n   - The eighth element increases by 7.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [97, 57, 63, 30, 11, 43, 39]\n   - Output: [97, 58, 65, 33, 15, 48, 45]\n   \n   Observations:\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element increases by 1.\n   - The third element increases by 2.\n   - The fourth element increases by 3.\n   - The fifth element increases by 4.\n   - The sixth element increases by 5.\n   - The seventh element increases by 6.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [43, 69, 8, 1, 85, 53]\n   - Output: [43, 70, 10, 4, 89, 58]\n   \n   Observations:\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element increases by 1.\n   - The third element increases by 2.\n   - The fourth element increases by 3.\n   - The fifth element increases by 4.\n   - The sixth element increases by 5.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [96, 31, 43, 70, 59, 4, 9, 85, 81]\n   - Output: [96, 32, 45, 73, 63, 9, 15, 92, 89]\n   \n   Observations:\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element increases by 1.\n   - The third element increases by 2.\n   - The fourth element increases by 3.\n   - The fifth element increases by 4.\n   - The sixth element increases by 5.\n   - The seventh element increases by 6.\n   - The eighth element increases by 7.\n   - The ninth element increases by 8.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that each element in the list is increased by its index (starting from 0) in the list. The first element remains unchanged, the second element is increased by 1, the third by 2, and so on.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input list: [20, 13, 32, 82, 98, 83, 12, 95, 92].\n\nWe'll write a Python script to apply this transformation:\n\n```python\ninput_list = [20, 13, 32, 82, 98, 83, 12, 95, 92]\noutput_list = [x + i for i, x in enumerate(input_list)]\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output list by applying the transformation rule we deduced. Each element in the input list was increased by its index position, resulting in the output list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the given input [20, 13, 32, 82, 98, 83, 12, 95, 92] is:\n\n<<<[20, 14, 34, 85, 102, 88, 18, 102, 100]>>>"
