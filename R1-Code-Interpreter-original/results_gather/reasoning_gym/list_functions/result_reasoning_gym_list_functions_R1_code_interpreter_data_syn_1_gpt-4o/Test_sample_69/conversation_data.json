    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output list in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [70, 46, 60, 7, 85, 65]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - The output is the length of the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [78, 29, 37, 63, 89, 28]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - The output is the length of the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [57, 10, 33, 25, 21, 12, 57, 99]\n   - Output: [8]\n   - The output is the length of the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [25, 61, 42, 31, 82, 52, 55, 27]\n   - Output: [8]\n   - The output is the length of the input list.\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the output is simply the length of the input list. Let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **New Input: [56, 60, 39, 28]**\n  - The length of this list is 4.\n\nTherefore, the output should be [4]. Let's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to compute the length of the input list.\n\n```python\ninput_list = [56, 60, 39, 28]\noutput = [len(input_list)]\nprint(output)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the output. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[4]>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the expected output, which confirms our reasoning. The output is the length of the input list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<[4]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
