    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input numbers to the output numbers. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. Input: 845 -> Output: 0\n2. Input: 460 -> Output: 1\n3. Input: 3955 -> Output: 0\n4. Input: 740 -> Output: 1\n\nWe need to determine what characteristic or property of the input numbers results in the given output. \n\nOne possible approach is to check if the output is related to some property of the number, such as divisibility, parity, or digit sum. Let's explore these possibilities:\n\n- **Divisibility**: Check if the number is divisible by a certain number.\n- **Parity**: Check if the number is odd or even.\n- **Digit Sum**: Check if the sum of the digits of the number has a certain property.\n\nLet's start by checking the parity of the numbers, as it is a simple property to verify:\n\n- 845 is odd -> Output: 0\n- 460 is even -> Output: 1\n- 3955 is odd -> Output: 0\n- 740 is even -> Output: 1\n\nIt seems that the output is 0 for odd numbers and 1 for even numbers. Let's verify this hypothesis with the input 4105.\n\n```python\n# Check if the number is odd or even\nnumber = 4105\noutput = 0 if number % 2 != 0 else 1\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify our hypothesis.",
    "The code output indicates that the number 4105 is odd, which aligns with our hypothesis that the output is 0 for odd numbers and 1 for even numbers. Therefore, the rule that maps the input to the output is based on the parity of the number.\n\nGiven this understanding, the output for the input [4105] is:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
