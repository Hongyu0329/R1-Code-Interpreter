    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps each input list to its corresponding output list. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [99, 78, 91, 34]\n   - Output: [99, 79, 93, 37]\n   - Observation: Each element in the output is slightly larger than the corresponding element in the input. Specifically, the differences are [0, +1, +2, +3].\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [45, 9, 20, 54, 43]\n   - Output: [45, 10, 22, 57, 47]\n   - Observation: The differences are [0, +1, +2, +3, +4].\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [39, 89, 88, 43, 10, 74]\n   - Output: [39, 90, 90, 46, 14, 79]\n   - Observation: The differences are [0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5].\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [60, 80, 1, 29, 19]\n   - Output: [60, 81, 3, 32, 23]\n   - Observation: The differences are [0, +1, +2, +3, +4].\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule is to add an incrementing integer starting from 0 to each element of the input list. The increment is based on the position of the element in the list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input list: [7, 72, 42, 94, 12, 10, 53, 61, 11, 52].\n\nWe'll write a Python script to apply this rule and generate the output list.\n\n```python\ninput_list = [7, 72, 42, 94, 12, 10, 53, 61, 11, 52]\noutput_list = [x + i for i, x in enumerate(input_list)]\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output list by applying the identified pattern. Each element in the input list was incremented by its index position, resulting in the output list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the given input is:\n\n<<<[7, 73, 44, 97, 16, 15, 59, 68, 19, 61]>>>"
