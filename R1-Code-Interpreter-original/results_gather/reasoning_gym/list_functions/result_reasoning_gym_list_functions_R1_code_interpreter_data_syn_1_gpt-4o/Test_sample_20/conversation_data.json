    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: 93, Output: 182\n2. Input: 53, Output: 102\n3. Input: 70, Output: 136\n4. Input: 22, Output: 40\n\nLet's try to find a mathematical relationship between the input and output values. \n\n- For Input 1: 93 to Output 1: 182\n  - 182 is approximately double of 93, but not exactly. Let's calculate: 93 * 2 = 186, which is close to 182. The difference is 4.\n\n- For Input 2: 53 to Output 2: 102\n  - 102 is approximately double of 53. Let's calculate: 53 * 2 = 106, which is close to 102. The difference is 4.\n\n- For Input 3: 70 to Output 3: 136\n  - 136 is approximately double of 70. Let's calculate: 70 * 2 = 140, which is close to 136. The difference is 4.\n\n- For Input 4: 22 to Output 4: 40\n  - 40 is approximately double of 22. Let's calculate: 22 * 2 = 44, which is close to 40. The difference is 4.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can deduce that the rule is to double the input and then subtract 4 to get the output.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input, 80.\n\n```python\n# Applying the deduced rule: double the input and subtract 4\ninput_value = 80\noutput_value = (input_value * 2) - 4\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the output for the input 80.",
    "Based on the code execution, the output for the input 80 is 156. This confirms that the rule we deduced (double the input and subtract 4) is consistent with the given examples.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[156]>>>"
