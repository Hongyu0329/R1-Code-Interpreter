    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [41, 16, 40, 24]\n   - Output: [41, 16, 40]\n   - Observation: The output includes numbers that are either prime or have a digit sum that is a prime number.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [45, 16, 57, 59, 68, 36]\n   - Output: [45, 59, 68]\n   - Observation: The output includes numbers that are either prime or have a digit sum that is a prime number.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [22, 41, 36, 65, 80, 1, 89, 66, 6, 17]\n   - Output: [41, 65, 89, 66]\n   - Observation: The output includes numbers that are either prime or have a digit sum that is a prime number.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [57, 20, 77, 54, 31, 35]\n   - Output: [57, 77]\n   - Observation: The output includes numbers that are either prime or have a digit sum that is a prime number.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule involves selecting numbers that are either prime or have a digit sum that is a prime number.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input: [85, 56, 1, 71, 26, 85, 21].\n\nWe'll write a Python script to identify numbers that are either prime or have a digit sum that is a prime number.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef digit_sum(n):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))\n\ndef filter_numbers(numbers):\n    result = []\n    for number in numbers:\n        if is_prime(number) or is_prime(digit_sum(number)):\n            result.append(number)\n    return result\n\ninput_numbers = [85, 56, 1, 71, 26, 85, 21]\noutput_numbers = filter_numbers(input_numbers)\nprint(output_numbers)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output for the given input.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the output list: [85, 56, 71, 85, 21]. This list includes numbers from the input that are either prime or have a digit sum that is a prime number.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer based on this output.\n\n<<<[85, 56, 71, 85, 21]>>>"
