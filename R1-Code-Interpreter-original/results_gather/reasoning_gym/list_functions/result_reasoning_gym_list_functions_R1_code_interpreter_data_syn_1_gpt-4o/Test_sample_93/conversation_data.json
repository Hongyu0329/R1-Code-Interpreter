    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [29, 77, 39, 73, 95, 24] -> Output: [24, 95, 73, 39, 77, 29]\n2. Input: [20, 78, 40, 79, 81, 1, 10, 91] -> Output: [91, 10, 1, 81, 79, 40, 78, 20]\n3. Input: [61, 65, 86, 54, 82] -> Output: [82, 54, 86, 65, 61]\n4. Input: [97, 33, 38, 21] -> Output: [21, 38, 33, 97]\n\nObservations:\n- The output list seems to be a rearrangement of the input list.\n- The output list is not simply the reverse of the input list.\n- The output list appears to be sorted in a specific order, but not strictly ascending or descending.\n\nLet's try to deduce the pattern:\n- In each example, the output list starts with the smallest number from the input list.\n- The next number in the output list is the largest number from the remaining numbers in the input list.\n- This pattern alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.\n\nTo confirm this pattern, let's apply it to the given input: [24, 63, 19, 7, 36, 91, 78, 81, 69, 55].\n\nWe'll write a Python script to implement this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef rearrange_list(input_list):\n    result = []\n    input_list.sort()\n    while input_list:\n        result.append(input_list.pop(0))  # Smallest\n        if input_list:\n            result.append(input_list.pop(-1))  # Largest\n    return result\n\ninput_list = [24, 63, 19, 7, 36, 91, 78, 81, 69, 55]\noutput_list = rearrange_list(input_list)\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output for the given input.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output list [7, 91, 19, 81, 24, 78, 36, 69, 55, 63]. This output follows the pattern we identified: starting with the smallest number, then the largest, and alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer based on this output.\n\n<<<[7, 91, 19, 81, 24, 78, 36, 69, 55, 63]>>>"
