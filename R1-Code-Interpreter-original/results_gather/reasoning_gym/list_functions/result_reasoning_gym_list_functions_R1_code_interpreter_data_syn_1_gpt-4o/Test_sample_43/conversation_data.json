    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output list in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: \n   - Input: [66, 75, 5, 59, 6, 86, 61, 5, 87, 5, 94, 5, 99, 5, 56, 5]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - Observation: The number 5 appears multiple times, and the number 6 appears once. The output is the index of the first occurrence of the number 6.\n\n2. **Example 2**: \n   - Input: [88, 17, 26, 70, 60, 74, 19, 26, 87]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: No number appears more than once. The output is 0, which could indicate the index of the first element.\n\n3. **Example 3**: \n   - Input: [42, 35, 5, 25, 8]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: No number appears more than once. The output is 1, which is the index of the second element.\n\n4. **Example 4**: \n   - Input: [15, 38, 60, 67, 73, 87, 38, 84]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 38 appears twice, but the output is 0, which is the index of the first element.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the output is determined by the index of the first occurrence of a number that appears more than once. If no number appears more than once, the output is the index of the first element.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the given input: [5, 38, 5, 5, 68, 71, 71, 3, 100, 5, 21, 57].\n\n- The number 5 appears multiple times, and its first occurrence is at index 0.\n- The number 71 also appears multiple times, but its first occurrence is at index 5.\n\nSince 5 appears first, the output should be the index of its first occurrence, which is 0.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a Python script to find the index of the first occurrence of a number that appears more than once.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_repeated_index(lst):\n    seen = {}\n    for index, value in enumerate(lst):\n        if value in seen:\n            return seen[value]\n        seen[value] = index\n    return 0\n\ninput_list = [5, 38, 5, 5, 68, 71, 71, 3, 100, 5, 21, 57]\noutput = find_first_repeated_index(input_list)\nprint([output])\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `[0]`, which matches our reasoning. Therefore, the index of the first occurrence of a number that appears more than once in the input list is 0.\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
