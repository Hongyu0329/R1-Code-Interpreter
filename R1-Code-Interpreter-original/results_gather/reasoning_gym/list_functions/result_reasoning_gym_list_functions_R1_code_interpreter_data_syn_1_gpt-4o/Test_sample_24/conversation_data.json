    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: 84, Output: 164\n2. Input: 48, Output: 92\n3. Input: 98, Output: 192\n4. Input: 88, Output: 172\n\nWe can observe the following:\n\n- For Input 84, the Output is 164. The difference is 164 - 84 = 80.\n- For Input 48, the Output is 92. The difference is 92 - 48 = 44.\n- For Input 98, the Output is 192. The difference is 192 - 98 = 94.\n- For Input 88, the Output is 172. The difference is 172 - 88 = 84.\n\nThe differences are 80, 44, 94, and 84 respectively. Let's see if there's a consistent pattern or formula that can be applied to the input to get the output.\n\nOne possible approach is to check if the output is approximately double the input, as the differences are relatively close to the input values. Let's calculate the output as double the input and see if it matches or is close to the given outputs.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the output based on the input\ndef calculate_output(input_value):\n    # Calculate the output as double the input\n    output_value = 2 * input_value\n    return output_value\n\n# Test the function with the given input\ninput_value = 72\noutput_value = calculate_output(input_value)\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code output of 144 suggests that doubling the input value of 72 results in 144. However, this does not match the pattern observed in the examples provided. Let's refine our approach to better match the pattern.\n\nUpon further inspection, it seems that the output is not simply double the input. Instead, the differences between the input and output values in the examples are not consistent, but they are close to the input values. Let's try a different approach by examining the differences more closely.\n\nLet's calculate the differences between the input and output for each example and see if there's a consistent pattern or formula that can be applied to the input to get the output.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the output based on the input\ndef calculate_output(input_value):\n    # Calculate the output using a pattern observed from the examples\n    # The pattern seems to be adding a certain value to the input\n    # Let's try adding 80 to the input as a hypothesis\n    output_value = input_value + 80\n    return output_value\n\n# Test the function with the given input\ninput_value = 72\noutput_value = calculate_output(input_value)\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code output of 152 suggests that adding 80 to the input value of 72 results in 152. However, this still does not match the pattern observed in the examples. Let's refine our approach further.\n\nUpon reviewing the examples again, it seems that the output is not simply a fixed addition to the input. Instead, the output appears to be a combination of doubling the input and adding a certain value. Let's try a different approach by examining the differences more closely and considering a combination of operations.\n\nLet's calculate the output by doubling the input and then adding a specific value that fits the pattern observed in the examples.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the output based on the input\ndef calculate_output(input_value):\n    # Calculate the output using a pattern observed from the examples\n    # The pattern seems to involve doubling the input and adding a specific value\n    output_value = 2 * input_value + 8\n    return output_value\n\n# Test the function with the given input\ninput_value = 72\noutput_value = calculate_output(input_value)\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code output of 152 indicates that the formula \\(2 \\times \\text{input} + 8\\) does not match the pattern observed in the examples.
