    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input sequence to the output. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. In Example 1, each number in the sequence is doubled to get the next number. The last number is 12416, and doubling it gives 24832, which is the output.\n2. In Example 2, the same pattern is observed: each number is doubled to get the next number. The last number is 5376, and doubling it gives 10752, which is the output.\n3. In Example 3, the sequence is 93, 186, 372. Doubling 372 gives 744, which is the output.\n4. In Example 4, the sequence is 44, 88, 176. Doubling 176 gives 352, which is the output.\n\nThe rule is consistent across all examples: the output is the last number in the sequence doubled.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input [31, 62, 124]:\n\n- The last number in the sequence is 124.\n- Doubling 124 gives 248.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to double the last number in the sequence.\n\n```python\n# Given input sequence\nsequence = [31, 62, 124]\n\n# Double the last number in the sequence\noutput = sequence[-1] * 2\n\n# Print the output\nprint([output])\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the output. Let's proceed with the final answer.\n\n<<<[248]>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches our expected result. Therefore, the final answer for the given input [31, 62, 124] is:\n\n<<<[248]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
