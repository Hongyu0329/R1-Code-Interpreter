    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [13, 22, 9]\n   - Output: [44]\n   - Observation: The sum of the input numbers is 44.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [42, 71, 54, 60, 55, 73, 57, 67]\n   - Output: [479]\n   - Observation: The sum of the input numbers is 479.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [72, 71, 57, 19, 53, 51, 9, 54]\n   - Output: [386]\n   - Observation: The sum of the input numbers is 386.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [19, 26, 19, 40, 28, 89, 85]\n   - Output: [306]\n   - Observation: The sum of the input numbers is 306.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the output is simply the sum of the numbers in the input list. \n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input:** [14, 13, 50, 80, 94, 9]\n\nWe will calculate the sum of these numbers using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of the input list\ninput_list = [14, 13, 50, 80, 94, 9]\noutput = sum(input_list)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will use the result to provide the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the sum of the input list [14, 13, 50, 80, 94, 9] as 260. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, the output for the given input is the sum of the numbers in the list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[260]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
