Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided.

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output based on the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [1895] -> Output: [0]\n2. Input: [50] -> Output: [1]\n3. Input: [1135] -> Output: [0]\n4. Input: [370] -> Output: [1]\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that the output is either 0 or 1. We need to determine what characteristic of the input number leads to these outputs.\n\nOne possible approach is to check if the input number is divisible by a certain number, as this is a common pattern in such problems. Let's test divisibility by 5, as the numbers 50 and 370 (which map to 1) are both divisible by 5, while 1895 and 1135 (which map to 0) are not.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check if the input number is divisible by 5 and use this to determine the output.\n\n```python\ndef determine_output(number):\n    if number % 5 == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ninput_number = 2265\noutput = determine_output(input_number)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to see if it correctly determines the output for the input [2265].",
    "The code executed successfully and returned an output of 1. This suggests that the input number 2265 is divisible by 5, which aligns with the pattern we identified from the examples. Therefore, the output for the input [2265] is 1.\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
