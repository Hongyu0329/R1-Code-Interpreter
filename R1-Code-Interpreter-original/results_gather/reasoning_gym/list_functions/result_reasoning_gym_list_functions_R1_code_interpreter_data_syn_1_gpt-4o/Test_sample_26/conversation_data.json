    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [27, 95, 83, 26, 6, 25] -> Output: [25, 6, 26, 83, 95, 27]\n2. Input: [52, 46, 37, 34, 58, 79, 54, 37, 75, 14] -> Output: [14, 75, 37, 54, 79, 58, 34, 37, 46, 52]\n3. Input: [63, 28, 61] -> Output: [61, 28, 63]\n4. Input: [58, 71, 85, 49] -> Output: [49, 85, 71, 58]\n\nObservations:\n- The output list seems to be a rearrangement of the input list.\n- The first element of the output is the smallest element of the input list.\n- The second element of the output is the largest element of the input list.\n- The third element of the output is the second smallest element of the input list.\n- The fourth element of the output is the second largest element of the input list.\n- This pattern continues, alternating between the next smallest and next largest elements.\n\nLet's apply this pattern to the new input list: [8, 13, 86, 100, 18, 39, 5, 24].\n\nTo implement this, we can sort the list and then alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements.\n\n```python\ndef rearrange_list(input_list):\n    sorted_list = sorted(input_list)\n    result = []\n    while sorted_list:\n        if sorted_list:\n            result.append(sorted_list.pop(0))  # smallest\n        if sorted_list:\n            result.append(sorted_list.pop(-1))  # largest\n    return result\n\ninput_list = [8, 13, 86, 100, 18, 39, 5, 24]\noutput_list = rearrange_list(input_list)\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the output for the given input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output list: [5, 100, 8, 86, 13, 39, 18, 24]. This output follows the pattern we identified: alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements from the input list.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer based on this output.\n\n<<<[5, 100, 8, 86, 13, 39, 18, 24]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
