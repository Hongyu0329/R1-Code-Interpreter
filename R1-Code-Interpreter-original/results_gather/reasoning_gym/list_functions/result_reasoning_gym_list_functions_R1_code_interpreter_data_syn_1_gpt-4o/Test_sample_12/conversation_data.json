    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps each input list to its corresponding output list. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [67, 70, 90, 15, 23, 49, 29, 38, 4]\n   - Output: [67, 71, 92, 18, 27, 54, 35, 45, 12]\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [15, 73, 2, 13, 21, 100]\n   - Output: [15, 74, 4, 16, 25, 105]\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [89, 82, 49, 76, 52, 99, 89]\n   - Output: [89, 83, 51, 79, 56, 104, 95]\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [46, 10, 44, 37, 80, 21, 15, 66]\n   - Output: [46, 11, 46, 40, 84, 26, 21, 73]\n\n**Observations:**\n- The first element in each list remains unchanged.\n- For the second element, it seems to increase by 1.\n- For the third element, it increases by 2.\n- For the fourth element, it increases by 3.\n- For the fifth element, it increases by 4.\n- For the sixth element, it increases by 5.\n- For the seventh element, it increases by 6.\n- For the eighth element, it increases by 7.\n- For the ninth element, it increases by 8.\n\nThe pattern suggests that starting from the second element, each element is increased by an incrementing integer starting from 1.\n\nLet's apply this pattern to the new input list [76, 13, 35, 41]:\n\n```python\n# Define the input list\ninput_list = [76, 13, 35, 41]\n\n# Initialize the output list with the first element unchanged\noutput_list = [input_list[0]]\n\n# Apply the pattern to the rest of the elements\nfor i in range(1, len(input_list)):\n    output_list.append(input_list[i] + i)\n\n# Print the output list\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the transformed list based on the identified pattern.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output `[76, 14, 37, 44]`. This output is consistent with the pattern we identified, where each element from the second position onward is incremented by an increasing integer starting from 1.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer based on this output.\n\n<<<[76, 14, 37, 44]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
