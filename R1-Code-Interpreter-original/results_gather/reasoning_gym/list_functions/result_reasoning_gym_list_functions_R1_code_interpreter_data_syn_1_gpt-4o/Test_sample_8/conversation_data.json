    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output based on the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [3755] -> Output: [0]\n2. Input: [590] -> Output: [1]\n3. Input: [2675] -> Output: [0]\n4. Input: [750] -> Output: [1]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe the following:\n\n- The inputs that result in an output of [1] are 590 and 750.\n- The inputs that result in an output of [0] are 3755 and 2675.\n\nLet's look for a common property or pattern in the numbers that result in the same output.\n\nOne possible approach is to check if the numbers are divisible by a certain number or if they have a specific property related to their digits. Let's explore the divisibility by 5, as all numbers end with either 0 or 5.\n\n- 590 and 750 both end with 0, and they are divisible by 10.\n- 3755 and 2675 both end with 5, and they are not divisible by 10.\n\nThis suggests that the output is [1] if the number is divisible by 10, and [0] otherwise.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the input [295]:\n\n- 295 ends with 5, so it is not divisible by 10.\n\nTherefore, according to the identified pattern, the output for the input [295] should be [0].\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
