    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [9, 31, 60, 40, 86]\n   - Output: [9, 32, 62, 43, 90]\n   - Observations: \n     - 31 -> 32 (+1)\n     - 60 -> 62 (+2)\n     - 40 -> 43 (+3)\n     - 86 -> 90 (+4)\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [22, 66, 24, 21, 1, 34, 82, 22]\n   - Output: [22, 67, 26, 24, 5, 39, 88, 29]\n   - Observations:\n     - 66 -> 67 (+1)\n     - 24 -> 26 (+2)\n     - 21 -> 24 (+3)\n     - 1 -> 5 (+4)\n     - 34 -> 39 (+5)\n     - 82 -> 88 (+6)\n     - 22 -> 29 (+7)\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [4, 61, 61, 67]\n   - Output: [4, 62, 63, 70]\n   - Observations:\n     - 61 -> 62 (+1)\n     - 61 -> 63 (+2)\n     - 67 -> 70 (+3)\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [100, 44, 76]\n   - Output: [100, 45, 78]\n   - Observations:\n     - 44 -> 45 (+1)\n     - 76 -> 78 (+2)\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves adding an incrementing integer to each element starting from the second element. The increment starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each subsequent element.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input [89, 28, 92, 11, 42]:\n\n- The first element remains unchanged: 89\n- The second element: 28 + 1 = 29\n- The third element: 92 + 2 = 94\n- The fourth element: 11 + 3 = 14\n- The fifth element: 42 + 4 = 46\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify:\n\n```python\ndef transform_list(input_list):\n    output_list = [input_list[0]]  # First element remains unchanged\n    for i in range(1, len(input_list)):\n        output_list.append(input_list[i] + i)\n    return output_list\n\ninput_data = [89, 28, 92, 11, 42]\noutput_data = transform_list(input_data)\nprint(output_data)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the transformed list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the transformed list [89, 29, 94, 14, 46]. This matches the expected transformation based on the pattern identified from the examples.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the input [89, 28, 92, 11, 42] is:\n\n<<<[89, 29, 94, 14, 46]>>>"
