    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [57, 45, 77, 21, 31] -> Output: [77]\n2. Input: [93, 89, 64, 20, 9, 45] -> Output: [64]\n3. Input: [26, 15, 93] -> Output: [93]\n4. Input: [92, 40, 23, 53, 62, 89, 48, 80, 12, 49] -> Output: [23]\n\nObservations:\n- In each example, the output is a single number from the input list.\n- The number selected seems to be the one with the highest value in the list.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis by checking if the output is indeed the maximum number in each input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input [34, 100, 63, 6] to find the output.\n\n```python\n# Define the input list\ninput_list = [34, 100, 63, 6]\n\n# Find the maximum value in the list\nmax_value = max(input_list)\n\n# Print the result\nprint([max_value])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output based on the identified rule.",
    "Based on the code execution, the maximum value in the input list [34, 100, 63, 6] is 100. Therefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[100]>>>"
