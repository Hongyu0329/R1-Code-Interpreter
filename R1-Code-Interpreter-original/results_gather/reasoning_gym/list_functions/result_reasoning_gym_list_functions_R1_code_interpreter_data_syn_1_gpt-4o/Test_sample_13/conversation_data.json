    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [54, 63, 33, 11, 39, 44, 3] -> Output: [54, 63, 33, 11, 39, 44, 3]\n2. Input: [62, 2, 15, 37] -> Output: [62, 2, 15, 37]\n3. Input: [40, 96, 84, 5] -> Output: [40, 96, 84, 5]\n4. Input: [18, 35, 95, 20] -> Output: [18, 35, 95, 20]\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the output is identical to the input. There is no transformation or filtering applied to the input list; it is simply returned as is.\n\nGiven this pattern, the rule seems to be that the output is the same as the input. Therefore, for the input [98, 92, 55, 10, 79, 53], the output should be the same list.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<[98, 92, 55, 10, 79, 53]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are an expert at inductive reasoning.
