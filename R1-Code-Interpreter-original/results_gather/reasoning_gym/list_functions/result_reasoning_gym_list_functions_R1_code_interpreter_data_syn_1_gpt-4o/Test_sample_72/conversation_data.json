    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [26, 94, 99] -> Output: [27, 94, 100]\n2. Input: [51, 43, 1, 92, 17, 3] -> Output: [52, 43, 1, 92, 17, 4]\n3. Input: [14, 19, 16, 10, 84] -> Output: [15, 19, 16, 10, 85]\n4. Input: [48, 83, 8, 26, 75, 33, 51, 42] -> Output: [49, 83, 8, 26, 75, 33, 51, 43]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n- The first element of the list is incremented by 1.\n- The last element of the list is also incremented by 1.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to the given input [81, 39, 53, 6, 60].\n\n1. Increment the first element (81) by 1, resulting in 82.\n2. Keep the middle elements (39, 53, 6) unchanged.\n3. Increment the last element (60) by 1, resulting in 61.\n\nThus, the transformed list should be [82, 39, 53, 6, 61].\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to apply the pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform_list(input_list):\n    if len(input_list) > 1:\n        input_list[0] += 1\n        input_list[-1] += 1\n    return input_list\n\ninput_data = [81, 39, 53, 6, 60]\noutput_data = transform_list(input_data)\nprint(output_data)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the expected output. Based on the pattern identified and the code execution, the final transformed list for the input [81, 39, 53, 6, 60] is:\n\n<<<[82, 39, 53, 6, 61]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
