    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. Input: 25 -> Output: 46\n2. Input: 29 -> Output: 54\n3. Input: 17 -> Output: 30\n4. Input: 58 -> Output: 112\n\nLet's try to find a mathematical relationship between the input and output values. \n\n- For Input 1: 25 to Output 1: 46, the difference is 46 - 25 = 21.\n- For Input 2: 29 to Output 2: 54, the difference is 54 - 29 = 25.\n- For Input 3: 17 to Output 3: 30, the difference is 30 - 17 = 13.\n- For Input 4: 58 to Output 4: 112, the difference is 112 - 58 = 54.\n\nThe differences are 21, 25, 13, and 54. These differences do not immediately suggest a simple arithmetic pattern. Let's consider if there might be a multiplicative or other operation involved.\n\nLet's try to find a consistent pattern by examining the ratio of output to input:\n\n- For Input 1: 46 / 25 = 1.84\n- For Input 2: 54 / 29 = 1.862\n- For Input 3: 30 / 17 = 1.7647\n- For Input 4: 112 / 58 = 1.931\n\nThe ratios are not consistent, suggesting a more complex relationship. Let's try to find a pattern using a different approach, such as a combination of multiplication and addition.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern using a linear transformation of the form: Output = a * Input + b\n\nWe can use the first two examples to set up equations and solve for a and b:\n\n1. 46 = a * 25 + b\n2. 54 = a * 29 + b\n\nSolving these equations will help us find the values of a and b. Let's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\na, b = symbols('a b')\n\n# Define the equations based on the examples\neq1 = Eq(a * 25 + b, 46)\neq2 = Eq(a * 29 + b, 54)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, b))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nOnce we have the values of a and b, we can apply the same transformation to the input [1] to find the output.",
    "The solution to the equations gives us \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = -4 \\). This means the transformation rule that maps the input to the output is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times \\text{Input} - 4 \\]\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the input [1]:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times 1 - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [1] is -2.\n\n<<<[-2]>>>"
