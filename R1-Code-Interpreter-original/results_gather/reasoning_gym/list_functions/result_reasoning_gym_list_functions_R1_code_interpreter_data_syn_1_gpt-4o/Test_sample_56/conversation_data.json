    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [25, 43, 24, 81, 2, 68, 99, 90, 2]\n   - Output: [43, 81, 2, 99, 90]\n   - Observation: The output includes numbers that are either greater than their preceding number or are the first occurrence of a number.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [88, 60, 18, 29, 16, 89, 18, 78]\n   - Output: [88, 60, 29, 89, 18]\n   - Observation: Similar pattern, where each number in the output is greater than the number before it in the input or is the first number.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [57, 53, 42, 86, 56]\n   - Output: [53, 42, 86]\n   - Observation: The first number is not included, and each subsequent number is greater than the previous number in the output.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [40, 21, 16, 60, 44]\n   - Output: [21, 16, 60]\n   - Observation: The first number is not included, and each subsequent number is greater than the previous number in the output.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems the rule is:\n- Start from the second element of the list.\n- Include a number in the output if it is greater than the last number included in the output.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input [20, 32, 57]:\n\n```python\ndef generate_output(input_list):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(1, len(input_list)):\n        if not output or input_list[i] > output[-1]:\n            output.append(input_list[i])\n    return output\n\ninput_list = [20, 32, 57]\noutput = generate_output(input_list)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `[32, 57]`. This matches the pattern we identified from the examples, where each number in the output is greater than the last number included in the output, starting from the second element of the input list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the input `[20, 32, 57]` is:\n\n<<<[32, 57]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
