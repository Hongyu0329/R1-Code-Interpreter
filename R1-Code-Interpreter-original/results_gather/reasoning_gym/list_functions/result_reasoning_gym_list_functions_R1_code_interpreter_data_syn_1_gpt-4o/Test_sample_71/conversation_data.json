    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps each input list to its corresponding output list. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [93, 90, 95, 28, 89, 10, 78, 95, 16, 84]\n   - Output: [93, 91, 97, 31, 93, 15, 84, 102, 24, 93]\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [60, 44, 87, 16, 63, 11, 17, 29, 75]\n   - Output: [60, 45, 89, 19, 67, 16, 23, 36, 83]\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [6, 29, 14]\n   - Output: [6, 30, 16]\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [78, 67, 38, 24, 96]\n   - Output: [78, 68, 40, 27, 100]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n- Each element in the output list is derived from the corresponding element in the input list by adding a certain value.\n- The value added seems to be increasing as we move through the list.\n\nLet's try to deduce the rule:\n- For the first element, the output is the same as the input.\n- For the second element, the output is the input plus 1.\n- For the third element, the output is the input plus 2.\n- For the fourth element, the output is the input plus 3.\n- This pattern continues, with the increment increasing by 1 for each subsequent element.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input list: [94, 75, 93, 87, 54, 30, 85, 74, 99].\n\nWe will write a Python script to apply this rule to the input list and generate the output list.\n\n```python\ninput_list = [94, 75, 93, 87, 54, 30, 85, 74, 99]\noutput_list = [input_list[i] + i for i in range(len(input_list))]\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output list by applying the identified pattern. Each element in the output list is derived by adding its index to the corresponding element in the input list.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer based on the code execution:\n\n<<<[94, 76, 95, 90, 58, 35, 91, 81, 107]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
