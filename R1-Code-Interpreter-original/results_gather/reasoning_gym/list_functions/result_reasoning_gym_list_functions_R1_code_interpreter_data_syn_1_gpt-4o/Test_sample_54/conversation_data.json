  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [72, 41, 96]\nOutput 1: [96, 72, 41]\nInput 2: [99, 9, 91]\nOutput 2: [99, 91, 9]\nInput 3: [93, 49, 14, 65, 13, 53, 59]\nOutput 3: [93, 65, 59, 53, 49, 14, 13]\nInput 4: [75, 99, 98]\nOutput 4: [99, 98, 75]\n\n\nInput: [27, 47, 8, 23, 51, 37]\nOutput:\n",

    "The task is to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [72, 41, 96] -> Output: [96, 72, 41]\n2. Input: [99, 9, 91] -> Output: [99, 91, 9]\n3. Input: [93, 49, 14, 65, 13, 53, 59] -> Output: [93, 65, 59, 53, 49, 14, 13]\n4. Input: [75, 99, 98] -> Output: [99, 98, 75]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the output list is the input list sorted in descending order. \n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input list [27, 47, 8, 23, 51, 37].\n\nTo confirm this, I will write a Python script to sort the list in descending order.\n\n```python\n# Input list\ninput_list = [27, 47, 8, 23, 51, 37]\n\n# Sort the list in descending order\noutput_list = sorted(input_list, reverse=True)\n\n# Print the output list\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and sorted the input list in descending order. The output list is [51, 47, 37, 27, 23, 8]. This matches the pattern observed in the examples provided.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the input [27, 47, 8, 23, 51, 37] is:\n\n<<<[51, 47, 37, 27, 23, 8]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
