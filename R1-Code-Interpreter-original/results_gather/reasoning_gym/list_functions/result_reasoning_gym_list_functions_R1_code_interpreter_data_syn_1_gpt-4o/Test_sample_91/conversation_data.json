    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [35, 12, 99] -> Output: [99]\n2. Input: [35, 14, 5, 49, 69, 72, 43, 44, 7] -> Output: [5]\n3. Input: [18, 44, 72, 43, 90] -> Output: [72]\n4. Input: [21, 1, 56, 100, 12, 77] -> Output: [56]\n\nObservations:\n- In the first example, the largest number is selected.\n- In the second example, the smallest number is selected.\n- In the third example, the largest number is selected.\n- In the fourth example, the largest number is selected.\n\nIt seems that the rule is to select the largest number from the list, except in the second example where the smallest number is selected. This suggests that there might be a pattern or condition that determines whether to select the largest or smallest number.\n\nLet's try to identify a consistent rule by examining the input list and the output:\n\n- For the first example, the largest number is selected.\n- For the second example, the smallest number is selected.\n- For the third example, the largest number is selected.\n- For the fourth example, the largest number is selected.\n\nThe rule seems to be to select the largest number unless there is a specific condition that requires selecting the smallest number. However, without additional context or a clear pattern, it is challenging to determine the exact condition for selecting the smallest number.\n\nGiven the input [9, 1, 41, 94, 58, 14, 6, 12, 86], let's assume the rule is to select the largest number, as this is the most common pattern in the examples.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the largest number in the list:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [9, 1, 41, 94, 58, 14, 6, 12, 86]\nlargest_number = max(numbers)\nprint(largest_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the largest number.",
    "Based on the code execution, the largest number in the input list [9, 1, 41, 94, 58, 14, 6, 12, 86] is 94. This aligns with the pattern observed in most of the examples, where the largest number is selected.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[94]>>>"
