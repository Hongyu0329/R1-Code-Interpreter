    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [24, 95, 69, 86, 97, 71, 97]\n   - Output: [69]\n   - Observation: The number 69 is the only number in the input that is a multiple of 3.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [14, 11, 55, 81, 32, 23, 33, 36, 27]\n   - Output: [81, 33]\n   - Observation: The numbers 81 and 33 are multiples of 3.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [75, 3, 52, 91, 33, 56, 96, 94, 8, 87]\n   - Output: [3, 33, 56, 96, 94]\n   - Observation: The numbers 3, 33, 56, 96, and 94 are multiples of 3.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [27, 17, 60, 2, 67, 67, 93, 64]\n   - Output: [17, 60, 93]\n   - Observation: The numbers 17, 60, and 93 are multiples of 3.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule is to select numbers from the input list that are multiples of 3. Let's apply this rule to the new input list [14, 6, 31, 28, 62, 49, 61, 69, 78].\n\nWe will write a Python script to filter out the numbers that are multiples of 3 from the input list.\n\n```python\ninput_list = [14, 6, 31, 28, 62, 49, 61, 69, 78]\noutput_list = [x for x in input_list if x % 3 == 0]\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the numbers from the input list that are multiples of 3. Based on the pattern identified, these numbers are the correct output for the given input.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 69, 78]>>>"
