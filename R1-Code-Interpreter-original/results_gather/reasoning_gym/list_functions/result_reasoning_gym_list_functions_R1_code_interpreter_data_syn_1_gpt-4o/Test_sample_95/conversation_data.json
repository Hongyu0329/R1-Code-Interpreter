    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: \n   - Input: [80, 75, 73]\n   - Output: [73]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2**: \n   - Input: [4, 4, 35, 26]\n   - Output: [35]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3**: \n   - Input: [30, 39, 87, 86, 40, 49, 8, 41, 38]\n   - Output: [87]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4**: \n   - Input: [49, 14, 12, 95]\n   - Output: [12]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule alternates between selecting the smallest and the largest number from the list. \n\n- For odd-numbered examples (1 and 3), the output is the smallest number.\n- For even-numbered examples (2 and 4), the output is the largest number.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- Input: [45, 3, 61, 23, 94, 78, 92, 48]\n\nSince this is the 5th example (odd-numbered), we should select the smallest number from the list.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the smallest number in the list:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [45, 3, 61, 23, 94, 78, 92, 48]\nsmallest_number = min(numbers)\nprint(smallest_number)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the smallest number in the list.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the smallest number from the list, which is 3. Based on the pattern we identified, for the 5th example (an odd-numbered example), we select the smallest number from the list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3]>>>"
