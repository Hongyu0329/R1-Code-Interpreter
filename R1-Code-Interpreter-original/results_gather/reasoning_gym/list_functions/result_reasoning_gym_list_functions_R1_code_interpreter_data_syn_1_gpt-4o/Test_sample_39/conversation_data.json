    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output list. Let's analyze the provided examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Input: [2, 20, 26, 34, 34, 66, 80, 97] -> Output: [1]\n2. **Example 2**: Input: [77, 66, 26, 8] -> Output: [0]\n3. **Example 3**: Input: [4, 47, 59, 65, 68, 89] -> Output: [1]\n4. **Example 4**: Input: [83, 45, 45, 22, 5] -> Output: [0]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe the following:\n\n- The output is either [0] or [1].\n- The output seems to depend on some property of the input list.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the output is determined by whether the list is sorted in ascending order or not:\n\n- In Example 1, the list is sorted in ascending order, and the output is [1].\n- In Example 2, the list is not sorted in ascending order, and the output is [0].\n- In Example 3, the list is sorted in ascending order, and the output is [1].\n- In Example 4, the list is not sorted in ascending order, and the output is [0].\n\nThis hypothesis seems consistent with the examples. Let's apply this rule to the new input [50, 75, 83]:\n\n- Check if the list [50, 75, 83] is sorted in ascending order.\n\nWe can use Python code to verify this:\n\n```python\ndef is_sorted_ascending(lst):\n    return lst == sorted(lst)\n\ninput_list = [50, 75, 83]\noutput = [1] if is_sorted_ascending(input_list) else [0]\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the output.",
    "The code output indicates that the list [50, 75, 83] is sorted in ascending order, which matches our hypothesis. Therefore, the output for the given input should be [1].\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
