  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [2, 97, 83, 16, 95, 17, 62]\nOutput 1: [2, 16, 17, 62, 83, 95, 97]\nInput 2: [32, 36, 53, 75, 55, 74, 10, 58, 9, 41]\nOutput 2: [9, 10, 32, 36, 41, 53, 55, 58, 74, 75]\nInput 3: [64, 8, 72, 67, 14, 52, 57, 22]\nOutput 3: [8, 14, 22, 52, 57, 64, 67, 72]\nInput 4: [19, 63, 72, 11, 66, 60, 80, 27]\nOutput 4: [11, 19, 27, 60, 63, 66, 72, 80]\n\n\nInput: [70, 34, 91, 48, 52, 6, 55, 81, 1]\nOutput:\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. By examining the examples, we can see that the output is simply the input list sorted in ascending order. \n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input list: [70, 34, 91, 48, 52, 6, 55, 81, 1]. We will sort this list in ascending order using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the input list\ninput_list = [70, 34, 91, 48, 52, 6, 55, 81, 1]\n\n# Sort the list in ascending order\nsorted_list = sorted(input_list)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list. Based on the pattern identified from the examples, the input list is sorted in ascending order to produce the output.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the given input [70, 34, 91, 48, 52, 6, 55, 81, 1] is:\n\n<<<[1, 6, 34, 48, 52, 55, 70, 81, 91]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
