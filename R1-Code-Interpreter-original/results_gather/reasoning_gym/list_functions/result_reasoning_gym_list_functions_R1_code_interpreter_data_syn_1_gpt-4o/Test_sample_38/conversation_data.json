    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [38, 90, 59, 58]\n   - Output: [245]\n   - Observation: The output is the sum of the input numbers: 38 + 90 + 59 + 58 = 245.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [42, 14, 20, 87, 87]\n   - Output: [250]\n   - Observation: The output is the sum of the input numbers: 42 + 14 + 20 + 87 + 87 = 250.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [92, 86, 53, 49, 31, 52]\n   - Output: [363]\n   - Observation: The output is the sum of the input numbers: 92 + 86 + 53 + 49 + 31 + 52 = 363.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [65, 41, 99, 36]\n   - Output: [241]\n   - Observation: The output is the sum of the input numbers: 65 + 41 + 99 + 36 = 241.\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that the rule is to sum all the elements of the input list to get the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input [100, 58, 13, 12, 5, 63, 45, 37, 18]:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of the input list\ninput_list = [100, 58, 13, 12, 5, 63, 45, 37, 18]\noutput = sum(input_list)\nprint([output])\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the sum of the input list and print it as a list. Let's execute the code to find the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sum of the input list as [351]. This matches the pattern observed in the examples, where the output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the given input [100, 58, 13, 12, 5, 63, 45, 37, 18] is:\n\n<<<[351]>>>"
