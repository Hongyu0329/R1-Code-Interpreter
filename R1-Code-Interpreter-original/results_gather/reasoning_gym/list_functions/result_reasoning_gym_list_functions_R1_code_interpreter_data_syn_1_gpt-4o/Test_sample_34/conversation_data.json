    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [40, 56, 32, 58] -> Output: [58, 32, 56, 40]\n2. Input: [33, 72, 13, 96, 64, 24, 60] -> Output: [60, 24, 64, 96, 13, 72, 33]\n3. Input: [92, 9, 92, 47, 94] -> Output: [94, 47, 92, 9, 92]\n4. Input: [53, 94, 91, 59, 82] -> Output: [82, 59, 91, 94, 53]\n\nObservations:\n- The output list seems to be a rearrangement of the input list.\n- The rearrangement does not appear to be a simple reverse or sort.\n- The pattern might involve a specific reordering based on some criteria.\n\nLet's try to deduce the pattern:\n- In each example, the output list seems to start with the largest number from the input list.\n- The second number in the output list is the smallest number from the input list.\n- The third number in the output list is the second largest number from the input list.\n- This pattern continues, alternating between the largest remaining and smallest remaining numbers.\n\nLet's apply this pattern to the new input [68, 15, 50]:\n\n1. Start with the largest number: 68\n2. Next, the smallest number: 15\n3. Then, the second largest number: 50\n\nThus, the output list should be [68, 15, 50].\n\nNow, let's confirm this pattern by implementing a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef rearrange_list(input_list):\n    sorted_list = sorted(input_list)\n    output_list = []\n    while sorted_list:\n        if sorted_list:\n            output_list.append(sorted_list.pop())  # largest\n        if sorted_list:\n            output_list.append(sorted_list.pop(0))  # smallest\n    return output_list\n\ninput_data = [68, 15, 50]\noutput_data = rearrange_list(input_data)\nprint(output_data)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output [68, 15, 50], which matches our expected result based on the identified pattern. Therefore, the final answer for the given input is:\n\n<<<[68, 15, 50]>>>"
