Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [67, 73, 71, 72, 76, 35, 87, 98, 13]\nOutput 1: [67, 73, 71, 72, 76, 35, 87, 98, 13]\nInput 2: [21, 10, 74, 86, 81, 44, 8, 6, 4, 83]\nOutput 2: [21, 10, 74, 86, 81, 44, 8, 6, 4, 83]\nInput 3: [75, 21, 78, 79, 21]\nOutput 3: [75, 21, 78, 79, 21]\nInput 4: [62, 96, 87, 100, 22, 92, 16, 87, 20]\nOutput 4: [62, 96, 87, 100, 22, 92, 16, 87, 20]\n\n\nInput: [9, 56, 47, 53, 5, 35, 22, 89, 23, 29]\nOutput:\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. In each example, the output is identical to the input. This suggests that the rule is simply to return the input list as the output list without any modifications.\n\nGiven this understanding, the output for the provided input should be the same as the input list.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input `[9, 56, 47, 53, 5, 35, 22, 89, 23, 29]` is:\n\n<<<[9, 56, 47, 53, 5, 35, 22, 89, 23, 29]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are an expert at inductive reasoning.
