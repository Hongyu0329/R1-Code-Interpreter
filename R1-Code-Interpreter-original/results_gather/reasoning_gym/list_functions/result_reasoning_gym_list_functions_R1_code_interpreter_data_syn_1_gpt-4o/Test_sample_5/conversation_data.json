    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. In Example 1, the first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1.\n2. In Example 2, the first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1.\n3. In Example 3, the first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1.\n4. In Example 4, the first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule is to increment the first and last elements of the list by 1, while keeping the other elements unchanged.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given input list [47, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 47]:\n\n- Increment the first element (47) by 1 to get 48.\n- Increment the last element (47) by 1 to get 48.\n- Keep the other elements unchanged.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to apply this rule to the input list.\n\n```python\ndef transform_list(input_list):\n    if len(input_list) > 0:\n        input_list[0] += 1\n        input_list[-1] += 1\n    return input_list\n\ninput_data = [47, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 47]\noutput_data = transform_list(input_data)\nprint(output_data)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the transformed list according to the identified rule.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output list [48, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 48]. This matches the expected transformation based on the rule we identified: incrementing the first and last elements of the list by 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the given input is:\n\n<<<[48, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 48]>>>"
