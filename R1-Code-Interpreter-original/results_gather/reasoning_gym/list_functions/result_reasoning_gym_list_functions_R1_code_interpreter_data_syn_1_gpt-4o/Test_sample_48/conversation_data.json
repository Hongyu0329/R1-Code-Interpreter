    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [51, 70, 91, 54, 48, 47, 69]\n   - Output: [7]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [48, 4, 71, 98, 50, 29, 80, 7, 50]\n   - Output: [9]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [22, 68, 73, 2, 19, 58]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [21, 30, 48, 46, 76]\n   - Output: [5]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the output is simply the count of elements in the input list. Let's apply this rule to the new input.\n\nGiven Input: [81, 27, 35, 34, 11]\n\nLet's calculate the number of elements in this list using Python code.\n\n```python\ninput_list = [81, 27, 35, 34, 11]\noutput = len(input_list)\nprint([output])\n```\n\nThe code will count the number of elements in the input list and print the result. Let's execute this code to find the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `[5]`. This matches our expectation based on the pattern observed in the examples, where the output is the count of elements in the input list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the given input `[81, 27, 35, 34, 11]` is:\n\n<<<[5]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are an expert at inductive reasoning.
