    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Input: [80, 75, 99, 94, 85, 55] -> Output: [6]\n2. **Example 2**: Input: [98, 40, 18, 55, 70, 97, 16, 33, 38, 77] -> Output: [10]\n3. **Example 3**: Input: [91, 85, 36] -> Output: [3]\n4. **Example 4**: Input: [25, 24, 76, 25, 20, 95, 69, 18] -> Output: [8]\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the output is simply the count of elements in the input list. Let's verify this hypothesis:\n\n- In Example 1, the input list has 6 elements, and the output is [6].\n- In Example 2, the input list has 10 elements, and the output is [10].\n- In Example 3, the input list has 3 elements, and the output is [3].\n- In Example 4, the input list has 8 elements, and the output is [8].\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the output is a list containing a single element, which is the count of elements in the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input: [48, 15, 10, 21, 9, 64].\n\nThe input list has 6 elements. Therefore, the output should be a list containing the number 6.\n\n<<<[6]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are an expert at inductive reasoning.
