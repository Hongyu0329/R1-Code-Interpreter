    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [57, 38, 33, 62, 85, 12, 50, 96, 11, 10]\n   Output: [10, 11, 96, 50, 12, 85, 62, 33, 38, 57]\n\n2. Input: [38, 10, 81, 40, 96, 79]\n   Output: [79, 96, 40, 81, 10, 38]\n\n3. Input: [29, 85, 17]\n   Output: [17, 85, 29]\n\n4. Input: [31, 36, 77, 87, 4, 5, 77, 92]\n   Output: [92, 77, 5, 4, 87, 77, 36, 31]\n\nObservations:\n- The output list seems to be a rearrangement of the input list.\n- The output list is not sorted in ascending or descending order.\n- The output list appears to be a combination of reversing the input list and possibly some other transformation.\n\nLet's try to reverse the input list and see if it matches the pattern:\n\n```python\ninput_list = [30, 98, 79, 72, 55]\noutput_list = input_list[::-1]\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The reversed list [55, 72, 79, 98, 30] does not match the pattern observed in the examples. It seems that simply reversing the list is not sufficient to generate the correct output. Let's analyze the examples further to identify the correct transformation.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the output list is generated by reversing the input list and then performing a specific transformation. The transformation involves reversing the order of the elements in the input list and then rearranging them in a specific pattern.\n\nLet's try a different approach by analyzing the pattern more closely. It seems that the output list is generated by reversing the input list and then rearranging the elements in a specific order. Let's try to identify this order by analyzing the examples again.\n\n1.
