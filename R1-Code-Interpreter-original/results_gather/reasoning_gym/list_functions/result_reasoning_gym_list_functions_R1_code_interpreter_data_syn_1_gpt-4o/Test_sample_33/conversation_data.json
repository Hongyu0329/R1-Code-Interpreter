    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input sequence to the output. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. In Example 1, the sequence is [59, 118, 236, 472, 944, 1888, 3776, 7552, 15104]. The output is [30208]. \n   - Observing the sequence, each number is double the previous one. The output is the next number in the sequence, which is also double the last number in the input sequence.\n\n2. In Example 2, the sequence is [29, 58, 116, 232, 464, 928, 1856, 3712, 7424]. The output is [14848].\n   - Similarly, each number is double the previous one, and the output is the next number in the sequence, which is double the last number in the input sequence.\n\n3. In Example 3, the sequence is [21, 42, 84, 168, 336, 672, 1344]. The output is [2688].\n   - Again, each number is double the previous one, and the output is the next number in the sequence, which is double the last number in the input sequence.\n\n4. In Example 4, the sequence is [82, 164, 328, 656, 1312, 2624, 5248, 10496]. The output is [20992].\n   - Each number is double the previous one, and the output is the next number in the sequence, which is double the last number in the input sequence.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule is to double the last number in the input sequence to get the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input sequence [98, 196, 392, 784, 1568, 3136, 6272, 12544, 25088, 50176]:\n\n- The last number in the sequence is 50176.\n- The next number, which is the output, should be double this last number.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = [98, 196, 392, 784, 1568, 3136, 6272, 12544, 25088, 50176]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = input_sequence[-1] * 2\n\n# Print the result\nprint([next_number])\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the output, which is the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is [100352]. This confirms that the next number in the sequence, which is double the last number in the input sequence, is 100352.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[100352]>>>"
