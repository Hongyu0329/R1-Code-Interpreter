    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [9, 56, 71, 59, 74, 44, 33, 66]\n   - Output: [66, 33, 44, 74, 59, 71, 56, 9]\n   - Observation: The output seems to be a reversed version of the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [51, 79, 6, 54, 85, 4, 14, 1, 34]\n   - Output: [34, 1, 14, 4, 85, 54, 6, 79, 51]\n   - Observation: The output is a reversed version of the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [93, 70, 2, 41, 73, 55, 30, 31, 67, 66]\n   - Output: [66, 67, 31, 30, 55, 73, 41, 2, 70, 93]\n   - Observation: The output is a reversed version of the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [57, 31, 5, 72, 48, 92, 89, 46]\n   - Output: [46, 89, 92, 48, 72, 5, 31, 57]\n   - Observation: The output is a reversed version of the input list.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the rule is to reverse the input list to get the output list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input list [72, 74, 98, 26, 31, 94, 5, 17] by reversing it.\n\n```python\n# Reversing the input list\ninput_list = [72, 74, 98, 26, 31, 94, 5, 17]\noutput_list = input_list[::-1]\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the reversed list, which should be the output according to the identified pattern.",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the reversed list of the input. Based on the pattern identified from the examples, the output for the input list [72, 74, 98, 26, 31, 94, 5, 17] is the reversed list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[17, 5, 94, 31, 26, 98, 74, 72]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
