    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: 52, Output: 100\n2. Input: 73, Output: 142\n3. Input: 21, Output: 38\n4. Input: 91, Output: 178\n\nLet's try to find a relationship between each input and its corresponding output. \n\n- For Input 1: 52 to Output 1: 100\n  - The difference is 100 - 52 = 48\n\n- For Input 2: 73 to Output 2: 142\n  - The difference is 142 - 73 = 69\n\n- For Input 3: 21 to Output 3: 38\n  - The difference is 38 - 21 = 17\n\n- For Input 4: 91 to Output 4: 178\n  - The difference is 178 - 91 = 87\n\nThe differences are 48, 69, 17, and 87. These differences do not form a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence, so let's try another approach.\n\nLet's check if there is a multiplicative factor:\n\n- For Input 1: 52 * 2 = 104, which is close to 100\n- For Input 2: 73 * 2 = 146, which is close to 142\n- For Input 3: 21 * 2 = 42, which is close to 38\n- For Input 4: 91 * 2 = 182, which is close to 178\n\nIt seems that the output is approximately twice the input, but slightly less. Let's calculate the exact factor for each:\n\n- For Input 1: 100 / 52 ≈ 1.923\n- For Input 2: 142 / 73 ≈ 1.945\n- For Input 3: 38 / 21 ≈ 1.810\n- For Input 4: 178 / 91 ≈ 1.956\n\nThe factor is not constant, but it is close to 2. Let's assume the rule is to multiply the input by a factor slightly less than 2. \n\nTo find the exact rule, let's calculate the average factor:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the average factor\ninputs = [52, 73, 21, 91]\noutputs = [100, 142, 38, 178]\n\nfactors = [outputs[i] / inputs[i] for i in range(len(inputs))]\naverage_factor = sum(factors) / len(factors)\nprint(average_factor)\n```\n\nOnce we have the average factor, we can apply it to the new input to find the output.\n\nLet's execute the code to find the average factor.",
    "The average factor calculated from the given examples is approximately 1.908. This suggests that the output is obtained by multiplying the input by this factor.\n\nNow, let's apply this factor to the new input, which is 11, to find the corresponding output.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the output for the new input using the average factor\nnew_input = 11\naverage_factor = 1.9084625420241859\noutput = new_input * average_factor\nprint(round(output))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output for the input 11.",
    "The output for the input 11, using the average factor of approximately 1.908, is 21 when rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
