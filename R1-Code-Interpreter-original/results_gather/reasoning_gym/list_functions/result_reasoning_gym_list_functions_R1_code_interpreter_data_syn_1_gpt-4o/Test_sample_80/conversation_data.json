    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: \n   - Input: [90, 21, 75, 80, 5, 5, 60, 5, 54, 86, 97, 85, 39]\n   - Output: [3]\n   - Observation: The number 5 appears multiple times, and the output is 3.\n\n2. **Example 2**: \n   - Input: [94, 96, 78, 87, 22, 89]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 5 does not appear, and the output is 0.\n\n3. **Example 3**: \n   - Input: [51, 5, 5, 5, 29, 40, 9, 87, 5, 3, 5, 9, 5]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - Observation: The number 5 appears 6 times, and the output is 6.\n\n4. **Example 4**: \n   - Input: [67, 19, 85, 68, 80, 38, 56, 71, 22]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 5 does not appear, and the output is 0.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the output is the count of the number 5 in the input list. If 5 does not appear, the output is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- Input: [5, 9, 22, 5, 5, 96, 78, 41, 5, 90, 5, 5]\n\nWe will count the occurrences of the number 5 in this list.\n\n```python\n# Count the occurrences of the number 5 in the input list\ninput_list = [5, 9, 22, 5, 5, 96, 78, 41, 5, 90, 5, 5]\ncount_of_five = input_list.count(5)\nprint([count_of_five])\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the count of the number 5 in the input list. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the count of the number 5 in the input list as 6. Therefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[6]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
