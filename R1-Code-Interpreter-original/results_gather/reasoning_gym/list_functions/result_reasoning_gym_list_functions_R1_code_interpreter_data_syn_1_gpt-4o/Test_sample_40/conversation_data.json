    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output list in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [77, 95, 24, 45]\n   - Output: [241]\n   - Observation: The output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [40, 95, 92, 88, 77, 17, 90, 89]\n   - Output: [588]\n   - Observation: The output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [30, 49, 19, 82, 4, 89, 29, 59]\n   - Output: [361]\n   - Observation: The output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [58, 9, 99]\n   - Output: [166]\n   - Observation: The output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule is to sum all the numbers in the input list to produce the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input:** [12, 65, 41, 93, 3, 54, 33]\n\nWe will calculate the sum of these numbers using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of the input list\ninput_list = [12, 65, 41, 93, 3, 54, 33]\noutput = sum(input_list)\nprint([output])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",
    "Based on the code execution, the sum of the input list [12, 65, 41, 93, 3, 54, 33] is 301. Therefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[301]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are an expert at inductive reasoning.
