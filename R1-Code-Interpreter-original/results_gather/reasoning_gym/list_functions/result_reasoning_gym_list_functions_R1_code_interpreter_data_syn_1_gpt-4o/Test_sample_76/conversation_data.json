  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [92, 11, 85, 50, 94]\nOutput 1: [11, 50, 85, 92, 94]\nInput 2: [49, 26, 11, 39, 28, 24, 26]\nOutput 2: [11, 24, 26, 26, 28, 39, 49]\nInput 3: [25, 15, 25, 11, 72, 55, 14, 69]\nOutput 3: [11, 14, 15, 25, 25, 55, 69, 72]\nInput 4: [85, 50, 28, 81, 89, 79, 83, 8]\nOutput 4: [8, 28, 50, 79, 81, 83, 85, 89]\n\n\nInput: [5, 45, 93, 43, 84, 31, 26, 66, 98, 63]\nOutput:\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. \n\nUpon examining the examples, it is clear that the rule involves sorting the input list in ascending order. Each output list is simply the sorted version of the corresponding input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input list: [5, 45, 93, 43, 84, 31, 26, 66, 98, 63].\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I will write a Python script to sort the list and verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the input list\ninput_list = [5, 45, 93, 43, 84, 31, 26, 66, 98, 63]\n\n# Sort the list in ascending order\nsorted_list = sorted(input_list)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sorted list, which is the expected output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list. Based on the pattern identified from the examples, the sorted list is the correct output for the given input.\n\n<<<[5, 26, 31, 43, 45, 63, 66, 84, 93, 98]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
