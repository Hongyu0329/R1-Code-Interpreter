Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [46]\nOutput 1: [88]\nInput 2: [16]\nOutput 2: [28]\nInput 3: [10]\nOutput 3: [16]\nInput 4: [76]\nOutput 4: [148]\n\n\nInput: [22]\nOutput:\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: 46, Output: 88\n2. Input: 16, Output: 28\n3. Input: 10, Output: 16\n4. Input: 76, Output: 148\n\nWe can observe the following:\n\n- For Input 46, Output 88: The output is 46 * 2 - 4.\n- For Input 16, Output 28: The output is 16 * 2 - 4.\n- For Input 10, Output 16: The output is 10 * 2 - 4.\n- For Input 76, Output 148: The output is 76 * 2 - 4.\n\nThe pattern seems to be: Output = Input * 2 - 4.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input, 22.\n\n```python\n# Applying the identified pattern to the input\ninput_value = 22\noutput_value = input_value * 2 - 4\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the output for the input 22.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output for the input 22 is 40. Based on the identified pattern, the output is calculated as \\(22 \\times 2 - 4 = 40\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<40>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
