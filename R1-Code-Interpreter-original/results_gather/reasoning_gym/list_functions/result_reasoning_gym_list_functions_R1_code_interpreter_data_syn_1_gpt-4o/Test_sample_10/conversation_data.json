    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [95] -> Output 1: [186]\n2. Input 2: [28] -> Output 2: [52]\n3. Input 3: [98] -> Output 3: [192]\n\nLet's try to identify the relationship between the input and output:\n\n- For Input 1: 95 to Output 1: 186\n  - The difference is 186 - 95 = 91\n\n- For Input 2: 28 to Output 2: 52\n  - The difference is 52 - 28 = 24\n\n- For Input 3: 98 to Output 3: 192\n  - The difference is 192 - 98 = 94\n\nThe differences are 91, 24, and 94 respectively. Let's see if there's a consistent pattern or rule that can be applied to these differences.\n\nOne possible approach is to check if the output is approximately double the input, as the differences are close to the input values themselves. Let's verify this hypothesis:\n\n- For Input 1: 95, double is 190, and the output is 186, which is close.\n- For Input 2: 28, double is 56, and the output is 52, which is close.\n- For Input 3: 98, double is 196, and the output is 192, which is close.\n\nIt seems the output is approximately double the input, minus a small adjustment. Let's calculate the exact rule by checking the differences from the doubled values:\n\n- For Input 1: 95, double is 190, difference is 190 - 186 = 4\n- For Input 2: 28, double is 56, difference is 56 - 52 = 4\n- For Input 3: 98, double is 196, difference is 196 - 192 = 4\n\nThe pattern seems to be: Output = 2 * Input - 4\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input [20]:\n\n```python\ninput_value = 20\noutput_value = 2 * input_value - 4\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the output for the input [20].",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output for the input [20] is 36. Based on the pattern identified, the output is calculated as \\(2 \\times \\text{Input} - 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the input [20] is:\n\n<<<36>>>"
