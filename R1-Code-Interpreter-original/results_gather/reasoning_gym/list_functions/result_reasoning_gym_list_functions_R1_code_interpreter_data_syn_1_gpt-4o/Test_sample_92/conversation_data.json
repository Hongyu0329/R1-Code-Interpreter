    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Input: [71, 1, 23, 8, 54, 36, 47] -> Output: [23, 8, 54]\n2. **Example 2**: Input: [41, 22, 51] -> Output: [41]\n3. **Example 3**: Input: [54, 3, 70, 61, 79, 55, 3] -> Output: [3]\n4. **Example 4**: Input: [28, 13, 52, 41, 27, 19] -> Output: [13]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to be a subset of the input.\n- The numbers in the output are not necessarily the smallest or largest.\n- The numbers in the output are not necessarily in any specific order.\n- The numbers in the output might have a specific property or condition.\n\nLet's try to identify a common property among the numbers in the output:\n- In Example 1, the numbers 23, 8, and 54 are all even numbers.\n- In Example 2, the number 41 is odd.\n- In Example 3, the number 3 is odd.\n- In Example 4, the number 13 is odd.\n\nIt seems that the rule might involve selecting numbers based on their parity (odd or even). However, the rule is not consistent across examples, as Example 1 selects even numbers, while the others select odd numbers.\n\nLet's consider another possibility: the numbers in the output might be the smallest or largest based on some condition. Let's check if the numbers in the output are the smallest odd or even numbers in the input.\n\nTo verify this hypothesis, let's write a Python script to find the smallest odd number in the input list, as the majority of examples seem to select odd numbers.\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_odd(numbers):\n    odd_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n    if odd_numbers:\n        return [min(odd_numbers)]\n    return []\n\ninput_list = [25, 99, 84, 46, 69, 38, 97, 52, 22]\noutput = find_smallest_odd(input_list)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if it provides the correct output for the given input.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `[25]`. This suggests that the smallest odd number in the input list `[25, 99, 84, 46, 69, 38, 97, 52, 22]` is `25`. \n\nBased on the pattern observed from the examples, the output for the given input should be the smallest odd number in the list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[25]>>>"
