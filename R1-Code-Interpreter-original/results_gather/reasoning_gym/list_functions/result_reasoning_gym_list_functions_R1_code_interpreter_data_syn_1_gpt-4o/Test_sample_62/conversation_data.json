    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [16, 36, 39, 56, 3] -> Output: [56, 39, 36, 16, 3]\n2. Input: [48, 40, 55, 77, 36, 69, 3, 56, 2, 96] -> Output: [96, 77, 69, 56, 55, 48, 40, 36, 3, 2]\n3. Input: [46, 59, 45, 28, 86, 93, 6, 53, 60] -> Output: [93, 86, 60, 59, 53, 46, 45, 28, 6]\n4. Input: [34, 17, 12, 86, 39] -> Output: [86, 39, 34, 17, 12]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the output list is a sorted version of the input list in descending order. \n\nTo apply this rule to the new input [89, 36, 10, 48, 56, 81, 45, 6, 70, 100], we need to sort the list in descending order. Let's write a Python script to perform this operation.\n\n```python\n# Input list\ninput_list = [89, 36, 10, 48, 56, 81, 45, 6, 70, 100]\n\n# Sort the list in descending order\noutput_list = sorted(input_list, reverse=True)\n\n# Print the output list\nprint(output_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and sorted the input list in descending order. Based on the pattern identified from the examples, the output for the given input [89, 36, 10, 48, 56, 81, 45, 6, 70, 100] is:\n\n<<<[100, 89, 81, 70, 56, 48, 45, 36, 10, 6]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
