    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [52, 6, 76, 76] -> Output: [53, 6, 76, 77]\n2. Input: [82, 67, 20, 75, 69, 5] -> Output: [83, 67, 20, 75, 69, 6]\n3. Input: [9, 41, 81] -> Output: [10, 41, 82]\n4. Input: [4, 18, 71] -> Output: [5, 18, 72]\n\nObservations:\n- The first element of the input list is incremented by 1 in the output list.\n- The last element of the input list is also incremented by 1 in the output list.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nBased on this pattern, we can apply the same transformation to the new input list [68, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 91].\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_list(input_list):\n    if not input_list:\n        return input_list\n    # Increment the first and last elements by 1\n    input_list[0] += 1\n    input_list[-1] += 1\n    return input_list\n\n# Given input\ninput_data = [68, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 91]\n# Transform the input data\noutput_data = transform_list(input_data)\nprint(output_data)\n```\n\nThis code will increment the first and last elements of the input list by 1, while keeping the other elements unchanged. Let's execute this code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected transformation based on the identified pattern. The first and last elements of the input list have been incremented by 1, while the other elements remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the given input [68, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 91] is:\n\n<<<[69, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 92]>>>"
