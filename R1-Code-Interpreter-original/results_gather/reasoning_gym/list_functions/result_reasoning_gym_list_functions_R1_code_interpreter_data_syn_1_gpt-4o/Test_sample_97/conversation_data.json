    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input 1: 6 -> Output 1: 8\n2. Input 2: 87 -> Output 2: 170\n3. Input 3: 77 -> Output 3: 150\n4. Input 4: 13 -> Output 4: 22\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is approximately double the input, but not exactly. Let's calculate the difference between the output and twice the input for each example:\n\n- For Input 1: 6, Output 1: 8\n  - 2 * 6 = 12, Difference = 8 - 12 = -4\n\n- For Input 2: 87, Output 2: 170\n  - 2 * 87 = 174, Difference = 170 - 174 = -4\n\n- For Input 3: 77, Output 3: 150\n  - 2 * 77 = 154, Difference = 150 - 154 = -4\n\n- For Input 4: 13, Output 4: 22\n  - 2 * 13 = 26, Difference = 22 - 26 = -4\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the output is twice the input minus 4. Let's apply this rule to the new input, 80.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the output for the input 80 using the identified pattern\ninput_value = 80\noutput_value = 2 * input_value - 4\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output for the input 80 based on the identified pattern.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output 156 for the input 80. Based on the pattern identified, the output is calculated as twice the input minus 4. Therefore, the final answer for the input 80 is:\n\n<<<156>>>"
