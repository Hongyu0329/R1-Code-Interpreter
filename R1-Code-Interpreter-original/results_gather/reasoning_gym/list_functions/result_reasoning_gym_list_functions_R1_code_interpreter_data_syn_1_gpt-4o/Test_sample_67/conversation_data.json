  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [49, 26, 77, 23, 30, 32, 18, 98, 12]\nOutput 1: [12, 18, 23, 26, 30, 32, 49, 77, 98]\nInput 2: [94, 50, 68, 88, 90, 69, 12]\nOutput 2: [12, 50, 68, 69, 88, 90, 94]\nInput 3: [26, 54, 93, 79, 76, 28, 48, 50, 88, 28]\nOutput 3: [26, 28, 28, 48, 50, 54, 76, 79, 88, 93]\nInput 4: [60, 85, 23, 73, 44]\nOutput 4: [23, 44, 60, 73, 85]\n\n\nInput: [92, 68, 87, 100]\nOutput:\n",

    "The task is to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Observing the examples, the rule appears to be sorting the list of numbers in ascending order.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input list [92, 68, 87, 100].\n\nTo confirm this, I will write a Python script to sort the list in ascending order.\n\n```python\n# Define the input list\ninput_list = [92, 68, 87, 100]\n\n# Sort the list in ascending order\nsorted_list = sorted(input_list)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sorted list, which is the expected output.",
    "The code has successfully sorted the input list [92, 68, 87, 100] in ascending order. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, the sorted list is the correct output.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[68, 87, 92, 100]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
