    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: 97 -> Output: 190\n2. Input: 44 -> Output: 84\n3. Input: 63 -> Output: 122\n4. Input: 24 -> Output: 44\n\nLet's try to find a mathematical relationship between the input and output values. \n\n- For Input 1: 97 -> 190\n  - The difference is 190 - 97 = 93\n\n- For Input 2: 44 -> 84\n  - The difference is 84 - 44 = 40\n\n- For Input 3: 63 -> 122\n  - The difference is 122 - 63 = 59\n\n- For Input 4: 24 -> 44\n  - The difference is 44 - 24 = 20\n\nThe differences are 93, 40, 59, and 20. Let's see if there's a consistent pattern or formula that can be applied to these differences.\n\nOne possible approach is to check if the differences are related to the input values in a linear way, such as a constant addition or multiplication. Let's try to find a linear relationship:\n\nLet's assume the output is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Output} = a \\times \\text{Input} + b \\]\n\nWe can use the given examples to solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nLet's use Python to solve this system of equations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\na, b = symbols('a b')\n\n# Define the equations based on the examples\neq1 = Eq(a * 97 + b, 190)\neq2 = Eq(a * 44 + b, 84)\neq3 = Eq(a * 63 + b, 122)\neq4 = Eq(a * 24 + b, 44)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, b))\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).",
    "The solution to the system of equations indicates that the relationship between the input and output can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times \\text{Input} - 4 \\]\n\nLet's verify this formula with the given examples:\n\n1. For Input 97: \n   \\[ 2 \\times 97 - 4 = 194 - 4 = 190 \\] (Matches Output 190)\n\n2. For Input 44: \n   \\[ 2 \\times 44 - 4 = 88 - 4 = 84 \\] (Matches Output 84)\n\n3. For Input 63: \n   \\[ 2 \\times 63 - 4 = 126 - 4 = 122 \\] (Matches Output 122)\n\n4. For Input 24: \n   \\[ 2 \\times 24 - 4 = 48 - 4 = 44 \\] (Matches Output 44)\n\nThe formula works for all the given examples. Now, let's apply this formula to the new input, 43:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times 43 - 4 = 86 - 4 = 82 \\]\n\nTherefore, the output for the input 43 is 82.\n\n<<<[82]>>>"
