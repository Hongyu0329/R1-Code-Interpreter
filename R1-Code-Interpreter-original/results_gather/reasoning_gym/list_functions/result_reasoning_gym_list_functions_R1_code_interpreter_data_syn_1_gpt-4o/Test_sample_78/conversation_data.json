Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [77, 32, 53, 62, 92, 36, 82, 70, 89]\nOutput 1: [32, 36, 53, 62, 70, 77, 82, 89, 92]\nInput 2: [70, 54, 65, 41]\nOutput 2: [41, 54, 65, 70]\nInput 3: [15, 66, 11]\nOutput 3: [11, 15, 66]\nInput 4: [57, 81, 2, 68, 55]\nOutput 4: [2, 55, 57, 68, 81]\n\n\nInput: [36, 37, 47, 47, 65, 14]\nOutput:\n",

    "The task is to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Observing the examples, it is clear that the rule is to sort the list of numbers in ascending order.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the provided input list `[36, 37, 47, 47, 65, 14]`.\n\nTo achieve this, I will write a Python script to sort the list in ascending order.\n\n```python\n# Input list\ninput_list = [36, 37, 47, 47, 65, 14]\n\n# Sorting the list in ascending order\nsorted_list = sorted(input_list)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and sorted the input list in ascending order. The sorted list is `[14, 36, 37, 47, 47, 65]`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[14, 36, 37, 47, 47, 65]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are an expert at inductive reasoning.
