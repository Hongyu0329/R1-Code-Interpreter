Let's try another approach.\n\nAnother observation is that the output number is the smallest number in the input list that is greater than 10. Let's verify this:\n- Example 1: The smallest number greater than 10 is 14, but the output is 15. This contradicts the hypothesis.\n- Example 2: The smallest number greater than 10 is 13, but the output is 75.
