    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [97]\n   - Output: [190]\n   - Analysis: The output is 190. If we look at the difference, 190 - 97 = 93.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [44]\n   - Output: [84]\n   - Analysis: The output is 84. The difference is 84 - 44 = 40.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [63]\n   - Output: [122]\n   - Analysis: The output is 122. The difference is 122 - 63 = 59.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [24]\n   - Output: [44]\n   - Analysis: The output is 44. The difference is 44 - 24 = 20.\n\nNow, let's try to find a consistent pattern or rule:\n\n- The differences between the output and input are: 93, 40, 59, and 20.\n- These differences do not form a simple arithmetic sequence or a consistent pattern at first glance.\n\nLet's consider another approach by examining the relationship between the input and output:\n\n- For each example, the output seems to be approximately double the input, but not exactly. Let's check this:\n  - For input 97, double is 194, and the output is 190 (close to double).\n  - For input 44, double is 88, and the output is 84 (close to double).\n  - For input 63, double is 126, and the output is 122 (close to double).\n  - For input 24, double is 48, and the output is 44 (close to double).\n\nIt seems the output is slightly less than double the input. Let's try to find a consistent rule:\n\n- If we calculate the output as double the input minus a small adjustment:\n  - For input 97: 2 * 97 - 4 = 190\n  - For input 44: 2 * 44 - 4 = 84\n  - For input 63: 2 * 63 - 4 = 122\n  - For input 24: 2 * 24 - 4 = 44\n\nThe rule seems to be: Output = 2 * Input - 4\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input: [43]**\n  - Calculate: 2 * 43 - 4 = 86 - 4 = 82\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [43] is:\n\n<<<[82]>>>"
