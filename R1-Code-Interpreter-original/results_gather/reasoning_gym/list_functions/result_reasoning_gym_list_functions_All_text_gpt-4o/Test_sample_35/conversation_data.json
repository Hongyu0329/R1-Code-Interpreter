    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the given input list to the output. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [15, 53, 60, 99]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The numbers in the list are a mix of odd and even numbers. The output is 1.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [83, 80, 77, 63, 55, 36, 35, 27, 6]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The numbers in the list are a mix of odd and even numbers. The output is 0.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [5, 21, 24, 37, 57]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The numbers in the list are a mix of odd and even numbers. The output is 1.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [88, 63, 40, 13]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The numbers in the list are a mix of odd and even numbers. The output is 0.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The output seems to be determined by some property of the numbers in the list.\n- Let's consider the parity (odd or even) of the numbers:\n  - In Example 1, there are 2 odd numbers (15, 99) and 2 even numbers (53, 60). The output is 1.\n  - In Example 2, there are 6 odd numbers (83, 77, 63, 55, 35, 27) and 3 even numbers (80, 36, 6). The output is 0.\n  - In Example 3, there are 4 odd numbers (5, 21, 37, 57) and 1 even number (24). The output is 1.\n  - In Example 4, there are 2 odd numbers (63, 13) and 2 even numbers (88, 40). The output is 0.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n- The output is 1 if the list contains more odd numbers than even numbers.\n- The output is 0 if the list contains more even numbers than odd numbers or if the count of odd and even numbers is equal.\n\n**Applying the rule to the given input:**\n- Input: [2, 51, 52, 76, 84, 96]\n- Count of odd numbers: 1 (51)\n- Count of even numbers: 5 (2, 52, 76, 84, 96)\n\nSince there are more even numbers than odd numbers, the output should be 0.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[0]>>>"
