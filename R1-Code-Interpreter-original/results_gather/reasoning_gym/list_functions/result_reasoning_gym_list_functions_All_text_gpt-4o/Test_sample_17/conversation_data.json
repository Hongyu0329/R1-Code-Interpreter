    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [45, 53, 15, 42]\n   - Output: [46, 53, 15, 43]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [88, 6, 98]\n   - Output: [89, 6, 99]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [20, 59, 94, 6, 81, 70, 65]\n   - Output: [21, 59, 94, 6, 81, 70, 66]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [78, 37, 74, 48, 52, 4]\n   - Output: [79, 37, 74, 48, 52, 5]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can deduce the rule:\n- The first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1 to produce the output list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [93, 18, 13, 55, 94, 49]\n- Increment the first element (93) by 1 to get 94.\n- Increment the last element (49) by 1 to get 50.\n- The other elements remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the output list is: [94, 18, 13, 55, 94, 50]\n\nFinal answer: <<<[94, 18, 13, 55, 94, 50]>>>"
