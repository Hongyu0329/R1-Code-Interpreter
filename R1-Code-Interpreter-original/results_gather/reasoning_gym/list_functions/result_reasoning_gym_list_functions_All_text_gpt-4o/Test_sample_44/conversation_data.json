    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps each input list to its corresponding output list. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [60, 50, 26, 39, 7, 54, 31, 37]\n   - Output: [60, 51, 28, 42, 11, 59, 37, 44]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 60 → 60 (no change)\n     - 50 → 51 (+1)\n     - 26 → 28 (+2)\n     - 39 → 42 (+3)\n     - 7 → 11 (+4)\n     - 54 → 59 (+5)\n     - 31 → 37 (+6)\n     - 37 → 44 (+7)\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [97, 57, 63, 30, 11, 43, 39]\n   - Output: [97, 58, 65, 33, 15, 48, 45]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 97 → 97 (no change)\n     - 57 → 58 (+1)\n     - 63 → 65 (+2)\n     - 30 → 33 (+3)\n     - 11 → 15 (+4)\n     - 43 → 48 (+5)\n     - 39 → 45 (+6)\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [43, 69, 8, 1, 85, 53]\n   - Output: [43, 70, 10, 4, 89, 58]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 43 → 43 (no change)\n     - 69 → 70 (+1)\n     - 8 → 10 (+2)\n     - 1 → 4 (+3)\n     - 85 → 89 (+4)\n     - 53 → 58 (+5)\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [96, 31, 43, 70, 59, 4, 9, 85, 81]\n   - Output: [96, 32, 45, 73, 63, 9, 15, 92, 89]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 96 → 96 (no change)\n     - 31 → 32 (+1)\n     - 43 → 45 (+2)\n     - 70 → 73 (+3)\n     - 59 → 63 (+4)\n     - 4 → 9 (+5)\n     - 9 → 15 (+6)\n     - 85 → 92 (+7)\n     - 81 → 89 (+8)\n\n**Identified Pattern:**\n- The first element remains unchanged.\n- For each subsequent element, the increment increases by 1 compared to the previous element's increment.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the New Input:**\n- Input: [20, 13, 32, 82, 98, 83, 12, 95, 92]\n- Output:\n  - 20 → 20 (no change)\n  - 13 → 14 (+1)\n  - 32 → 34 (+2)\n  - 82 → 85 (+3)\n  - 98 → 102 (+4)\n  - 83 → 88 (+5)\n  - 12 → 18 (+6)\n  - 95 → 102 (+7)\n  - 92 → 100 (+8)\n\nFinal Output: <<<[20, 14, 34, 85, 102, 88, 18, 102, 100]>>>"
