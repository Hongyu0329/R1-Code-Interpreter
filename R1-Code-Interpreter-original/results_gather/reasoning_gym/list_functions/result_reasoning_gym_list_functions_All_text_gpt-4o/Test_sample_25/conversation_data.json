    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [48, 76, 78]\n   - Output: [78]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [29, 66, 42]\n   - Output: [42]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [38, 56, 82, 49, 3, 95, 22, 67, 78, 48]\n   - Output: [82]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [51, 14, 84, 93, 75, 88, 63, 70, 33]\n   - Output: [84]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the input list.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule is to select the largest number from the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [73, 19, 18, 49, 72]\n- The largest number in this list is 73.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[73]>>>"
