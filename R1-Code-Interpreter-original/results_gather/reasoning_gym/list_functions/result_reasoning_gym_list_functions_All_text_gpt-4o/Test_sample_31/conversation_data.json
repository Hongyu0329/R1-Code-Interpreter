    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [57, 38, 33, 62, 85, 12, 50, 96, 11, 10]\n   - Output: [10, 11, 96, 50, 12, 85, 62, 33, 38, 57]\n   - Analysis: The output list seems to be a rearrangement of the input list. The smallest numbers appear first, followed by the largest numbers, alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [38, 10, 81, 40, 96, 79]\n   - Output: [79, 96, 40, 81, 10, 38]\n   - Analysis: The output starts with the largest number, then the second largest, followed by the smallest, then the second smallest, and so on.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [29, 85, 17]\n   - Output: [17, 85, 29]\n   - Analysis: The output starts with the smallest number, then the largest, followed by the middle number.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [31, 36, 77, 87, 4, 5, 77, 92]\n   - Output: [92, 77, 5, 4, 87, 77, 36, 31]\n   - Analysis: The output starts with the largest number, then the second largest, followed by the smallest, then the second smallest, and so on.\n\nFrom these analyses, we can deduce the rule:\n- The output list is formed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining numbers from the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [30, 98, 79, 72, 55]\n- Sort the input list: [30, 55, 72, 79, 98]\n- Start with the largest: 98\n- Next smallest: 30\n- Next largest: 79\n- Next smallest: 55\n- Next largest: 72\n\nFollowing this pattern, the output list is: [98, 30, 79, 55, 72]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<[98, 30, 79, 55, 72]>>>"
