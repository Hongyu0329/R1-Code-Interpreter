    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [29, 77, 39, 73, 95, 24]\n   - Output: [24, 95, 73, 39, 77, 29]\n   - Observation: The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [20, 78, 40, 79, 81, 1, 10, 91]\n   - Output: [91, 10, 1, 81, 79, 40, 78, 20]\n   - Observation: The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [61, 65, 86, 54, 82]\n   - Output: [82, 54, 86, 65, 61]\n   - Observation: The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [97, 33, 38, 21]\n   - Output: [21, 38, 33, 97]\n   - Observation: The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule applied to transform the input list to the output list is simply reversing the order of the elements in the list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [24, 63, 19, 7, 36, 91, 78, 81, 69, 55]\n- **Output:** Reverse the input list to get the output.\n\nReversing the input list [24, 63, 19, 7, 36, 91, 78, 81, 69, 55] gives us [55, 69, 81, 78, 91, 36, 7, 19, 63, 24].\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[55, 69, 81, 78, 91, 36, 7, 19, 63, 24]>>>"
