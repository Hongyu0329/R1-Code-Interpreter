    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [77, 39, 10, 94, 47, 1]\n   - Output: [39]\n   - Observation: 39 is the smallest number in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [86, 94, 76, 21, 14, 39, 58, 92, 31, 6]\n   - Output: [58]\n   - Observation: 58 is the largest number in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [93, 81, 19, 99, 43, 36, 100, 61, 6]\n   - Output: [100]\n   - Observation: 100 is the largest number in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [67, 82, 58, 0]\n   - Output: [67]\n   - Observation: 67 is the smallest number in the list.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that the rule is not consistent in terms of always picking the smallest or the largest number. However, it seems to alternate between choosing the smallest and the largest number based on the examples provided.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input: [37, 48, 80, 6, 70, 41, 51, 56, 19, 5]**\n\nFollowing the pattern:\n- Example 1 chose the smallest number.\n- Example 2 chose the largest number.\n- Example 3 chose the largest number.\n- Example 4 chose the smallest number.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next choice should be the largest number.\n\n- The largest number in the list [37, 48, 80, 6, 70, 41, 51, 56, 19, 5] is 80.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input should be:\n\n<<<[80]>>>"
