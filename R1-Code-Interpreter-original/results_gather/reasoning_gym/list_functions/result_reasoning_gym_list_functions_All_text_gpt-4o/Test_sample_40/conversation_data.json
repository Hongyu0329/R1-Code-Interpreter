    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [77, 95, 24, 45]\n   - Output: [241]\n   - Analysis: The output is the sum of all the numbers in the input list: 77 + 95 + 24 + 45 = 241.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [40, 95, 92, 88, 77, 17, 90, 89]\n   - Output: [588]\n   - Analysis: The output is the sum of all the numbers in the input list: 40 + 95 + 92 + 88 + 77 + 17 + 90 + 89 = 588.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [30, 49, 19, 82, 4, 89, 29, 59]\n   - Output: [361]\n   - Analysis: The output is the sum of all the numbers in the input list: 30 + 49 + 19 + 82 + 4 + 89 + 29 + 59 = 361.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [58, 9, 99]\n   - Output: [166]\n   - Analysis: The output is the sum of all the numbers in the input list: 58 + 9 + 99 = 166.\n\nFrom the analysis of these examples, we can deduce that the rule is to sum all the elements in the input list to produce the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [12, 65, 41, 93, 3, 54, 33]\n- **Calculation:** 12 + 65 + 41 + 93 + 3 + 54 + 33 = 301\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<301>>>"
