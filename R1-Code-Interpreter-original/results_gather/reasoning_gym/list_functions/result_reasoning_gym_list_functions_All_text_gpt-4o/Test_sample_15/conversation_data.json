    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [9, 56, 71, 59, 74, 44, 33, 66]\n   - Output: [66, 33, 44, 74, 59, 71, 56, 9]\n   - Observation: The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [51, 79, 6, 54, 85, 4, 14, 1, 34]\n   - Output: [34, 1, 14, 4, 85, 54, 6, 79, 51]\n   - Observation: The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [93, 70, 2, 41, 73, 55, 30, 31, 67, 66]\n   - Output: [66, 67, 31, 30, 55, 73, 41, 2, 70, 93]\n   - Observation: The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [57, 31, 5, 72, 48, 92, 89, 46]\n   - Output: [46, 89, 92, 48, 72, 5, 31, 57]\n   - Observation: The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can deduce that the rule is to reverse the input list to get the output list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [72, 74, 98, 26, 31, 94, 5, 17]\n- **Output:** Reverse the input list to get the output.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[17, 5, 94, 31, 26, 98, 74, 72]>>>"
