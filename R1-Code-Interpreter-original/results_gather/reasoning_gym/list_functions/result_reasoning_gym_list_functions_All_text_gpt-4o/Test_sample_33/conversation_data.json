    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input sequence to the output. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - In each example, the sequence is a list of numbers.\n   - Each number in the sequence is double the previous number. This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.\n\n2. **Determine the Next Number:**\n   - The output is the next number in the sequence, which is obtained by multiplying the last number in the input sequence by 2.\n\n3. **Apply the Pattern to the Given Input:**\n   - Given Input: [98, 196, 392, 784, 1568, 3136, 6272, 12544, 25088, 50176]\n   - The last number in the sequence is 50176.\n   - To find the next number, multiply 50176 by 2.\n\n4. **Calculate the Output:**\n   - 50176 * 2 = 100352\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is the next number in the sequence:\n\n<<<[100352]>>>"
