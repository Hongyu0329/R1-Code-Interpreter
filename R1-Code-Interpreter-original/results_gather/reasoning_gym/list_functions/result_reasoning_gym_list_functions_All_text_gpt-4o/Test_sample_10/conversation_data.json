    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [95]\n   - Output: [186]\n   - Analysis: The output is 186. If we look at the difference between 186 and 95, it is 91.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [28]\n   - Output: [52]\n   - Analysis: The output is 52. The difference between 52 and 28 is 24.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [98]\n   - Output: [192]\n   - Analysis: The output is 192. The difference between 192 and 98 is 94.\n\nNow, let's try to identify a pattern or rule from these differences:\n- For Input 1, the difference is 91.\n- For Input 2, the difference is 24.\n- For Input 3, the difference is 94.\n\nThe differences do not follow a simple arithmetic pattern, so let's consider another approach. Let's examine the relationship between the input and output directly:\n- For Input 1: 95 * 2 - 4 = 190 - 4 = 186\n- For Input 2: 28 * 2 - 4 = 56 - 4 = 52\n- For Input 3: 98 * 2 - 4 = 196 - 4 = 192\n\nThe pattern seems to be: multiply the input by 2 and then subtract 4 to get the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input: [20]**\n  - Calculation: 20 * 2 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [20] is 36.\n\nFinal answer: <<<[36]>>>"
