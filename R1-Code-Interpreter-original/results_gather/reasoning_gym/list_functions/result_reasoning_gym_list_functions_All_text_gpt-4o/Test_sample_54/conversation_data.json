    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [72, 41, 96]\n   - Output: [96, 72, 41]\n   - Analysis: The output is the input list sorted in descending order.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [99, 9, 91]\n   - Output: [99, 91, 9]\n   - Analysis: The output is the input list sorted in descending order.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [93, 49, 14, 65, 13, 53, 59]\n   - Output: [93, 65, 59, 53, 49, 14, 13]\n   - Analysis: The output is the input list sorted in descending order.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [75, 99, 98]\n   - Output: [99, 98, 75]\n   - Analysis: The output is the input list sorted in descending order.\n\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can deduce that the rule is to sort the input list in descending order.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [27, 47, 8, 23, 51, 37]\n- **Step 1:** Sort the list in descending order.\n- **Sorted List:** [51, 47, 37, 27, 23, 8]\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is the sorted list in descending order.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[51, 47, 37, 27, 23, 8]>>>"
