    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [52, 66, 47, 18, 62, 4]\n   - Output: [53, 66, 47, 18, 62, 5]\n   - Observation: The first and last elements are incremented by 1.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [41, 82, 70, 33, 81]\n   - Output: [42, 82, 70, 33, 82]\n   - Observation: The first and last elements are incremented by 1.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [9, 100, 15, 4, 38, 98, 48]\n   - Output: [10, 100, 15, 4, 38, 98, 49]\n   - Observation: The first and last elements are incremented by 1.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [92, 83, 57, 22]\n   - Output: [93, 83, 57, 23]\n   - Observation: The first and last elements are incremented by 1.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the rule:\n- The first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1 to form the output list. All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [67, 46, 61, 42, 64, 42, 68, 45, 53]\n- **Step 1:** Increment the first element (67) by 1 → 68\n- **Step 2:** Increment the last element (53) by 1 → 54\n- **Step 3:** Keep all other elements the same: [46, 61, 42, 64, 42, 68, 45]\n\nThus, the output list is: [68, 46, 61, 42, 64, 42, 68, 45, 54]\n\nFinal answer: <<<[68, 46, 61, 42, 64, 42, 68, 45, 54]>>>"
