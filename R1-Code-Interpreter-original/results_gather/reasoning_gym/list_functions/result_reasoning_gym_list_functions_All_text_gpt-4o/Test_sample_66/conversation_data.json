    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [845]\n   - Output: [0]\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [460]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [3955]\n   - Output: [0]\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [740]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Look at the last digit of each input number.\n  - For 845, the last digit is 5.\n  - For 460, the last digit is 0.\n  - For 3955, the last digit is 5.\n  - For 740, the last digit is 0.\n\n- **Step 2:** Check the output corresponding to the last digit.\n  - If the last digit is 5, the output is 0.\n  - If the last digit is 0, the output is 1.\n\n**Rule Identification:**\n- The output is determined by the last digit of the input number:\n  - If the last digit is 5, the output is [0].\n  - If the last digit is 0, the output is [1].\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Given Input:**\n\n- **Input:** [4105]\n- **Last Digit:** 5\n\nAccording to the rule, if the last digit is 5, the output should be [0].\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [4105] is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
