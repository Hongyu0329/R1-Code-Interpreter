    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [1895]\n   - Output: [0]\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [50]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [1135]\n   - Output: [0]\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [370]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- We need to determine what characteristic or property of the input number results in an output of either 0 or 1.\n- Let's consider the possibility of a pattern based on divisibility, parity, or some other numerical property.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- **Input 1 (1895) and Input 3 (1135):** Both numbers result in an output of 0. \n  - Both numbers are odd.\n  - Both numbers are not divisible by 10.\n\n- **Input 2 (50) and Input 4 (370):** Both numbers result in an output of 1.\n  - Both numbers are even.\n  - Both numbers are divisible by 10.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\n- The output is 1 if the number is divisible by 10 (i.e., ends in 0).\n- The output is 0 if the number is not divisible by 10.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- For Input 1 (1895), the number is not divisible by 10, so the output is 0.\n- For Input 2 (50), the number is divisible by 10, so the output is 1.\n- For Input 3 (1135), the number is not divisible by 10, so the output is 0.\n- For Input 4 (370), the number is divisible by 10, so the output is 1.\n\n**Application to the Given Input:**\n\n- **Input: [2265]**\n  - The number 2265 is not divisible by 10 (it does not end in 0).\n\nTherefore, based on our hypothesis, the output for the input [2265] should be 0.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0>>>"
