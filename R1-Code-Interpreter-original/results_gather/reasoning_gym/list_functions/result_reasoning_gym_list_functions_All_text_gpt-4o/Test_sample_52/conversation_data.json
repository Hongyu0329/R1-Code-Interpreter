    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1: [100, 5, 63, 1, 67, 85, 41] -> [63]**\n   - The output is 63, which is the third element in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2: [59, 64, 71, 97, 95, 47] -> [71]**\n   - The output is 71, which is the third element in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3: [70, 97, 92, 34, 68] -> [92]**\n   - The output is 92, which is the third element in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4: [52, 93, 43, 78, 29, 17, 85, 61, 6, 66] -> [43]**\n   - The output is 43, which is the third element in the list.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce that the rule is to select the third element from the input list as the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n**Input: [20, 6, 64]**\n\n- The third element in the list is 64.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[64]>>>"
