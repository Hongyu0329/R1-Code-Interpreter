    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 84\n   - Output: 164\n   - Analysis: The output is 164, which is 80 more than the input (84 + 80 = 164).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 48\n   - Output: 92\n   - Analysis: The output is 92, which is 44 more than the input (48 + 44 = 92).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 98\n   - Output: 192\n   - Analysis: The output is 192, which is 94 more than the input (98 + 94 = 192).\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: 88\n   - Output: 172\n   - Analysis: The output is 172, which is 84 more than the input (88 + 84 = 172).\n\nFrom these examples, we observe that the output is consistently greater than the input by a certain amount. Let's calculate the difference for each example:\n\n- For input 84, the difference is 80.\n- For input 48, the difference is 44.\n- For input 98, the difference is 94.\n- For input 88, the difference is 84.\n\nNow, let's try to find a pattern in these differences:\n\n- The differences (80, 44, 94, 84) do not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence. However, they seem to be close to the input values themselves, suggesting a possible relationship.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the output is approximately double the input, minus a small adjustment:\n\n- For input 84, double is 168, and the output is 164 (168 - 4).\n- For input 48, double is 96, and the output is 92 (96 - 4).\n- For input 98, double is 196, and the output is 192 (196 - 4).\n- For input 88, double is 176, and the output is 172 (176 - 4).\n\nThe pattern appears to be: Output = 2 * Input - 4.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- Input: 72\n- Double the input: 72 * 2 = 144\n- Subtract 4: 144 - 4 = 140\n\nTherefore, the output for the input 72 is 140.\n\nFinal answer: <<<140>>>"
