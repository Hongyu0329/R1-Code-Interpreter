    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [25, 43, 24, 81, 2, 68, 99, 90, 2]\n   - Output: [43, 81, 2, 99, 90]\n   - Analysis: The output list contains elements from the input list that are either prime numbers or numbers that appear more than once in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [88, 60, 18, 29, 16, 89, 18, 78]\n   - Output: [88, 60, 29, 89, 18]\n   - Analysis: The output list contains elements from the input list that are either prime numbers or numbers that appear more than once in the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [57, 53, 42, 86, 56]\n   - Output: [53, 42, 86]\n   - Analysis: The output list contains elements from the input list that are either prime numbers or numbers that appear more than once in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [40, 21, 16, 60, 44]\n   - Output: [21, 16, 60]\n   - Analysis: The output list contains elements from the input list that are either prime numbers or numbers that appear more than once in the input list.\n\nFrom the analysis, the rule seems to be:\n- Include numbers that are prime.\n- Include numbers that appear more than once in the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [20, 32, 57]\n  - 20: Not a prime number, appears once.\n  - 32: Not a prime number, appears once.\n  - 57: Not a prime number, appears once.\n\nNone of the numbers in the input list are prime, and none appear more than once. Therefore, the output list will be empty.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[]>>>"
