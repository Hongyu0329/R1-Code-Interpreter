    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [73, 13, 44, 86, 32, 81]\n   - Output: [73, 13, 44, 86, 32, 81]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [20, 67, 68]\n   - Output: [20, 67, 68]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [75, 9, 69, 48, 44, 91, 14]\n   - Output: [75, 9, 69, 48, 44, 91, 14]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [60, 51, 15, 77]\n   - Output: [60, 51, 15, 77]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce that the rule is to output the list exactly as it is given in the input. There is no transformation or filtering applied to the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Given Input:**\n  - [48, 68, 96, 87, 56, 80, 59]\n\nAccording to the identified rule, the output should be the same as the input.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[48, 68, 96, 87, 56, 80, 59]>>>"
