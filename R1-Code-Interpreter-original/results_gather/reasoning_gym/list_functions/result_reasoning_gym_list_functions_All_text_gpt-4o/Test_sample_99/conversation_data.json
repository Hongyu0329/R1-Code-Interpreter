    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the given input list to the output. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [3, 12, 37, 48, 50, 51, 66, 99]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The list contains both even and odd numbers. The output is 1.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [77, 73, 45, 13]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The list contains only odd numbers. The output is 0.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [29, 71, 88, 89, 90]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The list contains both even and odd numbers. The output is 1.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [96, 94, 93, 70, 63, 58, 29, 26, 22, 7]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The list contains both even and odd numbers. The output is 0.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- If the list contains both even and odd numbers, the output is 1.\n- If the list contains only odd numbers, the output is 0.\n- If the list contains only even numbers, the output is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [2, 9, 56, 83, 95, 95]\n  - The list contains both even (2, 56) and odd numbers (9, 83, 95, 95).\n\nAccording to the rule, since the list contains both even and odd numbers, the output should be 1.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
