    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1: [87, 79, 46, 22, 71] -> [22]**\n   - The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2: [50, 38, 80, 55, 73] -> [0]**\n   - The output is 0, which is not present in the list. The smallest number in the list is 38, but the output is 0.\n\n3. **Example 3: [93, 68, 70] -> [0]**\n   - The output is 0, which is not present in the list. The smallest number in the list is 68, but the output is 0.\n\n4. **Example 4: [95, 49, 57, 30, 66] -> [0]**\n   - The output is 0, which is not present in the list. The smallest number in the list is 30, but the output is 0.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- If the smallest number in the list is less than or equal to 25, the output is that smallest number.\n- If the smallest number in the list is greater than 25, the output is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n**Input: [11, 7, 89, 24, 78]**\n- The smallest number in the list is 7.\n- Since 7 is less than or equal to 25, according to the rule, the output should be 7.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
