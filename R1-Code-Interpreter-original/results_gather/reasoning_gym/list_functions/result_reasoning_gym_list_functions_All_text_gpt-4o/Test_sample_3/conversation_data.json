    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input sequence to the output. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - In each example, the sequence is a series of numbers that appear to be doubling.\n   - For instance, in Input 1: [97, 194, 388, 776, 1552, 3104, 6208, 12416], each number is double the previous one.\n   - The output is the next number in the sequence, which is also double the last number in the input sequence.\n\n2. **Apply the Pattern:**\n   - For Input 1, the last number is 12416, and the output is 24832, which is 12416 * 2.\n   - For Input 2, the last number is 5376, and the output is 10752, which is 5376 * 2.\n   - For Input 3, the last number is 372, and the output is 744, which is 372 * 2.\n   - For Input 4, the last number is 176, and the output is 352, which is 176 * 2.\n\n3. **Apply the Pattern to the Given Input:**\n   - Given Input: [31, 62, 124]\n   - The last number in the sequence is 124.\n   - According to the identified pattern, the output should be the next number in the sequence, which is 124 * 2.\n\n4. **Calculate the Output:**\n   - 124 * 2 = 248\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input [31, 62, 124] is:\n\n<<<[248]>>>"
