    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [25]\n   - Output: [46]\n   - Analysis: The difference between 46 and 25 is 21.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [29]\n   - Output: [54]\n   - Analysis: The difference between 54 and 29 is 25.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [17]\n   - Output: [30]\n   - Analysis: The difference between 30 and 17 is 13.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [58]\n   - Output: [112]\n   - Analysis: The difference between 112 and 58 is 54.\n\nNext, let's try to find a consistent pattern or rule that applies to all these examples:\n\n- Calculate the difference between the output and input for each example:\n  - Example 1: 46 - 25 = 21\n  - Example 2: 54 - 29 = 25\n  - Example 3: 30 - 17 = 13\n  - Example 4: 112 - 58 = 54\n\n- The differences are: 21, 25, 13, 54.\n\n- There doesn't seem to be a simple arithmetic pattern (like a constant difference or a simple arithmetic sequence) in these differences.\n\n- Let's consider another approach: check if the output is a result of some operation on the input, such as multiplication, division, or a combination of operations.\n\n- Upon further inspection, it seems that the output is approximately double the input, but not exactly. Let's check this hypothesis:\n  - Example 1: 25 * 2 = 50, but the output is 46 (close, but not exact).\n  - Example 2: 29 * 2 = 58, but the output is 54 (close, but not exact).\n  - Example 3: 17 * 2 = 34, but the output is 30 (close, but not exact).\n  - Example 4: 58 * 2 = 116, but the output is 112 (close, but not exact).\n\n- The output seems to be slightly less than double the input in each case.\n\n- Let's try to find a consistent rule: it appears that the output is the input multiplied by 2, then subtract a small number (which varies).\n\n- Let's apply this reasoning to the new input:\n\n**Input: [1]**\n\n- Calculate: 1 * 2 = 2\n- Since the output is slightly less than double the input, we subtract a small number. In previous examples, this number varied, but it was always small.\n\n- For input 1, let's assume the pattern holds and the output is slightly less than double the input.\n\n- Therefore, the output for input [1] should be slightly less than 2, which is 1.\n\nThus, the output for the input [1] is:\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
