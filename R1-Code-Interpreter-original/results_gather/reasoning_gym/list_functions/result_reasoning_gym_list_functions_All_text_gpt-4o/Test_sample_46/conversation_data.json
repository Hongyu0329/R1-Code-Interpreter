Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [13, 39, 86, 94, 33, 3]\nOutput 1: [94]\nInput 2: [84, 19, 1]\nOutput 2: [19]\nInput 3: [90, 61, 49, 70, 2, 5]\nOutput 3: [5]\nInput 4: [45, 55, 44, 81, 1]\nOutput 4: [55]\n\n\nInput: [100, 97, 47, 47, 1]\nOutput:\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1: [13, 39, 86, 94, 33, 3] -> [94]**\n   - The output is the largest number in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2: [84, 19, 1] -> [19]**\n   - The output is the second largest number in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3: [90, 61, 49, 70, 2, 5] -> [5]**\n   - The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4: [45, 55, 44, 81, 1] -> [55]**\n   - The output is the second largest number in the list.\n\nFrom these examples, we can infer that the rule involves selecting a specific number from the list based on its order when sorted. The rule seems to be:\n- If the list has an even number of elements, select the largest number.\n- If the list has an odd number of elements, select the second largest number.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n**Input: [100, 97, 47, 47, 1]**\n- The list has 5 elements, which is odd.\n- Sort the list: [1, 47, 47, 97, 100]\n- The second largest number is 97.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [100, 97, 47, 47, 1] is:\n\n<<<[97]>>>"
