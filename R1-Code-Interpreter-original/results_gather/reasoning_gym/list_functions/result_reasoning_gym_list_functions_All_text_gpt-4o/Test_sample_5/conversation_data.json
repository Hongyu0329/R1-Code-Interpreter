    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [80, 86, 96, 82]\n   - Output: [81, 86, 96, 83]\n   - Observation: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [81, 48, 57]\n   - Output: [82, 48, 58]\n   - Observation: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [88, 59, 77, 37]\n   - Output: [89, 59, 77, 38]\n   - Observation: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [95, 55, 57, 19, 7, 12, 53, 10, 70]\n   - Output: [96, 55, 57, 19, 7, 12, 53, 10, 71]\n   - Observation: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the rule:\n- The first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1 to produce the output list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [47, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 47]\n- Increment the first element (47) by 1: 48\n- Increment the last element (47) by 1: 48\n- The other elements remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the output list is: [48, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 48]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<[48, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 48]>>>"
