    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input sequence to the output. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - In each example, the sequence is a list of numbers that appear to be doubling.\n   - For instance, in Input 1: [75, 150, 300, 600], each number is double the previous one: 75 * 2 = 150, 150 * 2 = 300, 300 * 2 = 600.\n   - The output is the next number in this doubling sequence: 600 * 2 = 1200.\n\n2. **Apply the Pattern to the New Input:**\n   - Given Input: [42, 84, 168, 336, 672]\n   - Check the pattern: \n     - 42 * 2 = 84\n     - 84 * 2 = 168\n     - 168 * 2 = 336\n     - 336 * 2 = 672\n   - The pattern holds as each number is double the previous one.\n\n3. **Determine the Output:**\n   - To find the output, continue the pattern by doubling the last number in the sequence.\n   - 672 * 2 = 1344\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is the next number in the sequence, which is 1344.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[1344]>>>"
