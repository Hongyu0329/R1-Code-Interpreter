    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [15]\n   - Output: [26]\n   - Analysis: The output is 26. If we look at the difference, 26 - 15 = 11.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [81]\n   - Output: [158]\n   - Analysis: The output is 158. The difference is 158 - 81 = 77.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [25]\n   - Output: [46]\n   - Analysis: The output is 46. The difference is 46 - 25 = 21.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [34]\n   - Output: [64]\n   - Analysis: The output is 64. The difference is 64 - 34 = 30.\n\nNow, let's look for a pattern in the differences:\n- For input 15, the difference is 11.\n- For input 81, the difference is 77.\n- For input 25, the difference is 21.\n- For input 34, the difference is 30.\n\nThe differences themselves do not form a simple arithmetic sequence, so let's consider another approach. Let's check if the differences are related to the input numbers in some way:\n\n- For input 15, the difference 11 is 15 * 0.7333 (approximately).\n- For input 81, the difference 77 is 81 * 0.9506 (approximately).\n- For input 25, the difference 21 is 25 * 0.84 (approximately).\n- For input 34, the difference 30 is 34 * 0.882 (approximately).\n\nThe differences seem to be roughly proportional to the input numbers, but not exactly. Let's try another approach by examining the output values directly:\n\n- For input 15, the output is 26.\n- For input 81, the output is 158.\n- For input 25, the output is 46.\n- For input 34, the output is 64.\n\nIf we look at the outputs, they seem to be approximately double the input values, but not exactly. Let's calculate the ratio of output to input:\n\n- For input 15, 26 / 15 = 1.7333 (approximately).\n- For input 81, 158 / 81 = 1.9506 (approximately).\n- For input 25, 46 / 25 = 1.84 (approximately).\n- For input 34, 64 / 34 = 1.882 (approximately).\n\nThe ratios are not consistent, but they are all greater than 1.7 and less than 2.0. This suggests that the output is roughly double the input, with some variation.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the new input:\n\n- **Input: [26]**\n\nTo find the output, we can estimate it by multiplying the input by a factor between 1.7 and 2.0. Let's try using an average factor of around 1.8 for simplicity:\n\n- Estimated output = 26 * 1.8 = 46.8\n\nSince the output should be an integer, we can round this to the nearest whole number:\n\n- Rounded output = 47\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [26] is likely to be 47.\n\nFinal answer: <<<47>>>"
