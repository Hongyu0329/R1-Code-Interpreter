    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [89, 96, 65, 15, 78, 75, 32, 56, 61, 34]\n   - Output: [90, 96, 65, 15, 78, 75, 32, 56, 61, 35]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [57, 71, 47, 22, 71, 84, 100, 100]\n   - Output: [58, 71, 47, 22, 71, 84, 100, 101]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [6, 70, 94, 62]\n   - Output: [7, 70, 94, 63]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [44, 8, 12, 78]\n   - Output: [45, 8, 12, 79]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the rule:\n- Increment the first element of the list by 1.\n- Increment the last element of the list by 1.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [25, 100, 25, 1, 68]\n- Increment the first element (25) by 1 to get 26.\n- Increment the last element (68) by 1 to get 69.\n- The other elements (100, 25, 1) remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the output list is: [26, 100, 25, 1, 69]\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<[26, 100, 25, 1, 69]>>>"
