    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - In each example, the output list is a sorted version of the input list in ascending order.\n\n2. **Apply the Pattern to the New Input:**\n   - Given the input list: [92, 68, 87, 100]\n   - Sort the list in ascending order: [68, 87, 92, 100]\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - The sorted list is the final output.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[68, 87, 92, 100]>>>"
