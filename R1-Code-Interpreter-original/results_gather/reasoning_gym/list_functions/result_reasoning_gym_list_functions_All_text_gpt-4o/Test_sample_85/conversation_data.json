    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [52]\n   - Output: [100]\n   - Analysis: The output is 100. If we look at the difference between the output and the input, we have 100 - 52 = 48.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [73]\n   - Output: [142]\n   - Analysis: The output is 142. The difference between the output and the input is 142 - 73 = 69.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [21]\n   - Output: [38]\n   - Analysis: The output is 38. The difference between the output and the input is 38 - 21 = 17.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [91]\n   - Output: [178]\n   - Analysis: The output is 178. The difference between the output and the input is 178 - 91 = 87.\n\nNow, let's try to identify a pattern in these differences:\n- For Input 1: 48\n- For Input 2: 69\n- For Input 3: 17\n- For Input 4: 87\n\nThe differences do not follow a simple arithmetic pattern, so let's consider another approach. Let's examine the relationship between the input and output more closely:\n\n- For Input 1: 52 * 2 - 4 = 100\n- For Input 2: 73 * 2 - 4 = 142\n- For Input 3: 21 * 2 - 4 = 38\n- For Input 4: 91 * 2 - 4 = 178\n\nThe pattern appears to be: multiply the input by 2 and then subtract 4 to get the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- Input: [11]\n- Calculation: 11 * 2 - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [11] is 18.\n\nFinal answer: <<<[18]>>>"
