    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [26, 20, 95, 39]\n   - Output: [39, 95, 20, 26]\n   - Analysis: The output is a rearrangement of the input. The numbers are sorted in descending order.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [96, 24, 39, 12]\n   - Output: [12, 39, 24, 96]\n   - Analysis: The output is a rearrangement of the input. The numbers are sorted in ascending order.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [93, 85, 61, 70, 50, 50, 65, 52]\n   - Output: [52, 65, 50, 50, 70, 61, 85, 93]\n   - Analysis: The output is a rearrangement of the input. The numbers are sorted in ascending order.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [93, 55, 69, 99, 81, 6, 81, 33]\n   - Output: [33, 81, 6, 81, 99, 69, 55, 93]\n   - Analysis: The output is a rearrangement of the input. The numbers are sorted in ascending order.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can deduce that the rule is to sort the input list in ascending order to produce the output list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [30, 66, 91]\n- **Step 1:** Sort the numbers in ascending order: [30, 66, 91]\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[30, 66, 91]>>>"
