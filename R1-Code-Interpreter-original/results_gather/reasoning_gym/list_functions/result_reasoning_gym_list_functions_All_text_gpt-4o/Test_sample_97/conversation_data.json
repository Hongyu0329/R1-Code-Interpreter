    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [6]\n   - Output: [8]\n   - Analysis: The output is 2 more than the input.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [87]\n   - Output: [170]\n   - Analysis: The output is 83 more than the input.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [77]\n   - Output: [150]\n   - Analysis: The output is 73 more than the input.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [13]\n   - Output: [22]\n   - Analysis: The output is 9 more than the input.\n\nNow, let's try to find a consistent pattern or rule:\n\n- The differences between the input and output are: 2, 83, 73, and 9.\n- These differences do not follow a simple arithmetic pattern, so let's consider another approach.\n\nLet's examine the outputs in relation to the inputs:\n\n- For Input 6, Output 8: The output is 2 more than the input.\n- For Input 87, Output 170: The output is 83 more than the input.\n- For Input 77, Output 150: The output is 73 more than the input.\n- For Input 13, Output 22: The output is 9 more than the input.\n\nThe differences between the input and output seem to be related to the input number itself. Let's consider the possibility of doubling the input and then adding a certain number:\n\n- For Input 6: 6 * 2 = 12, but the output is 8, which is 4 less than 12.\n- For Input 87: 87 * 2 = 174, but the output is 170, which is 4 less than 174.\n- For Input 77: 77 * 2 = 154, but the output is 150, which is 4 less than 154.\n- For Input 13: 13 * 2 = 26, but the output is 22, which is 4 less than 26.\n\nThe pattern appears to be: Double the input and then subtract 4.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- Input: [80]\n- Calculation: 80 * 2 = 160\n- Subtract 4: 160 - 4 = 156\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [80] is [156].\n\nFinal answer: <<<156>>>"
