    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [66, 75, 5, 59, 6, 86, 61, 5, 87, 5, 94, 5, 99, 5, 56, 5]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - Observation: The number 5 appears multiple times in the input list. The number 6 appears once and is the output. It seems like the output is the number that appears once in the list, which is not 5.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [88, 17, 26, 70, 60, 74, 19, 26, 87]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: There is no number that appears exactly once in the list. The output is 0, which might indicate that if no number appears exactly once, the output is 0.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [42, 35, 5, 25, 8]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: All numbers appear once. The output is 1, which might indicate that if all numbers appear once, the output is 1.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [15, 38, 60, 67, 73, 87, 38, 84]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 38 appears twice, and no other number appears exactly once. The output is 0.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the following rules:\n- If there is a number that appears exactly once in the list, that number is the output.\n- If no number appears exactly once, the output is 0.\n- If all numbers appear once, the output is 1.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [5, 38, 5, 5, 68, 71, 71, 3, 100, 5, 21, 57]\n- Count the occurrences of each number:\n  - 5 appears 4 times\n  - 38 appears 1 time\n  - 68 appears 1 time\n  - 71 appears 2 times\n  - 3 appears 1 time\n  - 100 appears 1 time\n  - 21 appears 1 time\n  - 57 appears 1 time\n\n- Numbers that appear exactly once: 38, 68, 3, 100, 21, 57\n\nSince there are multiple numbers that appear exactly once, we need to determine which one to output. Based on the examples, it seems that if there are multiple numbers that appear exactly once, we output the first one that appears in the list.\n\n- The first number that appears exactly once in the list is 38.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[38]>>>"
