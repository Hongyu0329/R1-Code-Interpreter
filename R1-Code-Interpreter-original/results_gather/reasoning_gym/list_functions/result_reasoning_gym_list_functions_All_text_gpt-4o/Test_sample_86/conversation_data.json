    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. **Example 1: [13, 38, 40, 47, 90] -> [1]**\n   - The numbers are a mix of even and odd.\n   - The output is [1].\n\n2. **Example 2: [43, 39, 4] -> [0]**\n   - The numbers are a mix of even and odd.\n   - The output is [0].\n\n3. **Example 3: [19, 44, 66, 66, 67, 73, 75, 78, 88, 93] -> [1]**\n   - The numbers are a mix of even and odd.\n   - The output is [1].\n\n4. **Example 4: [73, 27, 17] -> [0]**\n   - All numbers are odd.\n   - The output is [0].\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the following pattern:\n- If the list contains at least one even number, the output is [1].\n- If the list contains only odd numbers, the output is [0].\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n**Input: [8, 9, 37, 43, 47, 72, 80, 83, 97]**\n\n- The list contains both even (8, 72, 80) and odd numbers.\n- Since there are even numbers present, according to the pattern, the output should be [1].\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
