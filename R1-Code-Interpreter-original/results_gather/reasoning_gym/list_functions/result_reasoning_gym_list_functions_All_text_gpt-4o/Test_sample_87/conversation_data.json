    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [24, 95, 69, 86, 97, 71, 97]\n   - Output: [69]\n   - Observation: The number 69 is the only number in the output. It is the only number in the input that is divisible by 3.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [14, 11, 55, 81, 32, 23, 33, 36, 27]\n   - Output: [81, 33]\n   - Observation: The numbers 81 and 33 are divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [75, 3, 52, 91, 33, 56, 96, 94, 8, 87]\n   - Output: [3, 33, 56, 96, 94]\n   - Observation: The numbers 3, 33, 56, 96, and 94 are divisible by 3.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [27, 17, 60, 2, 67, 67, 93, 64]\n   - Output: [17, 60, 93]\n   - Observation: The numbers 17, 60, and 93 are divisible by 3.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule involves selecting numbers from the input list that are divisible by 3.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [14, 6, 31, 28, 62, 49, 61, 69, 78]\n- Check each number for divisibility by 3:\n  - 14: Not divisible by 3\n  - 6: Divisible by 3\n  - 31: Not divisible by 3\n  - 28: Not divisible by 3\n  - 62: Not divisible by 3\n  - 49: Not divisible by 3\n  - 61: Not divisible by 3\n  - 69: Divisible by 3\n  - 78: Divisible by 3\n\nThe numbers that are divisible by 3 are 6, 69, and 78.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[6, 69, 78]>>>"
