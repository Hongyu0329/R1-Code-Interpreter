    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [34, 50, 4, 25, 29, 51]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of elements in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [83, 33, 87]\n   - Output: [3]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of elements in the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [91, 23, 4, 38, 87, 10, 47, 2]\n   - Output: [8]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of elements in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [55, 45, 55, 97]\n   - Output: [4]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of elements in the input list.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule is to count the number of elements in the input list and output that count as a single-element list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [51, 66, 75, 39]\n- Count the number of elements: There are 4 elements in the list.\n\nTherefore, the output should be a list containing the number 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
