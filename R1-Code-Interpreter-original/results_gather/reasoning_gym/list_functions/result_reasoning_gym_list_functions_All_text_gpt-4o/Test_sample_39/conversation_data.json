    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [2, 20, 26, 34, 34, 66, 80, 97]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The list is in ascending order, and the output is [1].\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [77, 66, 26, 8]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The list is in descending order, and the output is [0].\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [4, 47, 59, 65, 68, 89]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The list is in ascending order, and the output is [1].\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [83, 45, 45, 22, 5]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The list is in descending order, and the output is [0].\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the rule:\n- If the list is in ascending order, the output is [1].\n- If the list is in descending order, the output is [0].\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input: [50, 75, 83]**\n  - The list is in ascending order.\n\nAccording to the rule, if the list is in ascending order, the output should be [1].\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [50, 75, 83] is:\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
