    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [26, 94, 99]\n   - Output: [27, 94, 100]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements are incremented by 1, while the middle element remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [51, 43, 1, 92, 17, 3]\n   - Output: [52, 43, 1, 92, 17, 4]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements are incremented by 1, while the other elements remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [14, 19, 16, 10, 84]\n   - Output: [15, 19, 16, 10, 85]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements are incremented by 1, while the other elements remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [48, 83, 8, 26, 75, 33, 51, 42]\n   - Output: [49, 83, 8, 26, 75, 33, 51, 43]\n   - Analysis: The first and last elements are incremented by 1, while the other elements remain unchanged.\n\n**Identified Rule:**\n- The first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the New Input:**\n- Input: [81, 39, 53, 6, 60]\n- First element (81) is incremented by 1 to become 82.\n- Last element (60) is incremented by 1 to become 61.\n- The other elements (39, 53, 6) remain unchanged.\n\n**Final Output:**\n- Output: [82, 39, 53, 6, 61]\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[82, 39, 53, 6, 61]>>>"
