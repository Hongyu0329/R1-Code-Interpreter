    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps each input list to its corresponding output list. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [74, 77, 59]\n   - Output: [74, 78, 61]\n   - Analysis: \n     - The first element remains the same: 74 → 74.\n     - The second element increases by 1: 77 → 78.\n     - The third element increases by 2: 59 → 61.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [83, 23, 61, 61, 30, 21]\n   - Output: [83, 24, 63, 64, 34, 26]\n   - Analysis:\n     - The first element remains the same: 83 → 83.\n     - The second element increases by 1: 23 → 24.\n     - The third element increases by 2: 61 → 63.\n     - The fourth element increases by 3: 61 → 64.\n     - The fifth element increases by 4: 30 → 34.\n     - The sixth element increases by 5: 21 → 26.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [81, 63, 12, 95, 87]\n   - Output: [81, 64, 14, 98, 91]\n   - Analysis:\n     - The first element remains the same: 81 → 81.\n     - The second element increases by 1: 63 → 64.\n     - The third element increases by 2: 12 → 14.\n     - The fourth element increases by 3: 95 → 98.\n     - The fifth element increases by 4: 87 → 91.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [69, 19, 46, 26, 98, 64, 50]\n   - Output: [69, 20, 48, 29, 102, 69, 56]\n   - Analysis:\n     - The first element remains the same: 69 → 69.\n     - The second element increases by 1: 19 → 20.\n     - The third element increases by 2: 46 → 48.\n     - The fourth element increases by 3: 26 → 29.\n     - The fifth element increases by 4: 98 → 102.\n     - The sixth element increases by 5: 64 → 69.\n     - The seventh element increases by 6: 50 → 56.\n\n**Identified Pattern:**\n- The first element of the list remains unchanged.\n- Each subsequent element increases by an incrementing integer starting from 1. Specifically, the second element increases by 1, the third by 2, the fourth by 3, and so on.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the New Input:**\n- Input: [54, 53, 36]\n  - The first element remains the same: 54 → 54.\n  - The second element increases by 1: 53 → 54.\n  - The third element increases by 2: 36 → 38.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [54, 53, 36] is:\n\n<<<[54, 54, 38]>>>"
