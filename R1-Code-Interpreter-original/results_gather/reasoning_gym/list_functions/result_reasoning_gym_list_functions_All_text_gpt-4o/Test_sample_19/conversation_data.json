    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [835]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Analysis: The number 835 results in an output of 0.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [320]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Analysis: The number 320 results in an output of 1.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [2165]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Analysis: The number 2165 results in an output of 0.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [650]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Analysis: The number 650 results in an output of 1.\n\n**Identifying the Pattern:**\n- We need to determine what characteristic of the input numbers results in an output of either 0 or 1.\n- Let's consider the divisibility of the numbers by 5:\n  - 835 is divisible by 5 (835 ÷ 5 = 167), and the output is 0.\n  - 320 is divisible by 5 (320 ÷ 5 = 64), and the output is 1.\n  - 2165 is divisible by 5 (2165 ÷ 5 = 433), and the output is 0.\n  - 650 is divisible by 5 (650 ÷ 5 = 130), and the output is 1.\n\n- It seems that all numbers are divisible by 5, so divisibility by 5 alone does not determine the output.\n- Let's consider the divisibility by 10:\n  - 835 is not divisible by 10, and the output is 0.\n  - 320 is divisible by 10, and the output is 1.\n  - 2165 is not divisible by 10, and the output is 0.\n  - 650 is divisible by 10, and the output is 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The output is 1 if the number is divisible by 10, and 0 if it is not.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Input:**\n- Input: [1715]\n- Check divisibility by 10: 1715 is not divisible by 10 (1715 ÷ 10 = 171.5).\n\nTherefore, based on the identified pattern, the output for the input [1715] is 0.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0>>>"
