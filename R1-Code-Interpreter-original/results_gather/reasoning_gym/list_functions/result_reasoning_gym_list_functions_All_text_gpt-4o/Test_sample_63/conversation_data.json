    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 64\n   - Output: 124\n   - Difference: 124 - 64 = 60\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 78\n   - Output: 152\n   - Difference: 152 - 78 = 74\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 96\n   - Output: 188\n   - Difference: 188 - 96 = 92\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: 24\n   - Output: 44\n   - Difference: 44 - 24 = 20\n\nFrom these examples, we observe that the output is obtained by adding a certain value to the input. The differences between the output and input are 60, 74, 92, and 20, respectively.\n\nNext, let's examine if there's a consistent pattern or rule for these differences:\n\n- The differences (60, 74, 92, 20) do not form a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence.\n- However, if we look at the differences in relation to the inputs:\n  - For 64, the difference is 60, which is close to 64 * 0.9375.\n  - For 78, the difference is 74, which is close to 78 * 0.9487.\n  - For 96, the difference is 92, which is close to 96 * 0.9583.\n  - For 24, the difference is 20, which is close to 24 * 0.8333.\n\nThe differences seem to be approximately proportional to the inputs, but not exactly. Let's try to find a simpler pattern:\n\n- If we consider the output as approximately double the input minus a small constant, we can check:\n  - For 64, 2 * 64 - 4 = 124\n  - For 78, 2 * 78 - 4 = 152\n  - For 96, 2 * 96 - 4 = 188\n  - For 24, 2 * 24 - 4 = 44\n\nThis pattern holds for all examples: the output is approximately double the input minus 4.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input: 15**\n  - Calculate: 2 * 15 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [15] is:\n\n<<<26>>>"
