    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input to the output based on the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [635]\n   - Output: [0]\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [910]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [1125]\n   - Output: [0]\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [620]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Observe the inputs and outputs.\n  - Inputs are three-digit numbers.\n  - Outputs are either 0 or 1.\n\n- **Step 2:** Look for patterns in the numbers.\n  - Check if the numbers have any common properties or if they can be grouped based on certain criteria.\n\n- **Step 3:** Analyze the digits of the numbers.\n  - Consider the sum of the digits, the difference between digits, or any other arithmetic operation.\n\n- **Step 4:** Check for divisibility or other mathematical properties.\n  - Consider if the numbers are divisible by a certain number or if they have a specific remainder when divided by a number.\n\n- **Step 5:** Compare the examples to find a consistent rule.\n  - Example 1: 635 -> 0\n  - Example 2: 910 -> 1\n  - Example 3: 1125 -> 0\n  - Example 4: 620 -> 1\n\n- **Step 6:** Hypothesize a rule.\n  - One possible rule could be based on the divisibility of the number by a certain value.\n  - Check if the numbers that output 1 are divisible by a specific number, and those that output 0 are not, or vice versa.\n\n- **Step 7:** Test the hypothesis with the given input.\n  - Input: [1475]\n\n- **Step 8:** Apply the rule to the new input.\n  - Check if 1475 follows the same pattern as the examples that output 0 or 1.\n\n- **Step 9:** Determine the output based on the rule.\n  - If 1475 follows the pattern of numbers that output 0, then the output is 0.\n  - If 1475 follows the pattern of numbers that output 1, then the output is 1.\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, it appears that the rule involves checking the divisibility of the number by 5. Numbers that are divisible by 5 output 1, and those that are not output 0.\n\n- 635 is divisible by 5, output is 0.\n- 910 is divisible by 5, output is 1.\n- 1125 is divisible by 5, output is 0.\n- 620 is divisible by 5, output is 1.\n\nFor the input 1475:\n- 1475 is divisible by 5.\n\nTherefore, based on the pattern, the output for the input [1475] is 0.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0>>>"
