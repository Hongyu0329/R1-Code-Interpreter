    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 46\n   - Output: 88\n   - Observation: The output is 88, which is 46 multiplied by 2 minus 4 (i.e., 46 * 2 - 4 = 92 - 4 = 88).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 16\n   - Output: 28\n   - Observation: The output is 28, which is 16 multiplied by 2 minus 4 (i.e., 16 * 2 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 10\n   - Output: 16\n   - Observation: The output is 16, which is 10 multiplied by 2 minus 4 (i.e., 10 * 2 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16).\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: 76\n   - Output: 148\n   - Observation: The output is 148, which is 76 multiplied by 2 minus 4 (i.e., 76 * 2 - 4 = 152 - 4 = 148).\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the rule:\n- For any given input \\( x \\), the output is calculated as \\( (x \\times 2) - 4 \\).\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input: 22**\n  - Calculate the output using the rule: \\( (22 \\times 2) - 4 = 44 - 4 = 40 \\).\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [22] is:\n\n<<<[40]>>>"
