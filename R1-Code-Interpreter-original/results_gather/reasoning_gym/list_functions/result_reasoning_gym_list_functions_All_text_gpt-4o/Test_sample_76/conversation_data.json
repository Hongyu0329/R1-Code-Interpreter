    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - In each example, the output list is a sorted version of the input list in ascending order.\n   - This means that the rule applied to the input list is to sort the elements in increasing order.\n\n2. **Apply the Rule to the Given Input:**\n   - Given Input: [5, 45, 93, 43, 84, 31, 26, 66, 98, 63]\n   - Sort the list in ascending order: [5, 26, 31, 43, 45, 63, 66, 84, 93, 98]\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - The sorted list is the final output.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[5, 26, 31, 43, 45, 63, 66, 84, 93, 98]>>>"
