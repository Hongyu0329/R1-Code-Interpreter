    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps each input list to its corresponding output list. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [67, 70, 90, 15, 23, 49, 29, 38, 4]\n   - Output: [67, 71, 92, 18, 27, 54, 35, 45, 12]\n   - Analysis: \n     - 67 -> 67 (no change)\n     - 70 -> 71 (+1)\n     - 90 -> 92 (+2)\n     - 15 -> 18 (+3)\n     - 23 -> 27 (+4)\n     - 49 -> 54 (+5)\n     - 29 -> 35 (+6)\n     - 38 -> 45 (+7)\n     - 4 -> 12 (+8)\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [15, 73, 2, 13, 21, 100]\n   - Output: [15, 74, 4, 16, 25, 105]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 15 -> 15 (no change)\n     - 73 -> 74 (+1)\n     - 2 -> 4 (+2)\n     - 13 -> 16 (+3)\n     - 21 -> 25 (+4)\n     - 100 -> 105 (+5)\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [89, 82, 49, 76, 52, 99, 89]\n   - Output: [89, 83, 51, 79, 56, 104, 95]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 89 -> 89 (no change)\n     - 82 -> 83 (+1)\n     - 49 -> 51 (+2)\n     - 76 -> 79 (+3)\n     - 52 -> 56 (+4)\n     - 99 -> 104 (+5)\n     - 89 -> 95 (+6)\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [46, 10, 44, 37, 80, 21, 15, 66]\n   - Output: [46, 11, 46, 40, 84, 26, 21, 73]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 46 -> 46 (no change)\n     - 10 -> 11 (+1)\n     - 44 -> 46 (+2)\n     - 37 -> 40 (+3)\n     - 80 -> 84 (+4)\n     - 21 -> 26 (+5)\n     - 15 -> 21 (+6)\n     - 66 -> 73 (+7)\n\n**Identified Pattern:**\n- The first element remains unchanged.\n- For each subsequent element, add an incrementing integer starting from 1.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the New Input:**\n- Input: [76, 13, 35, 41]\n- Output:\n  - 76 -> 76 (no change)\n  - 13 -> 14 (+1)\n  - 35 -> 37 (+2)\n  - 41 -> 44 (+3)\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [76, 13, 35, 41] is:\n\n<<<[76, 14, 37, 44]>>>"
