    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [80, 75, 73]\n   - Output: [73]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [4, 4, 35, 26]\n   - Output: [35]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [30, 39, 87, 86, 40, 49, 8, 41, 38]\n   - Output: [87]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [49, 14, 12, 95]\n   - Output: [12]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the input list.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule alternates between selecting the smallest and the largest number from the input list. Specifically:\n- For odd-numbered examples (1 and 3), the output is the smallest number.\n- For even-numbered examples (2 and 4), the output is the largest number.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [45, 3, 61, 23, 94, 78, 92, 48]\n- This is the 5th example (odd-numbered), so we select the smallest number from the list.\n\nThe smallest number in the list [45, 3, 61, 23, 94, 78, 92, 48] is 3.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
