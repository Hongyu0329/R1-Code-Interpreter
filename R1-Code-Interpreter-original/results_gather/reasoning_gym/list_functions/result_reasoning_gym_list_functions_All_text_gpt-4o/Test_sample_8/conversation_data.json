    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [3755]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 3755 ends with the digit 5.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [590]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The number 590 ends with the digit 0.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [2675]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 2675 ends with the digit 5.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [750]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The number 750 ends with the digit 0.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce a pattern:\n- If the number ends with the digit 0, the output is [1].\n- If the number ends with the digit 5, the output is [0].\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input: [295]**\n  - The number 295 ends with the digit 5.\n\nAccording to the pattern we identified, if a number ends with the digit 5, the output should be [0].\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [295] is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
