    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [75, 14, 1, 40, 68, 99, 74, 43]\n   - Output: [15]\n   - Observation: The output is 15, which is the smallest number in the input list plus 1 (14 + 1 = 15).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [21, 45, 22, 97, 19, 13, 85]\n   - Output: [75]\n   - Observation: The output is 75, which is the smallest number in the input list plus 62 (13 + 62 = 75).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [45, 22, 56, 79, 50, 59, 64, 87, 30]\n   - Output: [22]\n   - Observation: The output is 22, which is the smallest number in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [79, 40, 68, 33, 8]\n   - Output: [8]\n   - Observation: The output is 8, which is the smallest number in the input list.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce that the rule involves selecting the smallest number from the input list. In some cases, the output is the smallest number itself, while in other cases, it is the smallest number plus a certain value.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the given input:\n\n- **Input: [80, 15, 46, 93, 98, 87, 24, 95]**\n  - The smallest number in the list is 15.\n  - Based on the examples, the output should be the smallest number itself.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[15]>>>"
