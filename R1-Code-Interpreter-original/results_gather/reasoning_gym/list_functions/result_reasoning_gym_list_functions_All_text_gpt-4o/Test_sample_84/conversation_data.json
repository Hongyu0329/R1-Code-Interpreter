    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - In each example, the output list is a sorted version of the input list in ascending order.\n   - This means that the rule applied to the input list is to sort the elements in increasing order.\n\n2. **Apply the Rule to the New Input:**\n   - Given the input list: [70, 34, 91, 48, 52, 6, 55, 81, 1]\n   - We need to sort this list in ascending order.\n\n3. **Sorting the List:**\n   - Start with the smallest number and arrange the numbers in increasing order.\n   - The sorted list is: [1, 6, 34, 48, 52, 55, 70, 81, 91]\n\n4. **Final Output:**\n   - The final output is the sorted list.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n<<<[1, 6, 34, 48, 52, 55, 70, 81, 91]>>>"
