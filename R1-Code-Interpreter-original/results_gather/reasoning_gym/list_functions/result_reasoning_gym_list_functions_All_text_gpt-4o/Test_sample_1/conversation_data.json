    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [81, 30, 36, 62, 84]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The output is [0], which suggests that there might be a specific condition that leads to this output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [84, 79, 65, 42, 88]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: Again, the output is [0]. This suggests that the condition for outputting [0] is met in this list as well.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [57, 37, 87, 82, 10, 39, 53, 40, 67, 64]\n   - Output: [10]\n   - Observation: The output is [10], which is an element from the input list. This suggests that there might be a specific condition that selects an element from the list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [96, 78, 95]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The output is [0], similar to examples 1 and 2.\n\nFrom these observations, we can hypothesize that:\n- The output is [0] if no specific condition is met in the list.\n- The output is a specific element from the list if a certain condition is met.\n\nNow, let's try to identify the condition:\n- In Example 3, the number 10 is the smallest number in the list. This might be the condition that leads to selecting an element from the list.\n- In Examples 1, 2, and 4, the output is [0], which might indicate that there is no number in the list that meets the condition of being the smallest.\n\nApplying this hypothesis to the new input:\n- Input: [36, 41, 72, 98, 88, 32, 16, 8, 41]\n- The smallest number in this list is 8.\n\nTherefore, based on the pattern observed, the output should be the smallest number in the list.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[8]>>>"
