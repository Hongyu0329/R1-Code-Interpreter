    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - In each example, the output list is a sorted version of the input list in ascending order.\n   - The sorting is done numerically, from the smallest to the largest number.\n\n2. **Apply the Pattern to the New Input:**\n   - Given the input list: [36, 37, 47, 47, 65, 14]\n   - Sort the list in ascending order.\n\n3. **Sorting the List:**\n   - Start with the smallest number and arrange the numbers in increasing order.\n   - The sorted order of the list [36, 37, 47, 47, 65, 14] is [14, 36, 37, 47, 47, 65].\n\n4. **Final Output:**\n   - The final output is the sorted list.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is: <<<[14, 36, 37, 47, 47, 65]>>>"
