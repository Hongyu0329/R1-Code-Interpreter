    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [17, 72, 92, 69, 39, 65, 25, 92]\n   - Output: [17, 72, 92, 69, 39, 65, 25, 92]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [22, 20, 85, 14, 64, 84, 29, 28, 98]\n   - Output: [22, 20, 85, 14, 64, 84, 29, 28, 98]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [61, 28, 4, 10, 55]\n   - Output: [61, 28, 4, 10, 55]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [17, 64, 87, 21]\n   - Output: [17, 64, 87, 21]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce that the rule is to output the input list as it is, without any modifications. The output is simply a direct copy of the input list.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [8, 90, 71, 38, 44]\n- **Output:** The output should be identical to the input.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 90, 71, 38, 44]>>>"
