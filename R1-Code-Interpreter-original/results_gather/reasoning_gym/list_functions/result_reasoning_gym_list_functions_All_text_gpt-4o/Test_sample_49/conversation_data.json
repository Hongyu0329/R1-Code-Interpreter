    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [3, 20, 21, 44, 50, 58, 62, 69, 72, 87]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The list is a mix of numbers, and the output is [1]. There is no immediately obvious pattern in the numbers themselves.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [93, 41, 37]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The list contains three numbers, and the output is [0]. Again, no clear pattern in the numbers.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [10, 17, 28, 29, 40, 66, 78, 88]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The list contains eight numbers, and the output is [1].\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [100, 92, 75, 72, 43, 24, 24]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The list contains seven numbers, and the output is [0].\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The output seems to be related to the number of elements in the input list.\n- If the number of elements in the list is even, the output is [1].\n- If the number of elements in the list is odd, the output is [0].\n\n**Verification:**\n- Example 1 has 10 elements (even), output is [1].\n- Example 2 has 3 elements (odd), output is [0].\n- Example 3 has 8 elements (even), output is [1].\n- Example 4 has 7 elements (odd), output is [0].\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe rule is based on the parity of the number of elements in the input list:\n- Even number of elements -> Output [1]\n- Odd number of elements -> Output [0]\n\n**Applying the rule to the given input:**\n- Input: [3, 30, 32, 58, 58, 72, 84, 90, 99]\n- The input list has 9 elements, which is odd.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
