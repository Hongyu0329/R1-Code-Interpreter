    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output list in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [41, 16, 40, 24]\n   - Output: [41, 16, 40]\n   - Analysis: The output includes numbers that are either prime or have a specific property related to their position or value.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [45, 16, 57, 59, 68, 36]\n   - Output: [45, 59, 68]\n   - Analysis: The output includes numbers that are either prime or have a specific property related to their position or value.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [22, 41, 36, 65, 80, 1, 89, 66, 6, 17]\n   - Output: [41, 65, 89, 66]\n   - Analysis: The output includes numbers that are either prime or have a specific property related to their position or value.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [57, 20, 77, 54, 31, 35]\n   - Output: [57, 77]\n   - Analysis: The output includes numbers that are either prime or have a specific property related to their position or value.\n\nFrom the analysis, it seems that the output list is formed by selecting numbers from the input list that are either prime or have a specific property related to their position or value. However, the exact rule is not clear from the examples alone.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the given input:\n\n- **Input: [85, 56, 1, 71, 26, 85, 21]**\n\nTo determine the output, we need to identify numbers that fit the pattern observed in the examples. Let's check each number:\n\n- 85: Not prime, but it appears twice in the list.\n- 56: Not prime.\n- 1: Not prime.\n- 71: Prime.\n- 26: Not prime.\n- 85: Not prime, but it appears twice in the list.\n- 21: Not prime.\n\nBased on the pattern observed, we select numbers that are either prime or have a specific property related to their position or value. In this case, 71 is prime, and 85 appears twice in the list.\n\nTherefore, the output list should be:\n\n<<<[71, 85]>>>"
