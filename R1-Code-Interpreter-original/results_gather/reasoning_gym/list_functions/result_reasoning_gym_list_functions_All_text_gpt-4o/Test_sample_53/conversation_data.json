    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [90, 79, 14, 42, 25, 29]\n   - Output: [14]\n   - Observation: 14 is the smallest number in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [100, 99, 45, 75, 29, 88, 49, 69, 69, 29]\n   - Output: [45]\n   - Observation: 45 is the smallest number in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [78, 56, 16, 1, 88, 72, 10, 56, 61, 80]\n   - Output: [16]\n   - Observation: 16 is the smallest number in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [100, 62, 88, 29, 83, 29, 17, 54, 89, 15]\n   - Output: [88]\n   - Observation: 88 is the smallest number in the list.\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the rule is to select the smallest number from the input list. However, in Example 4, 88 is not the smallest number, which suggests that the rule might be more complex.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples with a different perspective:\n\n- In each example, the output is not necessarily the smallest number, but rather a number that is unique in some way compared to the others. It seems that the output is the smallest number that is not repeated in the list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input:** [21, 2, 49, 73, 19, 65, 87, 71]\n- Find the smallest number that is not repeated:\n  - 2 is the smallest number and it is not repeated.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input should be:\n\n<<<[2]>>>"
