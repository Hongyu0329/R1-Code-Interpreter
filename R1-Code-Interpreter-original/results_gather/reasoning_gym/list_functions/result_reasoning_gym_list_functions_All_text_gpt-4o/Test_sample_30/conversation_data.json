    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [9, 31, 60, 40, 86]\n   - Output: [9, 32, 62, 43, 90]\n   - Analysis: \n     - 9 remains 9 (no change).\n     - 31 becomes 32 (+1).\n     - 60 becomes 62 (+2).\n     - 40 becomes 43 (+3).\n     - 86 becomes 90 (+4).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [22, 66, 24, 21, 1, 34, 82, 22]\n   - Output: [22, 67, 26, 24, 5, 39, 88, 29]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 22 remains 22 (no change).\n     - 66 becomes 67 (+1).\n     - 24 becomes 26 (+2).\n     - 21 becomes 24 (+3).\n     - 1 becomes 5 (+4).\n     - 34 becomes 39 (+5).\n     - 82 becomes 88 (+6).\n     - 22 becomes 29 (+7).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [4, 61, 61, 67]\n   - Output: [4, 62, 63, 70]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 4 remains 4 (no change).\n     - 61 becomes 62 (+1).\n     - 61 becomes 63 (+2).\n     - 67 becomes 70 (+3).\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [100, 44, 76]\n   - Output: [100, 45, 78]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 100 remains 100 (no change).\n     - 44 becomes 45 (+1).\n     - 76 becomes 78 (+2).\n\n**Pattern Identification:**\n- The first element in each list remains unchanged.\n- Starting from the second element, each subsequent element is increased by an incrementing integer starting from 1. The increment increases by 1 for each subsequent element.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the New Input:**\n- Input: [89, 28, 92, 11, 42]\n- Output:\n  - 89 remains 89 (no change).\n  - 28 becomes 29 (+1).\n  - 92 becomes 94 (+2).\n  - 11 becomes 14 (+3).\n  - 42 becomes 46 (+4).\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[89, 29, 94, 14, 46]>>>"
