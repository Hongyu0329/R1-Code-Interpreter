    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [71, 1, 23, 8, 54, 36, 47]\n   - Output: [23, 8, 54]\n   - Observation: The output consists of numbers from the input that are between 1 and 71, and they are the smallest numbers in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [41, 22, 51]\n   - Output: [41]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [54, 3, 70, 61, 79, 55, 3]\n   - Output: [3]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [28, 13, 52, 41, 27, 19]\n   - Output: [13]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule is to select the smallest number from the input list. \n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [25, 99, 84, 46, 69, 38, 97, 52, 22]\n- The smallest number in this list is 22.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input should be:\n\n<<<[22]>>>"
