    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [11, 84, 59, 3, 18, 39]\n   - Output: [11, 84, 59, 3, 18, 39]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [88, 80, 2]\n   - Output: [88, 80, 2]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [49, 63, 69, 39, 98, 21, 94, 75, 44, 86]\n   - Output: [49, 63, 69, 39, 98, 21, 94, 75, 44, 86]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [68, 15, 13, 48, 83]\n   - Output: [68, 15, 13, 48, 83]\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce that the rule is to output the list exactly as it is given in the input. There is no transformation or filtering applied to the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input:** [41, 40, 12]\n- According to the identified rule, the output should be identical to the input.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[41, 40, 12]>>>"
