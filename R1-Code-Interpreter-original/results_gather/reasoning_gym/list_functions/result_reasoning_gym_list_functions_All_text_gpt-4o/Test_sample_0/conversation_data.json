    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [28, 19, 39, 90]\n   - Output: [39]\n   - Observation: 39 is the third element in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [64, 4, 93, 5, 13, 42]\n   - Output: [93]\n   - Observation: 93 is the third element in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [8, 67, 89, 61, 48, 77, 1, 70]\n   - Output: [89]\n   - Observation: 89 is the third element in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [68, 2, 63, 94, 99]\n   - Output: [63]\n   - Observation: 63 is the third element in the list.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule is to select the third element from the input list as the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [37, 26, 58, 11, 43, 16]\n- The third element in this list is 58.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[58]>>>"
