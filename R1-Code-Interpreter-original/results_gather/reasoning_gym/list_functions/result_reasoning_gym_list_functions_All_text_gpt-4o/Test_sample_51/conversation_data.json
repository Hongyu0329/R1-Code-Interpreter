    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [59, 12, 17, 49, 5, 7, 84, 28, 25, 23]\n   - Output: [84, 59, 49, 28, 25, 23, 17, 12, 7, 5]\n   - Analysis: The output is the input list sorted in descending order.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [11, 7, 53, 20, 46, 39, 72]\n   - Output: [72, 53, 46, 39, 20, 11, 7]\n   - Analysis: The output is the input list sorted in descending order.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [61, 81, 91, 30, 58, 22]\n   - Output: [91, 81, 61, 58, 30, 22]\n   - Analysis: The output is the input list sorted in descending order.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [4, 3, 97]\n   - Output: [97, 4, 3]\n   - Analysis: The output is the input list sorted in descending order.\n\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can deduce that the rule is to sort the input list in descending order to get the output list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [45, 50, 74, 93, 24, 71, 41, 62, 59, 77]\n- **Step 1:** Sort the list in descending order.\n\nThe sorted list in descending order is: [93, 77, 74, 71, 62, 59, 50, 45, 41, 24]\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[93, 77, 74, 71, 62, 59, 50, 45, 41, 24]>>>"
