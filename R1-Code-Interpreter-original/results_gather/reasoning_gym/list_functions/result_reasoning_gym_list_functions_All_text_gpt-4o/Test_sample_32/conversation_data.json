    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [16, 81, 79, 52, 69, 88, 3, 27, 35, 91]\n   - Output: [79, 69]\n   - Observation: The output contains numbers that are prime.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [90, 100, 84, 19, 11, 54]\n   - Output: [90, 100, 11]\n   - Observation: The output contains numbers that are either prime or perfect squares.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [26, 93, 4, 11, 52, 87, 1, 9, 23, 14]\n   - Output: [93, 11, 23]\n   - Observation: The output contains numbers that are either prime or perfect squares.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [76, 34, 29]\n   - Output: [76]\n   - Observation: The output contains numbers that are either prime or perfect squares.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule involves selecting numbers that are either prime or perfect squares.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [12, 4, 99, 59, 51, 28]\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n- 12: Not a prime, not a perfect square.\n- 4: Perfect square (2^2).\n- 99: Not a prime, not a perfect square.\n- 59: Prime number.\n- 51: Not a prime, not a perfect square.\n- 28: Not a prime, not a perfect square.\n\nBased on the rule, the numbers that are either prime or perfect squares are 4 and 59.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[4, 59]>>>"
