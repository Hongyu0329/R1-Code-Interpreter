    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [27, 95, 83, 26, 6, 25]\n   - Output: [25, 6, 26, 83, 95, 27]\n   - Analysis: The output seems to be a rearrangement of the input. The smallest number (6) is moved towards the beginning, and the largest number (95) is moved towards the end. The numbers appear to be sorted in a specific order.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [52, 46, 37, 34, 58, 79, 54, 37, 75, 14]\n   - Output: [14, 75, 37, 54, 79, 58, 34, 37, 46, 52]\n   - Analysis: The smallest number (14) is moved to the start, and the largest number (79) is moved towards the end. The numbers are rearranged in a specific order.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [63, 28, 61]\n   - Output: [61, 28, 63]\n   - Analysis: The smallest number (28) is in the middle, and the largest number (63) is at the end. The numbers are rearranged in a specific order.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [58, 71, 85, 49]\n   - Output: [49, 85, 71, 58]\n   - Analysis: The smallest number (49) is moved to the start, and the largest number (85) is moved towards the end. The numbers are rearranged in a specific order.\n\n**Pattern Identification:**\n- The output list is a rearrangement of the input list.\n- The smallest number is moved towards the start of the list.\n- The largest number is moved towards the end of the list.\n- The numbers in between are rearranged in a specific order that is not strictly ascending or descending.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the New Input:**\n- Input: [8, 13, 86, 100, 18, 39, 5, 24]\n- Identify the smallest number: 5\n- Identify the largest number: 100\n- Rearrange the numbers such that the smallest number is towards the start and the largest number is towards the end.\n\nFollowing the pattern observed in the examples, the rearranged list for the input [8, 13, 86, 100, 18, 39, 5, 24] is:\n\n<<<[5, 24, 39, 18, 100, 86, 13, 8]>>>"
