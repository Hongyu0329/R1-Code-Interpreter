    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 55\n   - Output: 106\n   - Analysis: The output is 106, which is 51 more than the input (55 + 51 = 106).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 96\n   - Output: 188\n   - Analysis: The output is 188, which is 92 more than the input (96 + 92 = 188).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 82\n   - Output: 160\n   - Analysis: The output is 160, which is 78 more than the input (82 + 78 = 160).\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: 24\n   - Output: 44\n   - Analysis: The output is 44, which is 20 more than the input (24 + 20 = 44).\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the output is consistently a certain number more than the input. Let's try to identify a pattern in the differences:\n\n- For input 55, the difference is 51.\n- For input 96, the difference is 92.\n- For input 82, the difference is 78.\n- For input 24, the difference is 20.\n\nThe differences (51, 92, 78, 20) do not immediately suggest a simple arithmetic pattern. However, let's consider the possibility that the output is approximately double the input, with some adjustments:\n\n- For input 55, doubling gives 110, and the output is 106 (close to double).\n- For input 96, doubling gives 192, and the output is 188 (close to double).\n- For input 82, doubling gives 164, and the output is 160 (close to double).\n- For input 24, doubling gives 48, and the output is 44 (close to double).\n\nIt seems the output is approximately double the input, but slightly less. Let's apply this reasoning to the new input:\n\n**New Input: 31**\n\n- Double 31 gives 62.\n- The pattern suggests the output should be slightly less than double.\n- Observing the examples, the output is typically 4 less than double the input.\n\nTherefore, for input 31:\n- Double 31 is 62.\n- Subtract 4 to get 58.\n\nThus, the output for input 31 should be 58.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<58>>>"
