    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [40, 56, 32, 58]\n   - Output: [58, 32, 56, 40]\n   - Analysis: The output is a rearrangement of the input. The largest number (58) is placed first, followed by the smallest (32), then the second largest (56), and finally the second smallest (40).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [33, 72, 13, 96, 64, 24, 60]\n   - Output: [60, 24, 64, 96, 13, 72, 33]\n   - Analysis: The output starts with the third largest number (60), followed by the third smallest (24), then the second largest (64), the largest (96), the smallest (13), the second smallest (72), and finally the second largest (33).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [92, 9, 92, 47, 94]\n   - Output: [94, 47, 92, 9, 92]\n   - Analysis: The output starts with the largest number (94), followed by the second largest (47), then the third largest (92), the smallest (9), and finally the second smallest (92).\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [53, 94, 91, 59, 82]\n   - Output: [82, 59, 91, 94, 53]\n   - Analysis: The output starts with the third largest number (82), followed by the third smallest (59), then the second largest (91), the largest (94), and finally the smallest (53).\n\nFrom these analyses, we can deduce that the output is a rearrangement of the input list based on a specific order of largest and smallest elements. The pattern seems to involve alternating between selecting the largest and smallest elements, but the exact order can vary.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the new input:\n\n- **Input: [68, 15, 50]**\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1. Identify the largest number: 68\n2. Identify the smallest number: 15\n3. Identify the middle number: 50\n\nFollowing the pattern of alternating between largest and smallest, we can arrange the numbers as follows:\n- Start with the largest number: 68\n- Then the smallest number: 15\n- Finally, the middle number: 50\n\nThus, the output for the input [68, 15, 50] is:\n\n<<<[68, 15, 50]>>>"
