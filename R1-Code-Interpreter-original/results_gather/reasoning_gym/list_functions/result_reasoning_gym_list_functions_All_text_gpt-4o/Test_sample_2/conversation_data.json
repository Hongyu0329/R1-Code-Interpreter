    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [75, 4, 30, 4, 50, 47, 9, 55]\n   - Output: [75, 4, 30, 4]\n   - Observation: The output list is a subsequence of the input list starting from the beginning and ending at the second occurrence of the number 4.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [44, 13, 75, 66, 20, 13, 36]\n   - Output: [75, 66, 13]\n   - Observation: The output list starts from the first occurrence of the largest number (75) and ends at the first occurrence of the smallest number (13) after 75.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [79, 1, 100, 20, 97, 68, 12, 8]\n   - Output: [1, 100, 97, 68, 12]\n   - Observation: The output list starts from the first occurrence of the smallest number (1) and ends at the first occurrence of the largest number (100) after 1.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [33, 95, 71, 91, 8, 50, 22, 76]\n   - Output: [91, 8, 50, 22]\n   - Observation: The output list starts from the first occurrence of the second largest number (91) and ends at the first occurrence of the smallest number (8) after 91.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the largest and smallest numbers in the list.\n- If the largest number appears before the smallest number, the output list starts from the largest number and ends at the smallest number.\n- If the smallest number appears before the largest number, the output list starts from the smallest number and ends at the largest number.\n- If there are multiple occurrences, consider the first occurrence of each.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\nInput: [38, 49, 41, 28, 27, 58, 69]\n\n- The largest number is 69.\n- The smallest number is 27.\n- The first occurrence of 69 is after the first occurrence of 27.\n\nTherefore, the output list should start from the first occurrence of 27 and end at the first occurrence of 69.\n\nThus, the output list is: [27, 58, 69]\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[27, 58, 69]>>>"
