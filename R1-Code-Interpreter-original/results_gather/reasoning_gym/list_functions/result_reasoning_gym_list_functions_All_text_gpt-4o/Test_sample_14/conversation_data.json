    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [52, 6, 76, 76]\n   - Output: [53, 6, 76, 77]\n   - Analysis: The first element (52) is incremented by 1 to become 53. The last element (76) is also incremented by 1 to become 77. The other elements remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [82, 67, 20, 75, 69, 5]\n   - Output: [83, 67, 20, 75, 69, 6]\n   - Analysis: The first element (82) is incremented by 1 to become 83. The last element (5) is incremented by 1 to become 6. The other elements remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [9, 41, 81]\n   - Output: [10, 41, 82]\n   - Analysis: The first element (9) is incremented by 1 to become 10. The last element (81) is incremented by 1 to become 82. The other elements remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [4, 18, 71]\n   - Output: [5, 18, 72]\n   - Analysis: The first element (4) is incremented by 1 to become 5. The last element (71) is incremented by 1 to become 72. The other elements remain unchanged.\n\n**Identified Pattern:**\n- The first element of the list is incremented by 1.\n- The last element of the list is incremented by 1.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the Given Input:**\n- Input: [68, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 91]\n- First element (68) is incremented by 1 to become 69.\n- Last element (91) is incremented by 1 to become 92.\n- The other elements (43, 92, 98, 12, 51) remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n<<<[69, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 92]>>>"
