    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [35, 12, 99]\n   - Output: [99]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [35, 14, 5, 49, 69, 72, 43, 44, 7]\n   - Output: [5]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [18, 44, 72, 43, 90]\n   - Output: [72]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [21, 1, 56, 100, 12, 77]\n   - Output: [56]\n   - Observation: The output is the largest number in the list.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule involves selecting either the largest or the smallest number from the list. However, the choice between the largest and smallest number seems to depend on some condition.\n\nLet's consider the pattern:\n- In examples 1, 3, and 4, the largest number is chosen.\n- In example 2, the smallest number is chosen.\n\nA possible rule could be:\n- If the list contains a number greater than 50, choose the largest number.\n- If all numbers are 50 or less, choose the smallest number.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\nInput: [9, 1, 41, 94, 58, 14, 6, 12, 86]\n\n- The list contains numbers greater than 50 (94, 58, 86).\n- According to the rule, we should choose the largest number.\n\nThe largest number in the list is 94.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[94]>>>"
