    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [57, 72, 39, 62, 63]\n   - Output: [39]\n   - Observation: 39 is the only number in the list that is not divisible by 3.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [29, 58, 43, 74, 94, 49, 27, 93, 26]\n   - Output: [43]\n   - Observation: 43 is the only number in the list that is not divisible by 2.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [64, 71, 58]\n   - Output: [58]\n   - Observation: 58 is the only number in the list that is not a prime number.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [70, 44, 67, 38]\n   - Output: [67]\n   - Observation: 67 is the only number in the list that is a prime number.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that the rule involves identifying a unique property of one number in the list that distinguishes it from the others. The property could be related to divisibility or primality.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the given input:\n\n- **Input: [35, 70, 19, 13, 83, 34, 36, 57, 76]**\n\n   - Check for divisibility by 2:\n     - 35, 19, 13, 83, 57 are not divisible by 2.\n     - 70, 34, 36, 76 are divisible by 2.\n\n   - Check for divisibility by 3:\n     - 19, 13, 83, 34, 76 are not divisible by 3.\n     - 35, 70, 36, 57 are divisible by 3.\n\n   - Check for primality:\n     - 19, 13, 83 are prime numbers.\n     - 35, 70, 34, 36, 57, 76 are not prime numbers.\n\n   - Check for divisibility by 5:\n     - 35, 70 are divisible by 5.\n     - 19, 13, 83, 34, 36, 57, 76 are not divisible by 5.\n\n   - Check for divisibility by 7:\n     - 35, 70 are divisible by 7.\n     - 19, 13, 83, 34, 36, 57, 76 are not divisible by 7.\n\nThe number 34 is the only number in the list that is divisible by 2 but not by 3, 5, or 7, and it is not a prime number. This makes it unique in the context of the list.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[34]>>>"
