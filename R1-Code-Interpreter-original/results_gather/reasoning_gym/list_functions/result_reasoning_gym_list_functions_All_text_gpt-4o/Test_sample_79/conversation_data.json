    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [41, 64, 25, 51, 54, 79]\n   - Output: [79, 54, 51, 25, 64, 41]\n   - Observation: The output seems to be a rearrangement of the input. The largest number (79) is placed first, followed by the smallest number (54), then the second largest (51), and so on. The pattern alternates between the largest remaining and the smallest remaining numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [81, 25, 90, 54, 72]\n   - Output: [72, 54, 90, 25, 81]\n   - Observation: The output starts with the second largest number (72), followed by the second smallest (54), then the largest (90), the smallest (25), and finally the third largest (81). The pattern alternates similarly to Example 1.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [24, 86, 60, 54, 50, 92]\n   - Output: [92, 50, 54, 60, 86, 24]\n   - Observation: The output starts with the largest number (92), followed by the second smallest (50), then the second largest (54), the third smallest (60), and so on. The pattern alternates between the largest remaining and the smallest remaining numbers.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [49, 29, 92, 93, 99, 45, 64]\n   - Output: [64, 45, 99, 93, 92, 29, 49]\n   - Observation: The output starts with the third largest number (64), followed by the second smallest (45), then the largest (99), the second largest (93), and so on. The pattern alternates similarly to previous examples.\n\n**Pattern Deduction:**\n- The output list is formed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining numbers from the input list.\n- The starting point (whether to start with the largest or second largest) seems to vary, but the alternating pattern is consistent.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the New Input:**\n- Input: [41, 87, 98]\n- Sort the input: [41, 87, 98]\n- Largest: 98\n- Smallest: 41\n- Second largest: 87\n\nFollowing the alternating pattern:\n1. Start with the largest: 98\n2. Next, the smallest: 41\n3. Finally, the second largest: 87\n\nThus, the output for the input [41, 87, 98] is:\n\n<<<[98, 41, 87]>>>"
