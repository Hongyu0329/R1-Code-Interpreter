    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input to the output based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 93\n   - Output: 182\n   - Analysis: The output is 182, which is 93 multiplied by 2 minus 4 (i.e., 93 * 2 - 4 = 186 - 4 = 182).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 53\n   - Output: 102\n   - Analysis: The output is 102, which is 53 multiplied by 2 minus 4 (i.e., 53 * 2 - 4 = 106 - 4 = 102).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 70\n   - Output: 136\n   - Analysis: The output is 136, which is 70 multiplied by 2 minus 4 (i.e., 70 * 2 - 4 = 140 - 4 = 136).\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: 22\n   - Output: 40\n   - Analysis: The output is 40, which is 22 multiplied by 2 minus 4 (i.e., 22 * 2 - 4 = 44 - 4 = 40).\n\nFrom the analysis of these examples, we can deduce the rule:\n- For any given input \\( x \\), the output is calculated as \\( (x \\times 2) - 4 \\).\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input: 80**\n  - Calculation: \\( (80 \\times 2) - 4 = 160 - 4 = 156 \\)\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [80] is:\n\n<<<[156]>>>"
