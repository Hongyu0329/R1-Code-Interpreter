    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps each input list to its corresponding output list. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [99, 78, 91, 34]\n   - Output: [99, 79, 93, 37]\n   - Analysis: \n     - 78 -> 79 (increment by 1)\n     - 91 -> 93 (increment by 2)\n     - 34 -> 37 (increment by 3)\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [45, 9, 20, 54, 43]\n   - Output: [45, 10, 22, 57, 47]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 9 -> 10 (increment by 1)\n     - 20 -> 22 (increment by 2)\n     - 54 -> 57 (increment by 3)\n     - 43 -> 47 (increment by 4)\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [39, 89, 88, 43, 10, 74]\n   - Output: [39, 90, 90, 46, 14, 79]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 89 -> 90 (increment by 1)\n     - 88 -> 90 (increment by 2)\n     - 43 -> 46 (increment by 3)\n     - 10 -> 14 (increment by 4)\n     - 74 -> 79 (increment by 5)\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [60, 80, 1, 29, 19]\n   - Output: [60, 81, 3, 32, 23]\n   - Analysis:\n     - 80 -> 81 (increment by 1)\n     - 1 -> 3 (increment by 2)\n     - 29 -> 32 (increment by 3)\n     - 19 -> 23 (increment by 4)\n\n**Pattern Identification:**\n- The first element of each list remains unchanged.\n- Starting from the second element, each subsequent element is incremented by an increasing integer starting from 1.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the New Input:**\n- Input: [7, 72, 42, 94, 12, 10, 53, 61, 11, 52]\n- Output:\n  - 7 (unchanged)\n  - 72 -> 73 (increment by 1)\n  - 42 -> 44 (increment by 2)\n  - 94 -> 97 (increment by 3)\n  - 12 -> 16 (increment by 4)\n  - 10 -> 15 (increment by 5)\n  - 53 -> 59 (increment by 6)\n  - 61 -> 68 (increment by 7)\n  - 11 -> 19 (increment by 8)\n  - 52 -> 61 (increment by 9)\n\nThus, the output list is: <<<[7, 73, 44, 97, 16, 15, 59, 68, 19, 61]>>>"
