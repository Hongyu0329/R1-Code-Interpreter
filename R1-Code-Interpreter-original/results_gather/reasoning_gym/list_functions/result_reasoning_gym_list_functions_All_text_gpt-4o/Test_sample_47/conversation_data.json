    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [57, 45, 77, 21, 31]\n   - Output: [77]\n   - Observation: 77 is the largest number in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [93, 89, 64, 20, 9, 45]\n   - Output: [64]\n   - Observation: 64 is the smallest number in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [26, 15, 93]\n   - Output: [93]\n   - Observation: 93 is the largest number in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [92, 40, 23, 53, 62, 89, 48, 80, 12, 49]\n   - Output: [23]\n   - Observation: 23 is the smallest number in the list.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule alternates between selecting the largest and smallest number from the list. Specifically:\n- For odd-numbered examples (1 and 3), the largest number is selected.\n- For even-numbered examples (2 and 4), the smallest number is selected.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [34, 100, 63, 6]\n- This is the 5th example (odd-numbered), so we select the largest number from the list.\n\nThe largest number in the list [34, 100, 63, 6] is 100.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[100]>>>"
