    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [90, 21, 75, 80, 5, 5, 60, 5, 54, 86, 97, 85, 39]\n   - Output: [3]\n   - Observation: The number 5 appears multiple times in the list. The output is 3, which is the index of the first occurrence of the number 5.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [94, 96, 78, 87, 22, 89]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 5 does not appear in the list. The output is 0, which seems to be a default value when 5 is not present.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [51, 5, 5, 5, 29, 40, 9, 87, 5, 3, 5, 9, 5]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - Observation: The number 5 appears multiple times. The output is 6, which is the index of the first occurrence of the number 9.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [67, 19, 85, 68, 80, 38, 56, 71, 22]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 5 does not appear in the list. The output is 0, which is consistent with the default value when 5 is not present.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the following rule:\n- If the number 5 is present in the list, the output is the index of the first occurrence of the number 9.\n- If the number 5 is not present, the output is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [5, 9, 22, 5, 5, 96, 78, 41, 5, 90, 5, 5]\n- The number 5 is present in the list.\n- The first occurrence of the number 9 is at index 1.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
