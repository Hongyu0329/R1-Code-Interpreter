    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the given input list to the output list in the examples provided. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [59, 59, 99, 23, 91]\n   - Output: [5]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [94, 45, 56, 65, 15, 69, 16, 11, 95]\n   - Output: [9]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [34, 7, 85, 83, 27, 43, 30, 40, 99, 27]\n   - Output: [10]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [19, 25, 45, 48, 81]\n   - Output: [5]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule is to count the number of elements in the input list and output that count as a single-element list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [27, 52, 60, 72, 36, 49, 21, 84, 82]\n- Count the number of elements: There are 9 elements in the list.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is a list containing the number 9.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<9>>>"
