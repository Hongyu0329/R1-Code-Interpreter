    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps each input list to its corresponding output list. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [93, 90, 95, 28, 89, 10, 78, 95, 16, 84]\n   - Output: [93, 91, 97, 31, 93, 15, 84, 102, 24, 93]\n   - Analysis: \n     - The first element remains the same.\n     - The second element is increased by 1.\n     - The third element is increased by 2.\n     - The fourth element is increased by 3.\n     - The fifth element is increased by 4.\n     - The sixth element is increased by 5.\n     - The seventh element is increased by 6.\n     - The eighth element is increased by 7.\n     - The ninth element is increased by 8.\n     - The tenth element is increased by 9.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [60, 44, 87, 16, 63, 11, 17, 29, 75]\n   - Output: [60, 45, 89, 19, 67, 16, 23, 36, 83]\n   - Analysis:\n     - The first element remains the same.\n     - The second element is increased by 1.\n     - The third element is increased by 2.\n     - The fourth element is increased by 3.\n     - The fifth element is increased by 4.\n     - The sixth element is increased by 5.\n     - The seventh element is increased by 6.\n     - The eighth element is increased by 7.\n     - The ninth element is increased by 8.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [6, 29, 14]\n   - Output: [6, 30, 16]\n   - Analysis:\n     - The first element remains the same.\n     - The second element is increased by 1.\n     - The third element is increased by 2.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [78, 67, 38, 24, 96]\n   - Output: [78, 68, 40, 27, 100]\n   - Analysis:\n     - The first element remains the same.\n     - The second element is increased by 1.\n     - The third element is increased by 2.\n     - The fourth element is increased by 3.\n     - The fifth element is increased by 4.\n\n**Identified Rule:**\n- The first element of the input list remains unchanged in the output list.\n- Each subsequent element in the input list is increased by an incrementing integer starting from 1.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the New Input:**\n- Input: [94, 75, 93, 87, 54, 30, 85, 74, 99]\n- Output:\n  - The first element remains the same: 94.\n  - The second element is increased by 1: 75 + 1 = 76.\n  - The third element is increased by 2: 93 + 2 = 95.\n  - The fourth element is increased by 3: 87 + 3 = 90.\n  - The fifth element is increased by 4: 54 + 4 = 58.\n  - The sixth element is increased by 5: 30 + 5 = 35.\n  - The seventh element is increased by 6: 85 + 6 = 91.\n  - The eighth element is increased by 7: 74 + 7 = 81.\n  - The ninth element is increased by 8: 99 + 8 = 107.\n\nFinal Output: <<<[94, 76, 95, 90, 58, 35, 91, 81, 107]>>>"
