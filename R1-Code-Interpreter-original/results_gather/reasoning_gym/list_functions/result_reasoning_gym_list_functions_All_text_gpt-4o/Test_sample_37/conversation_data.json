    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input list to the output list in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [13, 22, 9]\n   - Output: [44]\n   - Analysis: The sum of the input numbers is 13 + 22 + 9 = 44. The output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [42, 71, 54, 60, 55, 73, 57, 67]\n   - Output: [479]\n   - Analysis: The sum of the input numbers is 42 + 71 + 54 + 60 + 55 + 73 + 57 + 67 = 479. The output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [72, 71, 57, 19, 53, 51, 9, 54]\n   - Output: [386]\n   - Analysis: The sum of the input numbers is 72 + 71 + 57 + 19 + 53 + 51 + 9 + 54 = 386. The output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [19, 26, 19, 40, 28, 89, 85]\n   - Output: [306]\n   - Analysis: The sum of the input numbers is 19 + 26 + 19 + 40 + 28 + 89 + 85 = 306. The output is the sum of the input numbers.\n\nFrom the analysis of these examples, we can deduce that the rule is to sum all the elements in the input list and output the sum as a single-element list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- **Input:** [14, 13, 50, 80, 94, 9]\n- **Sum of the input numbers:** 14 + 13 + 50 + 80 + 94 + 9 = 260\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is the sum of the input numbers.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[260]>>>"
