  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [52, 6, 76, 76]\nOutput 1: [53, 6, 76, 77]\nInput 2: [82, 67, 20, 75, 69, 5]\nOutput 2: [83, 67, 20, 75, 69, 6]\nInput 3: [9, 41, 81]\nOutput 3: [10, 41, 82]\nInput 4: [4, 18, 71]\nOutput 4: [5, 18, 72]\n\n\nInput: [68, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 91]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [52, 6, 76, 76] → Output: [53, 6, 76, 77]\n2. Input: [82, 67, 20, 75, 69, 5] → Output: [83, 67, 20, 75, 69, 6]\n3. Input: [9, 41, 81] → Output: [10, 41, 82]\n4. Input: [4, 18, 71] → Output: [5, 18, 72]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n- The first and the last elements of the input list are incremented by 1 to produce the output list.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nApplying this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [68, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 91]\n\n- Increment the first element (68) by 1 to get 69.\n- Increment the last element (91) by 1 to get 92.\n- Keep all other elements the same.\n\nOutput: [69, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 92]\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<<<[69, 43, 92, 98, 12, 51, 92]>>>"
