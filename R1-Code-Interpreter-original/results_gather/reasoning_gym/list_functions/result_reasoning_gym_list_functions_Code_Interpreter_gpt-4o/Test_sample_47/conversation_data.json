Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [57, 45, 77, 21, 31]\nOutput 1: [77]\nInput 2: [93, 89, 64, 20, 9, 45]\nOutput 2: [64]\nInput 3: [26, 15, 93]\nOutput 3: [93]\nInput 4: [92, 40, 23, 53, 62, 89, 48, 80, 12, 49]\nOutput 4: [23]\n\n\nInput: [34, 100, 63, 6]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [57, 45, 77, 21, 31] → Output: [77]\n2. Input: [93, 89, 64, 20, 9, 45] → Output: [64]\n3. Input: [26, 15, 93] → Output: [93]\n4. Input: [92, 40, 23, 53, 62, 89, 48, 80, 12, 49] → Output: [23]\n\nObservations:\n- In each example, the output is a single number from the input list.\n- The number selected as the output is the one with the highest value in the tens place.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input: [34, 100, 63, 6].\n\n- 34 has a tens digit of 3.\n- 100 has a tens digit of 0.\n- 63 has a tens digit of 6.\n- 6 has a tens digit of 0 (since it's a single-digit number).\n\nThe number with the highest tens digit is 63.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [34, 100, 63, 6] is:\n\n<<<[63]>>>"
