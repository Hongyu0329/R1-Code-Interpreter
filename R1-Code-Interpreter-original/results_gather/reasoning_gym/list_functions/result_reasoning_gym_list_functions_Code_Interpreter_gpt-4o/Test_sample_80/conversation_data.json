    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [90, 21, 75, 80, 5, 5, 60, 5, 54, 86, 97, 85, 39]\n   - Output: [3]\n   - Observation: The number 5 appears 4 times in the input list. The output is 3, which is one less than the count of 5s.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [94, 96, 78, 87, 22, 89]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 5 does not appear in the input list. The output is 0.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [51, 5, 5, 5, 29, 40, 9, 87, 5, 3, 5, 9, 5]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - Observation: The number 5 appears 7 times in the input list. The output is 6, which is one less than the count of 5s.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [67, 19, 85, 68, 80, 38, 56, 71, 22]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 5 does not appear in the input list. The output is 0.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems the rule is to count the number of times the number 5 appears in the input list and subtract 1 from that count to get the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- Input: [5, 9, 22, 5, 5, 96, 78, 41, 5, 90, 5, 5]\n\nLet's count the number of times 5 appears in this list and subtract 1.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Count the number of times 5 appears in the input list and subtract 1\ninput_list = [5, 9, 22, 5, 5, 96, 78, 41, 5, 90, 5, 5]\ncount_of_5 = input_list.count(5)\noutput = count_of_5 - 1\noutput\nassistant > The number 5 appears 6 times in the input list. According to the rule, we subtract 1 from this count, resulting in an output of 5. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[5]>>>"
