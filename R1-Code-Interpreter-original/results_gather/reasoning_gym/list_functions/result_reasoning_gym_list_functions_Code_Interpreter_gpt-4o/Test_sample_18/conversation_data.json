Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [4445]\nOutput 1: [0]\nInput 2: [640]\nOutput 2: [1]\nInput 3: [2295]\nOutput 3: [0]\nInput 4: [350]\nOutput 4: [1]\n\n\nInput: [2915]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [4445] → Output: [0]\n2. Input: [640] → Output: [1]\n3. Input: [2295] → Output: [0]\n4. Input: [350] → Output: [1]\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is determined by whether the input number is divisible by 5. If the number is divisible by 5, the output is [0]; otherwise, the output is [1].\n\nLet's verify this rule with the given input [2915]:\n\n- 2915 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5).\n\nTherefore, according to the rule, the output should be [0].\n\nSo, the output for the input [2915] is:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
