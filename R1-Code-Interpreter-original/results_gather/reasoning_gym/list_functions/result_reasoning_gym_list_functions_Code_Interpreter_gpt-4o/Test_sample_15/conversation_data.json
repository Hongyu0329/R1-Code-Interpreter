    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [9, 56, 71, 59, 74, 44, 33, 66]\n   Output 1: [66, 33, 44, 74, 59, 71, 56, 9]\n   \n2. Input 2: [51, 79, 6, 54, 85, 4, 14, 1, 34]\n   Output 2: [34, 1, 14, 4, 85, 54, 6, 79, 51]\n   \n3. Input 3: [93, 70, 2, 41, 73, 55, 30, 31, 67, 66]\n   Output 3: [66, 67, 31, 30, 55, 73, 41, 2, 70, 93]\n   \n4. Input 4: [57, 31, 5, 72, 48, 92, 89, 46]\n   Output 4: [46, 89, 92, 48, 72, 5, 31, 57]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to be a rearrangement of the input.\n- The output is divided into two parts: the first part is sorted in ascending order, and the second part is sorted in descending order.\n- The division point is approximately the middle of the list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input: [72, 74, 98, 26, 31, 94, 5, 17].\n\n1. Divide the list into two parts:\n   - First part: [72, 74, 98, 26]\n   - Second part: [31, 94, 5, 17]\n\n2. Sort the first part in ascending order and the second part in descending order:\n   - First part sorted: [26, 72, 74, 98]\n   - Second part sorted: [94, 31, 17, 5]\n\n3. Concatenate the two sorted parts to form the output.\n\nLet's compute the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given input\ninput_list = [72, 74, 98, 26, 31, 94, 5, 17]\n\n# Divide the list into two parts\nmid_index = len(input_list) // 2\nfirst_part = input_list[:mid_index]\nsecond_part = input_list[mid_index:]\n\n# Sort the first part in ascending order and the second part in descending order\nfirst_part_sorted = sorted(first_part)\nsecond_part_sorted = sorted(second_part, reverse=True)\n\n# Concatenate the two sorted parts to form the output\noutput_list = first_part_sorted + second_part_sorted\noutput_list\nassistant > The output corresponding to the given input [72, 74, 98, 26, 31, 94, 5, 17] is:\n\n<<<[26, 72, 74, 98, 94, 31, 17, 5]>>>"
