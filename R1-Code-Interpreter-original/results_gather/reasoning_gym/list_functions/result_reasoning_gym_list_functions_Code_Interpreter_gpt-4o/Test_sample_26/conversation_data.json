    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [27, 95, 83, 26, 6, 25] → Output 1: [25, 6, 26, 83, 95, 27]\n2. Input 2: [52, 46, 37, 34, 58, 79, 54, 37, 75, 14] → Output 2: [14, 75, 37, 54, 79, 58, 34, 37, 46, 52]\n3. Input 3: [63, 28, 61] → Output 3: [61, 28, 63]\n4. Input 4: [58, 71, 85, 49] → Output 4: [49, 85, 71, 58]\n\nObservations:\n- The output is the reverse of the input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [8, 13, 86, 100, 18, 39, 5, 24]\n\nReversing the input list gives us the output:\n\nOutput: [24, 5, 39, 18, 100, 86, 13, 8]\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[24, 5, 39, 18, 100, 86, 13, 8]>>>"
