  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [25, 43, 24, 81, 2, 68, 99, 90, 2]\nOutput 1: [43, 81, 2, 99, 90]\nInput 2: [88, 60, 18, 29, 16, 89, 18, 78]\nOutput 2: [88, 60, 29, 89, 18]\nInput 3: [57, 53, 42, 86, 56]\nOutput 3: [53, 42, 86]\nInput 4: [40, 21, 16, 60, 44]\nOutput 4: [21, 16, 60]\n\n\nInput: [20, 32, 57]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [25, 43, 24, 81, 2, 68, 99, 90, 2]  \n   Output 1: [43, 81, 2, 99, 90]  \n   - The output includes numbers that are either prime or even.\n\n2. Input 2: [88, 60, 18, 29, 16, 89, 18, 78]  \n   Output 2: [88, 60, 29, 89, 18]  \n   - The output includes numbers that are either prime or even.\n\n3. Input 3: [57, 53, 42, 86, 56]  \n   Output 3: [53, 42, 86]  \n   - The output includes numbers that are either prime or even.\n\n4. Input 4: [40, 21, 16, 60, 44]  \n   Output 4: [21, 16, 60]  \n   - The output includes numbers that are either prime or even.\n\nThe rule seems to be that the output includes numbers that are either prime or even. Let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [20, 32, 57]\n\n- 20 is even.\n- 32 is even.\n- 57 is neither prime nor even.\n\nTherefore, the output should include 20 and 32.\n\nOutput: <<<[20, 32]>>>"
