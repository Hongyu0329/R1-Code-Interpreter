Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [77, 95, 24, 45]\nOutput 1: [241]\nInput 2: [40, 95, 92, 88, 77, 17, 90, 89]\nOutput 2: [588]\nInput 3: [30, 49, 19, 82, 4, 89, 29, 59]\nOutput 3: [361]\nInput 4: [58, 9, 99]\nOutput 4: [166]\n\n\nInput: [12, 65, 41, 93, 3, 54, 33]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [77, 95, 24, 45] → Output: [241]\n2. Input: [40, 95, 92, 88, 77, 17, 90, 89] → Output: [588]\n3. Input: [30, 49, 19, 82, 4, 89, 29, 59] → Output: [361]\n4. Input: [58, 9, 99] → Output: [166]\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is the sum of all the numbers in the input list. Let's verify this hypothesis by calculating the sum for each input and checking if it matches the output.\n\n- For Input 1: 77 + 95 + 24 + 45 = 241\n- For Input 2: 40 + 95 + 92 + 88 + 77 + 17 + 90 + 89 = 588\n- For Input 3: 30 + 49 + 19 + 82 + 4 + 89 + 29 + 59 = 361\n- For Input 4: 58 + 9 + 99 = 166\n\nThe hypothesis holds true for all examples. Therefore, the rule is to sum all the elements in the input list to get the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input: [12, 65, 41, 93, 3, 54, 33].\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given input\ninput_list = [12, 65, 41, 93, 3, 54, 33]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the input list\noutput = sum(input_list)\noutput\nassistant > The output for the input [12, 65, 41, 93, 3, 54, 33] is the sum of its elements, which is 301. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[301]>>>"
