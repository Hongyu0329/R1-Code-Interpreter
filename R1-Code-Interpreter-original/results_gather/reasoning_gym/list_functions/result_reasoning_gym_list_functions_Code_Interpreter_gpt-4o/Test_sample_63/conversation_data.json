    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: 64 → Output: 124\n2. Input: 78 → Output: 152\n3. Input: 96 → Output: 188\n4. Input: 24 → Output: 44\n\nLet's calculate the difference between each input and output:\n\n1. 124 - 64 = 60\n2. 152 - 78 = 74\n3. 188 - 96 = 92\n4. 44 - 24 = 20\n\nNow, let's examine the pattern in the differences:\n\n- The differences are 60, 74, 92, and 20.\n- These differences do not form a simple arithmetic sequence, so let's check if they are related to the input values.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio of the output to the input:\n\n1. 124 / 64 ≈ 1.9375\n2. 152 / 78 ≈ 1.9487\n3. 188 / 96 ≈ 1.9583\n4. 44 / 24 ≈ 1.8333\n\nThe ratios are approximately 1.9375, 1.9487, 1.9583, and 1.8333. These ratios are not consistent, so let's try another approach.\n\nLet's check if the output is a linear function of the input, i.e., Output = a * Input + b.\n\nWe can use two points to find the coefficients a and b. Let's use the first two examples:\n\n1. 124 = a * 64 + b\n2. 152 = a * 78 + b\n\nSolving these equations will give us the values of a and b. Let's calculate them.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\na, b = symbols('a b')\n\n# Define the equations based on the first two examples\neq1 = Eq(a * 64 + b, 124)\neq2 = Eq(a * 78 + b, 152)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, b))\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the equations gives us \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = -4 \\). This means the rule that maps the input to the output is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times \\text{Input} - 4 \\]\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given input [15]:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times 15 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26 \\]\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [15] is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 26 \\]\n\nSo, the output is:\n\n<<<[26]>>>"
