  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [71, 1, 23, 8, 54, 36, 47]\nOutput 1: [23, 8, 54]\nInput 2: [41, 22, 51]\nOutput 2: [41]\nInput 3: [54, 3, 70, 61, 79, 55, 3]\nOutput 3: [3]\nInput 4: [28, 13, 52, 41, 27, 19]\nOutput 4: [13]\n\n\nInput: [25, 99, 84, 46, 69, 38, 97, 52, 22]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [71, 1, 23, 8, 54, 36, 47] → Output: [23, 8, 54]\n2. Input: [41, 22, 51] → Output: [41]\n3. Input: [54, 3, 70, 61, 79, 55, 3] → Output: [3]\n4. Input: [28, 13, 52, 41, 27, 19] → Output: [13]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to consist of numbers from the input list that are the smallest in some way.\n- In each example, the output contains the smallest number(s) from the input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [25, 99, 84, 46, 69, 38, 97, 52, 22]\n\nThe smallest number in this list is 22. Therefore, the output should be:\n\n<<<[22]>>>"
