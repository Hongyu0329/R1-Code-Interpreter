    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [3755] → Output: [0]\n2. Input: [590] → Output: [1]\n3. Input: [2675] → Output: [0]\n4. Input: [750] → Output: [1]\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is determined by whether the input number is divisible by a certain number. Let's check the divisibility of each input by 5:\n\n- 3755 is divisible by 5 (3755 ÷ 5 = 751), and the output is 0.\n- 590 is divisible by 5 (590 ÷ 5 = 118), and the output is 1.\n- 2675 is divisible by 5 (2675 ÷ 5 = 535), and the output is 0.\n- 750 is divisible by 5 (750 ÷ 5 = 150), and the output is 1.\n\nSince all numbers are divisible by 5, let's check divisibility by 10:\n\n- 3755 is not divisible by 10, and the output is 0.\n- 590 is not divisible by 10, and the output is 1.\n- 2675 is not divisible by 10, and the output is 0.\n- 750 is divisible by 10, and the output is 1.\n\nIt appears that the output is 1 if the number is divisible by 10, and 0 otherwise.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the input [295]:\n\n- 295 is not divisible by 10.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [295] should be 0.\n\nThe output is: <<<[0]>>>"
