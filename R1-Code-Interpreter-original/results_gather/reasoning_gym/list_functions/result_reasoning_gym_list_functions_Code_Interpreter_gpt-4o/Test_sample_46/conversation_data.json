  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [13, 39, 86, 94, 33, 3]\nOutput 1: [94]\nInput 2: [84, 19, 1]\nOutput 2: [19]\nInput 3: [90, 61, 49, 70, 2, 5]\nOutput 3: [5]\nInput 4: [45, 55, 44, 81, 1]\nOutput 4: [55]\n\n\nInput: [100, 97, 47, 47, 1]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [13, 39, 86, 94, 33, 3] → Output: [94]\n2. Input: [84, 19, 1] → Output: [19]\n3. Input: [90, 61, 49, 70, 2, 5] → Output: [5]\n4. Input: [45, 55, 44, 81, 1] → Output: [55]\n\nObservations:\n- In each example, the output is a single number from the input list.\n- The output number is the one with the highest second digit when the numbers are considered in their decimal form.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input: [100, 97, 47, 47, 1].\n\n- 100: second digit is 0\n- 97: second digit is 9\n- 47: second digit is 4\n- 47: second digit is 4\n- 1: no second digit\n\nThe number with the highest second digit is 97.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [100, 97, 47, 47, 1] is:\n\n<<<[97]>>>"
