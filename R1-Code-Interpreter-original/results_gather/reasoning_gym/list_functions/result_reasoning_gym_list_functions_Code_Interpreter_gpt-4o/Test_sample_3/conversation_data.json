Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [97, 194, 388, 776, 1552, 3104, 6208, 12416]\nOutput 1: [24832]\nInput 2: [84, 168, 336, 672, 1344, 2688, 5376]\nOutput 2: [10752]\nInput 3: [93, 186, 372]\nOutput 3: [744]\nInput 4: [44, 88, 176]\nOutput 4: [352]\n\n\nInput: [31, 62, 124]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. In Example 1, each number in the input list is doubled to get the next number. The output is the next number in this sequence, which is also double the last number in the input list.\n2. In Example 2, the same pattern is observed: each number is doubled to get the next number, and the output is double the last number in the input list.\n3. Example 3 follows the same pattern: each number is doubled, and the output is double the last number in the input list.\n4. Example 4 also follows this pattern.\n\nThe rule is to double the last number in the input list to get the output.\n\nApplying this rule to the new input [31, 62, 124]:\n\n- The last number in the input list is 124.\n- Doubling 124 gives 248.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[248]>>>"
