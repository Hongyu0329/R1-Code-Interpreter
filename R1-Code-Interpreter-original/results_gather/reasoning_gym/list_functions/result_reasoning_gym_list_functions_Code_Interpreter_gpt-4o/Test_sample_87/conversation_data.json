    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Input: [24, 95, 69, 86, 97, 71, 97] → Output: [69]\n2. **Example 2**: Input: [14, 11, 55, 81, 32, 23, 33, 36, 27] → Output: [81, 33]\n3. **Example 3**: Input: [75, 3, 52, 91, 33, 56, 96, 94, 8, 87] → Output: [3, 33, 56, 96, 94]\n4. **Example 4**: Input: [27, 17, 60, 2, 67, 67, 93, 64] → Output: [17, 60, 93]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to consist of numbers from the input list that satisfy a certain condition.\n- The numbers in the output are not necessarily the largest or smallest, nor are they in any specific order.\n- The numbers in the output are not repeated, even if they appear multiple times in the input.\n\nLet's look for a common property among the numbers in each output:\n- **Example 1**: 69 is divisible by 3.\n- **Example 2**: 81 and 33 are divisible by 3.\n- **Example 3**: 3, 33, 56, 96, and 94 are divisible by 3.\n- **Example 4**: 17, 60, and 93 are divisible by 3.\n\nThe rule seems to be that the output consists of numbers from the input list that are divisible by 3.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input: [14, 6, 31, 28, 62, 49, 61, 69, 78].\n\nWe'll extract the numbers that are divisible by 3.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the input list\ninput_list = [14, 6, 31, 28, 62, 49, 61, 69, 78]\n\n# Apply the rule: select numbers divisible by 3\noutput_list = [num for num in input_list if num % 3 == 0]\noutput_list\nassistant > The numbers from the input list that are divisible by 3 are 6, 69, and 78. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[6, 69, 78]>>>"
