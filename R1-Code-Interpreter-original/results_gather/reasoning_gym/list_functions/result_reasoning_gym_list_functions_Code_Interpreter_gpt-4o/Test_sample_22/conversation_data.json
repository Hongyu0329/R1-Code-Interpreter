Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [57, 72, 39, 62, 63]\nOutput 1: [39]\nInput 2: [29, 58, 43, 74, 94, 49, 27, 93, 26]\nOutput 2: [43]\nInput 3: [64, 71, 58]\nOutput 3: [58]\nInput 4: [70, 44, 67, 38]\nOutput 4: [67]\n\n\nInput: [35, 70, 19, 13, 83, 34, 36, 57, 76]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [57, 72, 39, 62, 63] → Output: [39]\n2. Input: [29, 58, 43, 74, 94, 49, 27, 93, 26] → Output: [43]\n3. Input: [64, 71, 58] → Output: [58]\n4. Input: [70, 44, 67, 38] → Output: [67]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to be the smallest odd number in the list.\n- In each example, the output is a single number, which is the smallest odd number from the input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [35, 70, 19, 13, 83, 34, 36, 57, 76]\n\nWe'll find the smallest odd number in this list.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given input list\ninput_list = [35, 70, 19, 13, 83, 34, 36, 57, 76]\n\n# Filter out odd numbers\nodd_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 != 0]\n\n# Find the smallest odd number\nsmallest_odd = min(odd_numbers)\nsmallest_odd\nassistant > The smallest odd number in the input list [35, 70, 19, 13, 83, 34, 36, 57, 76] is 13.
