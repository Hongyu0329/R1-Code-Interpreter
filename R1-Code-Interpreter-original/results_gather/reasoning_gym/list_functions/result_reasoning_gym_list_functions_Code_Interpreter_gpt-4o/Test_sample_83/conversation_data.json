    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's examine the given examples:\n\n1. Input: 97 → Output: 190\n2. Input: 44 → Output: 84\n3. Input: 63 → Output: 122\n4. Input: 24 → Output: 44\n\nLet's analyze the differences between the inputs and outputs:\n\n- For Input 1: 190 - 97 = 93\n- For Input 2: 84 - 44 = 40\n- For Input 3: 122 - 63 = 59\n- For Input 4: 44 - 24 = 20\n\nThe differences are 93, 40, 59, and 20. These differences do not form a simple arithmetic sequence, so let's try to find a pattern or rule.\n\nLet's check if the output is approximately double the input:\n\n- For Input 1: 97 * 2 = 194 (close to 190)\n- For Input 2: 44 * 2 = 88 (close to 84)\n- For Input 3: 63 * 2 = 126 (close to 122)\n- For Input 4: 24 * 2 = 48 (close to 44)\n\nThe outputs are approximately double the inputs, but slightly less. Let's calculate the exact difference:\n\n- For Input 1: 194 - 190 = 4\n- For Input 2: 88 - 84 = 4\n- For Input 3: 126 - 122 = 4\n- For Input 4: 48 - 44 = 4\n\nThe rule seems to be: Output = (Input * 2) - 4\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: 43\n\nOutput = (43 * 2) - 4\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Applying the rule to the new input\ninput_value = 43\noutput_value = (input_value * 2) - 4\noutput_value\nassistant > The output for the input [43] is [82]. Therefore, the result is:\n\n<<<[82]>>>"
