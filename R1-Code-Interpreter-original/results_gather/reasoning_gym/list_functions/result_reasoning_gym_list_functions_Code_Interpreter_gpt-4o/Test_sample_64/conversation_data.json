    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [41, 87, 51, 27, 13, 44, 98, 6]\n   - Output: [8]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [22, 53, 83]\n   - Output: [3]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [12, 33, 44, 46, 36, 17, 65, 2]\n   - Output: [8]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [70, 62, 57, 41, 32, 89, 45, 68, 66, 42]\n   - Output: [10]\n   - Observation: The output is the count of numbers in the input list.\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the rule is to count the number of elements in the input list and return that count as the output.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input:** [22, 8, 16]\n- **Count of elements:** 3\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n\n<<<[3]>>>"
