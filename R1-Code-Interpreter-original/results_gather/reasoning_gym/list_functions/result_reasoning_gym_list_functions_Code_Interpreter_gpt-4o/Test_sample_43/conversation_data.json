    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [66, 75, 5, 59, 6, 86, 61, 5, 87, 5, 94, 5, 99, 5, 56, 5]\n   - Output: [6]\n   - Observation: The number 6 appears once in the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [88, 17, 26, 70, 60, 74, 19, 26, 87]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 0 does not appear in the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [42, 35, 5, 25, 8]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The number 1 does not appear in the list.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [15, 38, 60, 67, 73, 87, 38, 84]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The number 0 does not appear in the list.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems the output is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the input list. Let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input:** [5, 38, 5, 5, 68, 71, 71, 3, 100, 5, 21, 57]\n\nLet's find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given input list\ninput_list = [5, 38, 5, 5, 68, 71, 71, 3, 100, 5, 21, 57]\n\n# Function to find the smallest non-negative integer not in the list\ndef find_missing_integer(lst):\n    i = 0\n    while i in lst:\n        i += 1\n    return i\n\n# Find the missing integer for the given input\nmissing_integer = find_missing_integer(input_list)\nmissing_integer\nassistant > The smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the input list [5, 38, 5, 5, 68, 71, 71, 3, 100, 5, 21, 57] is 0. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
