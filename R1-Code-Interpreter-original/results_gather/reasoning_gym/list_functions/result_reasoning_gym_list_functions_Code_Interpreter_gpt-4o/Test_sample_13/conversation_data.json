Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [54, 63, 33, 11, 39, 44, 3]\nOutput 1: [54, 63, 33, 11, 39, 44, 3]\nInput 2: [62, 2, 15, 37]\nOutput 2: [62, 2, 15, 37]\nInput 3: [40, 96, 84, 5]\nOutput 3: [40, 96, 84, 5]\nInput 4: [18, 35, 95, 20]\nOutput 4: [18, 35, 95, 20]\n\n\nInput: [98, 92, 55, 10, 79, 53]\nOutput:\n",
