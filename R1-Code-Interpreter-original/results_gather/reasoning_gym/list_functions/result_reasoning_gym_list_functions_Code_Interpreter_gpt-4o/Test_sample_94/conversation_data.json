    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [74, 77, 59] → Output: [74, 78, 61]\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element increases by 1.\n   - The third element increases by 2.\n\n2. Input: [83, 23, 61, 61, 30, 21] → Output: [83, 24, 63, 64, 34, 26]\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element increases by 1.\n   - The third element increases by 2.\n   - The fourth element increases by 3.\n   - The fifth element increases by 4.\n   - The sixth element increases by 5.\n\n3. Input: [81, 63, 12, 95, 87] → Output: [81, 64, 14, 98, 91]\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element increases by 1.\n   - The third element increases by 2.\n   - The fourth element increases by 3.\n   - The fifth element increases by 4.\n\n4. Input: [69, 19, 46, 26, 98, 64, 50] → Output: [69, 20, 48, 29, 102, 69, 56]\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element increases by 1.\n   - The third element increases by 2.\n   - The fourth element increases by 3.\n   - The fifth element increases by 4.\n   - The sixth element increases by 5.\n   - The seventh element increases by 6.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the rule: \n- The first element remains unchanged.\n- Each subsequent element increases by an incrementing integer starting from 1.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the input [54, 53, 36]:\n\n- The first element remains the same: 54\n- The second element increases by 1: 53 + 1 = 54\n- The third element increases by 2: 36 + 2 = 38\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[54, 54, 38]>>>"
