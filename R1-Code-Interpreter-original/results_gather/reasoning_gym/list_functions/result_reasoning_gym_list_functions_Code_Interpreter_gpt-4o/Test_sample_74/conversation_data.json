    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the given inputs to their respective outputs, let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [635] → Output: [0]\n2. Input: [910] → Output: [1]\n3. Input: [1125] → Output: [0]\n4. Input: [620] → Output: [1]\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is determined by some property of the input number. Let's break down the inputs:\n\n- 635: Output is 0\n- 910: Output is 1\n- 1125: Output is 0\n- 620: Output is 1\n\nOne possible pattern is that the output is determined by whether the input number is divisible by a certain number. Let's check if the numbers are divisible by 5:\n\n- 635 % 5 = 0 (divisible by 5)\n- 910 % 5 = 0 (divisible by 5)\n- 1125 % 5 = 0 (divisible by 5)\n- 620 % 5 = 0 (divisible by 5)\n\nSince all numbers are divisible by 5, this is not the distinguishing factor. Let's check divisibility by 10:\n\n- 635 % 10 = 5 (not divisible by 10)\n- 910 % 10 = 0 (divisible by 10)\n- 1125 % 10 = 5 (not divisible by 10)\n- 620 % 10 = 0 (divisible by 10)\n\nIt appears that the output is 1 if the number is divisible by 10, and 0 otherwise.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the input [1475]:\n\n- 1475 % 10 = 5 (not divisible by 10)\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [1475] should be 0.\n\nThe output is: <<<[0]>>>"
