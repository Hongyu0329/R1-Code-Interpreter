    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [59, 59, 99, 23, 91]\n   - Output: [5]\n   \n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [94, 45, 56, 65, 15, 69, 16, 11, 95]\n   - Output: [9]\n   \n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [34, 7, 85, 83, 27, 43, 30, 40, 99, 27]\n   - Output: [10]\n   \n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [19, 25, 45, 48, 81]\n   - Output: [5]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to be related to the number of elements in the input list.\n- The output is the count of elements in the input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- Input: [27, 52, 60, 72, 36, 49, 21, 84, 82]\n- Count of elements: 9\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n\n<<<[9]>>>"
