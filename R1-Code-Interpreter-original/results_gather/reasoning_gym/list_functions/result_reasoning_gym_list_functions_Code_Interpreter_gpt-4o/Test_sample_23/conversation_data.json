  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [26, 20, 95, 39]\nOutput 1: [39, 95, 20, 26]\nInput 2: [96, 24, 39, 12]\nOutput 2: [12, 39, 24, 96]\nInput 3: [93, 85, 61, 70, 50, 50, 65, 52]\nOutput 3: [52, 65, 50, 50, 70, 61, 85, 93]\nInput 4: [93, 55, 69, 99, 81, 6, 81, 33]\nOutput 4: [33, 81, 6, 81, 99, 69, 55, 93]\n\n\nInput: [30, 66, 91]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [26, 20, 95, 39] → Output 1: [39, 95, 20, 26]\n2. Input 2: [96, 24, 39, 12] → Output 2: [12, 39, 24, 96]\n3. Input 3: [93, 85, 61, 70, 50, 50, 65, 52] → Output 3: [52, 65, 50, 50, 70, 61, 85, 93]\n4. Input 4: [93, 55, 69, 99, 81, 6, 81, 33] → Output 4: [33, 81, 6, 81, 99, 69, 55, 93]\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the rule is to sort the list in ascending order and then reverse the order of the elements. Let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [30, 66, 91]\n\n1. Sort the list in ascending order: [30, 66, 91]\n2. Reverse the order: [91, 66, 30]\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [30, 66, 91] is:\n\n<<<[91, 66, 30]>>>"
