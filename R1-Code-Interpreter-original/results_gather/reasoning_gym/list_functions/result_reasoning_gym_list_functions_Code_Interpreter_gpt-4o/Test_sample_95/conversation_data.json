Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [80, 75, 73]\nOutput 1: [73]\nInput 2: [4, 4, 35, 26]\nOutput 2: [35]\nInput 3: [30, 39, 87, 86, 40, 49, 8, 41, 38]\nOutput 3: [87]\nInput 4: [49, 14, 12, 95]\nOutput 4: [12]\n\n\nInput: [45, 3, 61, 23, 94, 78, 92, 48]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [80, 75, 73] → Output: [73]\n2. Input: [4, 4, 35, 26] → Output: [35]\n3. Input: [30, 39, 87, 86, 40, 49, 8, 41, 38] → Output: [87]\n4. Input: [49, 14, 12, 95] → Output: [12]\n\nObservations:\n- In each example, the output is a single number from the input list.\n- The output number is the smallest number in the input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [45, 3, 61, 23, 94, 78, 92, 48]\n\nThe smallest number in this list is 3.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[3]>>>"
