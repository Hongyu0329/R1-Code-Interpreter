    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [67, 70, 90, 15, 23, 49, 29, 38, 4]\n   - Output: [67, 71, 92, 18, 27, 54, 35, 45, 12]\n   \n   Observations:\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element is increased by 1.\n   - The third element is increased by 2.\n   - The fourth element is increased by 3.\n   - The fifth element is increased by 4.\n   - The sixth element is increased by 5.\n   - The seventh element is increased by 6.\n   - The eighth element is increased by 7.\n   - The ninth element is increased by 8.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [15, 73, 2, 13, 21, 100]\n   - Output: [15, 74, 4, 16, 25, 105]\n   \n   Observations:\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element is increased by 1.\n   - The third element is increased by 2.\n   - The fourth element is increased by 3.\n   - The fifth element is increased by 4.\n   - The sixth element is increased by 5.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [89, 82, 49, 76, 52, 99, 89]\n   - Output: [89, 83, 51, 79, 56, 104, 95]\n   \n   Observations:\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element is increased by 1.\n   - The third element is increased by 2.\n   - The fourth element is increased by 3.\n   - The fifth element is increased by 4.\n   - The sixth element is increased by 5.\n   - The seventh element is increased by 6.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [46, 10, 44, 37, 80, 21, 15, 66]\n   - Output: [46, 11, 46, 40, 84, 26, 21, 73]\n   \n   Observations:\n   - The first element remains the same.\n   - The second element is increased by 1.\n   - The third element is increased by 2.\n   - The fourth element is increased by 3.\n   - The fifth element is increased by 4.\n   - The sixth element is increased by 5.\n   - The seventh element is increased by 6.\n   - The eighth element is increased by 7.\n\nFrom these observations, the rule is that each element in the list is increased by its index (starting from 0).\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- Input: [76, 13, 35, 41]\n\nApplying the rule:\n- The first element remains the same: 76\n- The second element is increased by 1: 13 + 1 = 14\n- The third element is increased by 2: 35 + 2 = 37\n- The fourth element is increased by 3: 41 + 3 = 44\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[76, 14, 37, 44]>>>"
