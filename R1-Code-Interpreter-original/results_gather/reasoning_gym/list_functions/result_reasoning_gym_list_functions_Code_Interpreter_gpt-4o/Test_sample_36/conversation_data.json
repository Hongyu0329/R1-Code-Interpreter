Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [89, 96, 65, 15, 78, 75, 32, 56, 61, 34]\nOutput 1: [90, 96, 65, 15, 78, 75, 32, 56, 61, 35]\nInput 2: [57, 71, 47, 22, 71, 84, 100, 100]\nOutput 2: [58, 71, 47, 22, 71, 84, 100, 101]\nInput 3: [6, 70, 94, 62]\nOutput 3: [7, 70, 94, 63]\nInput 4: [44, 8, 12, 78]\nOutput 4: [45, 8, 12, 79]\n\n\nInput: [25, 100, 25, 1, 68]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. In Example 1, the first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1.\n2. In Example 2, the first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1.\n3. In Example 3, the first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1.\n4. In Example 4, the first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1.\n\nThe rule appears to be that the first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1, while the other elements remain unchanged.\n\nApplying this rule to the input [25, 100, 25, 1, 68]:\n\n- Increment the first element (25) by 1 to get 26.\n- Increment the last element (68) by 1 to get 69.\n\nThe output list will be [26, 100, 25, 1, 69].\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<<<[26, 100, 25, 1, 69]>>>"
