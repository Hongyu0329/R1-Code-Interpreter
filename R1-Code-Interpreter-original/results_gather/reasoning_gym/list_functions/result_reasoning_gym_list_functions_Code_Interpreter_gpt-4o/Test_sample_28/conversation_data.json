Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [37, 74, 20, 34, 30, 62, 60]\nOutput 1: [37, 74, 20, 34, 30, 62, 60]\nInput 2: [6, 12, 86, 24, 20, 50, 6, 31]\nOutput 2: [6, 12, 86, 24, 20, 50, 6, 31]\nInput 3: [53, 93, 22]\nOutput 3: [53, 93, 22]\nInput 4: [40, 80, 81, 87, 20]\nOutput 4: [40, 80, 81, 87, 20]\n\n\nInput: [77, 73, 14]\nOutput:\n",
