    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [2, 20, 26, 34, 34, 66, 80, 97]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The sequence is mostly increasing, with a repeated number (34).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [77, 66, 26, 8]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The sequence is strictly decreasing.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [4, 47, 59, 65, 68, 89]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [83, 45, 45, 22, 5]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The sequence is mostly decreasing, with a repeated number (45).\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the output is [1] if the sequence is mostly increasing or strictly increasing, and [0] if the sequence is mostly decreasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input:** [50, 75, 83]\n- Observation: The sequence is strictly increasing.\n\nBased on the rule, the output should be [1] for a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
