    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [52, 66, 47, 18, 62, 4] → Output 1: [53, 66, 47, 18, 62, 5]\n2. Input 2: [41, 82, 70, 33, 81] → Output 2: [42, 82, 70, 33, 82]\n3. Input 3: [9, 100, 15, 4, 38, 98, 48] → Output 3: [10, 100, 15, 4, 38, 98, 49]\n4. Input 4: [92, 83, 57, 22] → Output 4: [93, 83, 57, 23]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n- The first and last elements of the input list are incremented by 1 in the output list.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input: [67, 46, 61, 42, 64, 42, 68, 45, 53].\n\n- Increment the first element (67) by 1 to get 68.\n- Increment the last element (53) by 1 to get 54.\n- Keep all other elements unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the output will be: <<<[68, 46, 61, 42, 64, 42, 68, 45, 54]>>>"
