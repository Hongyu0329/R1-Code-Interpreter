  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [34, 50, 4, 25, 29, 51]\nOutput 1: [6]\nInput 2: [83, 33, 87]\nOutput 2: [3]\nInput 3: [91, 23, 4, 38, 87, 10, 47, 2]\nOutput 3: [8]\nInput 4: [55, 45, 55, 97]\nOutput 4: [4]\n\n\nInput: [51, 66, 75, 39]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [34, 50, 4, 25, 29, 51] → Output: [6]\n2. Input: [83, 33, 87] → Output: [3]\n3. Input: [91, 23, 4, 38, 87, 10, 47, 2] → Output: [8]\n4. Input: [55, 45, 55, 97] → Output: [4]\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is the count of numbers in the input list. Let's verify this hypothesis:\n\n- For Input 1, there are 6 numbers, and the output is 6.\n- For Input 2, there are 3 numbers, and the output is 3.\n- For Input 3, there are 8 numbers, and the output is 8.\n- For Input 4, there are 4 numbers, and the output is 4.\n\nThe rule appears to be that the output is the count of elements in the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [51, 66, 75, 39]\n\nThere are 4 elements in this list. Therefore, the output should be:\n\n<<<[4]>>>"
