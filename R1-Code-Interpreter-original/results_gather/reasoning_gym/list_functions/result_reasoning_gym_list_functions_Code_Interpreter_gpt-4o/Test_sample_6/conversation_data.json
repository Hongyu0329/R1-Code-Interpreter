    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [55, 97, 93, 14, 9, 47, 90, 60, 48] → Output 1: [93]\n2. Input 2: [78, 86, 22] → Output 2: [22]\n3. Input 3: [42, 35, 91, 43, 80, 94, 40, 61] → Output 3: [91]\n4. Input 4: [29, 79, 11, 68, 63, 19, 56, 68, 32] → Output 4: [11]\n\nObservations:\n- The output is a single number from the input list.\n- The output number is the largest prime number in the input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input: [49, 48, 93].\n\nFirst, we need to identify the prime numbers in the list and then select the largest one. Let's do this calculation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\n# Input list\ninput_list = [49, 48, 93]\n\n# Find prime numbers in the list\nprime_numbers = [num for num in input_list if isprime(num)]\n\n# Select the largest prime number\nlargest_prime = max(prime_numbers) if prime_numbers else None\nlargest_prime\nassistant > It seems that there are no prime numbers in the input list [49, 48, 93]. Therefore, according to the rule, if there are no prime numbers, the output should be an empty list.\n\nThus, the output is: <<<[]>>>"
