    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [3, 20, 21, 44, 50, 58, 62, 69, 72, 87]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The list contains both even and odd numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [93, 41, 37]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: All numbers in the list are odd.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [10, 17, 28, 29, 40, 66, 78, 88]\n   - Output: [1]\n   - Observation: The list contains both even and odd numbers.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [100, 92, 75, 72, 43, 24, 24]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The list contains both even and odd numbers.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the output is [1] if the list contains both even and odd numbers, and [0] if the list contains only odd numbers. However, Example 4 contradicts this rule, as it contains both even and odd numbers but results in [0]. \n\nLet's refine the rule: \n- If the list contains more even numbers than odd numbers, the output is [1].\n- If the list contains more odd numbers than even numbers, the output is [0].\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- **Input:** [3, 30, 32, 58, 58, 72, 84, 90, 99]\n  - Even numbers: 30, 32, 58, 58, 72, 84, 90 (7 even numbers)\n  - Odd numbers: 3, 99 (2 odd numbers)\n\nSince there are more even numbers than odd numbers, the output should be [1].\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
