  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [80, 75, 99, 94, 85, 55]\nOutput 1: [6]\nInput 2: [98, 40, 18, 55, 70, 97, 16, 33, 38, 77]\nOutput 2: [10]\nInput 3: [91, 85, 36]\nOutput 3: [3]\nInput 4: [25, 24, 76, 25, 20, 95, 69, 18]\nOutput 4: [8]\n\n\nInput: [48, 15, 10, 21, 9, 64]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n- **Example 1**: Input: [80, 75, 99, 94, 85, 55] → Output: [6]\n- **Example 2**: Input: [98, 40, 18, 55, 70, 97, 16, 33, 38, 77] → Output: [10]\n- **Example 3**: Input: [91, 85, 36] → Output: [3]\n- **Example 4**: Input: [25, 24, 76, 25, 20, 95, 69, 18] → Output: [8]\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the output is simply the count of elements in the input list. Let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [48, 15, 10, 21, 9, 64]\n\nThe number of elements in this list is 6. Therefore, the output should be:\n\n<<<[6]>>>"
