Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [835]\nOutput 1: [0]\nInput 2: [320]\nOutput 2: [1]\nInput 3: [2165]\nOutput 3: [0]\nInput 4: [650]\nOutput 4: [1]\n\n\nInput: [1715]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [835] → Output: [0]\n2. Input: [320] → Output: [1]\n3. Input: [2165] → Output: [0]\n4. Input: [650] → Output: [1]\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is determined by some property of the input number. Let's explore possible rules:\n\n- Check if the number is even or odd.\n- Check if the number is divisible by a certain number.\n- Check the sum of the digits.\n- Check the last digit of the number.\n\nLet's analyze these possibilities:\n\n1. **Even or Odd**: \n   - 835 is odd → Output: 0\n   - 320 is even → Output: 1\n   - 2165 is odd → Output: 0\n   - 650 is even → Output: 1\n\nIt seems that the output is 0 for odd numbers and 1 for even numbers. Let's apply this rule to the input [1715]:\n\n- 1715 is odd.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [1715] should be:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
