    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: 84 → Output: 164\n2. Input: 48 → Output: 92\n3. Input: 98 → Output: 192\n4. Input: 88 → Output: 172\n\nLet's calculate the difference between each input and output:\n\n1. 164 - 84 = 80\n2. 92 - 48 = 44\n3. 192 - 98 = 94\n4. 172 - 88 = 84\n\nThe differences are 80, 44, 94, and 84, respectively. It seems that the output is obtained by adding a certain value to the input. Let's check if there's a pattern or rule in these differences.\n\nThe differences don't follow a simple arithmetic pattern, so let's check if there's a consistent rule or formula that can be applied to the input to get the output.\n\nOne possible approach is to check if the output is approximately double the input, as the differences are relatively large. Let's calculate the ratio of output to input for each example:\n\n1. 164 / 84 ≈ 1.952\n2. 92 / 48 ≈ 1.917\n3. 192 / 98 ≈ 1.959\n4. 172 / 88 ≈ 1.955\n\nThe ratios are close to 2, suggesting that the output might be approximately double the input. Let's test this hypothesis by calculating the output for the given input [72] using this rule.\n\nOutput = Input * 2 - Adjustment\n\nLet's calculate the output for the input [72] using this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the output for the input [72] using the approximate doubling rule\ninput_value = 72\napprox_ratio = 1.95  # Approximate ratio based on previous examples\n\n# Calculate the output\noutput_value = round(input_value * approx_ratio)\noutput_value\nassistant > Using the approximate doubling rule, the output for the input [72] is calculated to be 140. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[140]>>>"
