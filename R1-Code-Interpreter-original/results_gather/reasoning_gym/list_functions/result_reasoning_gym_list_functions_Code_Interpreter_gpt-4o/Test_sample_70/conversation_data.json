  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [87, 79, 46, 22, 71]\nOutput 1: [22]\nInput 2: [50, 38, 80, 55, 73]\nOutput 2: [0]\nInput 3: [93, 68, 70]\nOutput 3: [0]\nInput 4: [95, 49, 57, 30, 66]\nOutput 4: [0]\n\n\nInput: [11, 7, 89, 24, 78]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [87, 79, 46, 22, 71] → Output: [22]\n2. Input: [50, 38, 80, 55, 73] → Output: [0]\n3. Input: [93, 68, 70] → Output: [0]\n4. Input: [95, 49, 57, 30, 66] → Output: [0]\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that the output is either a single number from the input list or 0. Let's try to identify a pattern:\n\n- In the first example, the output is 22, which is the smallest number in the input list.\n- In the other examples, the output is 0, which suggests that there might be a condition under which the output is 0 instead of the smallest number.\n\nA possible rule could be:\n- If the smallest number in the list is even, output that number.\n- If the smallest number in the list is odd, output 0.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input: [11, 7, 89, 24, 78].\n\n1. Find the smallest number: 7\n2. Check if it is even or odd: 7 is odd.\n\nAccording to the rule, if the smallest number is odd, the output should be 0.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [11, 7, 89, 24, 78] is:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
