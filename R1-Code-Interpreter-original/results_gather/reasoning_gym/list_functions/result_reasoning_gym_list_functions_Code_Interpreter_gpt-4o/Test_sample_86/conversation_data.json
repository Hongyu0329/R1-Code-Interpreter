Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [13, 38, 40, 47, 90]\nOutput 1: [1]\nInput 2: [43, 39, 4]\nOutput 2: [0]\nInput 3: [19, 44, 66, 66, 67, 73, 75, 78, 88, 93]\nOutput 3: [1]\nInput 4: [73, 27, 17]\nOutput 4: [0]\n\n\nInput: [8, 9, 37, 43, 47, 72, 80, 83, 97]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Input: [13, 38, 40, 47, 90] → Output: [1]\n2. **Example 2**: Input: [43, 39, 4] → Output: [0]\n3. **Example 3**: Input: [19, 44, 66, 66, 67, 73, 75, 78, 88, 93] → Output: [1]\n4. **Example 4**: Input: [73, 27, 17] → Output: [0]\n\nObservations:\n- The output is either [1] or [0].\n- The output [1] seems to be associated with inputs that contain at least one even number.\n- The output [0] seems to be associated with inputs that contain only odd numbers.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [8, 9, 37, 43, 47, 72, 80, 83, 97]\n\nThis input contains the even numbers 8, 72, and 80. Therefore, according to the observed rule, the output should be [1].\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
