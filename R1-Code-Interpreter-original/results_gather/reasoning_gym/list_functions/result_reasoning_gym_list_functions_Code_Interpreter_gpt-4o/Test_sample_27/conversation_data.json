Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [11, 84, 59, 3, 18, 39]\nOutput 1: [11, 84, 59, 3, 18, 39]\nInput 2: [88, 80, 2]\nOutput 2: [88, 80, 2]\nInput 3: [49, 63, 69, 39, 98, 21, 94, 75, 44, 86]\nOutput 3: [49, 63, 69, 39, 98, 21, 94, 75, 44, 86]\nInput 4: [68, 15, 13, 48, 83]\nOutput 4: [68, 15, 13, 48, 83]\n\n\nInput: [41, 40, 12]\nOutput:\n",
