Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [13, 22, 9]\nOutput 1: [44]\nInput 2: [42, 71, 54, 60, 55, 73, 57, 67]\nOutput 2: [479]\nInput 3: [72, 71, 57, 19, 53, 51, 9, 54]\nOutput 3: [386]\nInput 4: [19, 26, 19, 40, 28, 89, 85]\nOutput 4: [306]\n\n\nInput: [14, 13, 50, 80, 94, 9]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [13, 22, 9] → Output: [44]\n2. Input: [42, 71, 54, 60, 55, 73, 57, 67] → Output: [479]\n3. Input: [72, 71, 57, 19, 53, 51, 9, 54] → Output: [386]\n4. Input: [19, 26, 19, 40, 28, 89, 85] → Output: [306]\n\nThe outputs appear to be the sum of the input numbers. Let's verify this hypothesis:\n\n- For Input 1: 13 + 22 + 9 = 44\n- For Input 2: 42 + 71 + 54 + 60 + 55 + 73 + 57 + 67 = 479\n- For Input 3: 72 + 71 + 57 + 19 + 53 + 51 + 9 + 54 = 386\n- For Input 4: 19 + 26 + 19 + 40 + 28 + 89 + 85 = 306\n\nThe rule seems to be that the output is the sum of the input list. Let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [14, 13, 50, 80, 94, 9]\n\nLet's calculate the sum.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the sum of the input list\ninput_list = [14, 13, 50, 80, 94, 9]\noutput = sum(input_list)\noutput\nassistant > The sum of the input list [14, 13, 50, 80, 94, 9] is 260. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[260]>>>"
