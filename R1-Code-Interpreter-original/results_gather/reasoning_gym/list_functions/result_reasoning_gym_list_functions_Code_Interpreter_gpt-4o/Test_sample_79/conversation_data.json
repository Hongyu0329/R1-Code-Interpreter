    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [41, 64, 25, 51, 54, 79] → Output 1: [79, 54, 51, 25, 64, 41]\n2. Input 2: [81, 25, 90, 54, 72] → Output 2: [72, 54, 90, 25, 81]\n3. Input 3: [24, 86, 60, 54, 50, 92] → Output 3: [92, 50, 54, 60, 86, 24]\n4. Input 4: [49, 29, 92, 93, 99, 45, 64] → Output 4: [64, 45, 99, 93, 92, 29, 49]\n\nObservations:\n- The output is a rearrangement of the input list.\n- The output list appears to be a combination of reversing the input list and then rearranging the elements in a specific order.\n\nLet's break down the pattern:\n- The first element of the output is the largest element from the input.\n- The second element of the output is the smallest element from the input.\n- The third element of the output is the second largest element from the input.\n- The fourth element of the output is the second smallest element from the input.\n- This pattern continues, alternating between the largest remaining and smallest remaining elements.\n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to the new input: [41, 87, 98].\n\n1. Largest element: 98\n2. Smallest element: 41\n3. Second largest element: 87\n\nThus, the output for the input [41, 87, 98] is:\n\n<<<[98, 41, 87]>>>"
