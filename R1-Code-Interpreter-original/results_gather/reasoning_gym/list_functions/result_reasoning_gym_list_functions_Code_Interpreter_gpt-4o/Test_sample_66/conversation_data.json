    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [845] → Output: [0]\n2. Input: [460] → Output: [1]\n3. Input: [3955] → Output: [0]\n4. Input: [740] → Output: [1]\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is determined by some property of the input number. Let's explore possible rules:\n\n- Check if the number is even or odd.\n- Check if the number is divisible by a specific number.\n- Check the sum of the digits.\n- Check the last digit of the number.\n\nLet's analyze these possibilities:\n\n1. **Even or Odd**: \n   - 845 is odd → 0\n   - 460 is even → 1\n   - 3955 is odd → 0\n   - 740 is even → 1\n\n2. **Divisibility**:\n   - 845 is not divisible by 2 → 0\n   - 460 is divisible by 2 → 1\n   - 3955 is not divisible by 2 → 0\n   - 740 is divisible by 2 → 1\n\n3. **Sum of Digits**:\n   - Sum of digits of 845 = 17 (odd) → 0\n   - Sum of digits of 460 = 10 (even) → 1\n   - Sum of digits of 3955 = 22 (even) → 0\n   - Sum of digits of 740 = 11 (odd) → 1\n\n4. **Last Digit**:\n   - Last digit of 845 = 5 (odd) → 0\n   - Last digit of 460 = 0 (even) → 1\n   - Last digit of 3955 = 5 (odd) → 0\n   - Last digit of 740 = 0 (even) → 1\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems that the output is determined by whether the last digit of the number is even or odd. If the last digit is even, the output is 1; if the last digit is odd, the output is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the input [4105]:\n\n- Last digit of 4105 = 5 (odd) → 0\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [4105] is:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
