    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: 52 → Output: 100\n2. Input: 73 → Output: 142\n3. Input: 21 → Output: 38\n4. Input: 91 → Output: 178\n\nLet's calculate the difference between each input and output:\n\n1. 100 - 52 = 48\n2. 142 - 73 = 69\n3. 38 - 21 = 17\n4. 178 - 91 = 87\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio of the output to the input:\n\n1. 100 / 52 ≈ 1.923\n2. 142 / 73 ≈ 1.945\n3. 38 / 21 ≈ 1.810\n4. 178 / 91 ≈ 1.956\n\nThe differences and ratios do not seem to follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern. Let's try another approach by examining the relationship between the input and output more closely.\n\nLet's check if the output is approximately double the input:\n\n1. 52 * 2 = 104 (close to 100)\n2. 73 * 2 = 146 (close to 142)\n3. 21 * 2 = 42 (close to 38)\n4. 91 * 2 = 182 (close to 178)\n\nThe outputs are approximately double the inputs, but slightly less. Let's calculate the exact relationship:\n\n1. 100 = 52 * 2 - 4\n2. 142 = 73 * 2 - 4\n3. 38 = 21 * 2 - 4\n4. 178 = 91 * 2 - 4\n\nThe rule seems to be: Output = Input * 2 - 4\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: 11\n\nOutput = 11 * 2 - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [11] is:\n\n<<<[18]>>>"
