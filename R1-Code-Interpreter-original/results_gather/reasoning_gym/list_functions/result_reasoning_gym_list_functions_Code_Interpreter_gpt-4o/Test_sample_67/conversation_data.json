  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [49, 26, 77, 23, 30, 32, 18, 98, 12]\nOutput 1: [12, 18, 23, 26, 30, 32, 49, 77, 98]\nInput 2: [94, 50, 68, 88, 90, 69, 12]\nOutput 2: [12, 50, 68, 69, 88, 90, 94]\nInput 3: [26, 54, 93, 79, 76, 28, 48, 50, 88, 28]\nOutput 3: [26, 28, 28, 48, 50, 54, 76, 79, 88, 93]\nInput 4: [60, 85, 23, 73, 44]\nOutput 4: [23, 44, 60, 73, 85]\n\n\nInput: [92, 68, 87, 100]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > The rule applied in the examples is sorting the list of numbers in ascending order. Applying the same rule to the input list [92, 68, 87, 100], the sorted list is [68, 87, 92, 100].\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[68, 87, 92, 100]>>>"
