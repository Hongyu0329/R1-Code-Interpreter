  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [45, 53, 15, 42]\nOutput 1: [46, 53, 15, 43]\nInput 2: [88, 6, 98]\nOutput 2: [89, 6, 99]\nInput 3: [20, 59, 94, 6, 81, 70, 65]\nOutput 3: [21, 59, 94, 6, 81, 70, 66]\nInput 4: [78, 37, 74, 48, 52, 4]\nOutput 4: [79, 37, 74, 48, 52, 5]\n\n\nInput: [93, 18, 13, 55, 94, 49]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. In Input 1, the first and last elements are incremented by 1.\n2. In Input 2, the first and last elements are incremented by 1.\n3. In Input 3, the first and last elements are incremented by 1.\n4. In Input 4, the first and last elements are incremented by 1.\n\nThe rule appears to be that the first and last elements of the list are incremented by 1, while the other elements remain unchanged.\n\nApplying this rule to the input [93, 18, 13, 55, 94, 49]:\n\n- Increment the first element (93) by 1 to get 94.\n- Increment the last element (49) by 1 to get 50.\n- The other elements remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the output is [94, 18, 13, 55, 94, 50].\n\nThe final output is:\n\n<<<[94, 18, 13, 55, 94, 50]>>>"
