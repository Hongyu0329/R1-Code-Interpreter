    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's examine the examples provided:\n\n1. Input 1: 93 → Output 1: 182\n2. Input 2: 53 → Output 2: 102\n3. Input 3: 70 → Output 3: 136\n4. Input 4: 22 → Output 4: 40\n\nLet's calculate the differences between the input and output values:\n\n1. 182 - 93 = 89\n2. 102 - 53 = 49\n3. 136 - 70 = 66\n4. 40 - 22 = 18\n\nNow, let's see if there's a pattern in these differences:\n\n- 89 is approximately 93 * 0.95\n- 49 is approximately 53 * 0.92\n- 66 is approximately 70 * 0.94\n- 18 is approximately 22 * 0.82\n\nThe differences don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern. Let's try another approach by examining the ratio of output to input:\n\n1. 182 / 93 ≈ 1.957\n2. 102 / 53 ≈ 1.924\n3. 136 / 70 ≈ 1.943\n4. 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818\n\nThe ratios are close to 2, suggesting a possible pattern of multiplying the input by a factor close to 2. Let's calculate the average of these ratios to determine a consistent factor:\n\nAverage ratio = (1.957 + 1.924 + 1.943 + 1.818) / 4\n\nLet's calculate this average ratio and apply it to the input 80 to find the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the average ratio\nratios = [1.957, 1.924, 1.943, 1.818]\naverage_ratio = sum(ratios) / len(ratios)\n\n# Apply the average ratio to the input 80\ninput_value = 80\noutput_value = input_value * average_ratio\noutput_value\nassistant > The average ratio of the outputs to the inputs is approximately 1.928. Applying this ratio to the input 80 gives us an output of approximately 152.84. Therefore, the output corresponding to the input [80] is:\n\n<<<[153]>>>"
