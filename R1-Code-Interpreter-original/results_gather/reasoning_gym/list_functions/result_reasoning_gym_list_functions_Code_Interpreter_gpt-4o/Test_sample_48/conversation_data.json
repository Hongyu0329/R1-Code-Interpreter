    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [51, 70, 91, 54, 48, 47, 69] → Output 1: [7]\n2. Input 2: [48, 4, 71, 98, 50, 29, 80, 7, 50] → Output 2: [9]\n3. Input 3: [22, 68, 73, 2, 19, 58] → Output 3: [6]\n4. Input 4: [21, 30, 48, 46, 76] → Output 4: [5]\n\nThe outputs seem to be related to the number of elements in each input list. Let's verify this hypothesis:\n\n- For Input 1, the list has 7 elements, and the output is [7].\n- For Input 2, the list has 9 elements, and the output is [9].\n- For Input 3, the list has 6 elements, and the output is [6].\n- For Input 4, the list has 5 elements, and the output is [5].\n\nThe rule appears to be that the output is a list containing the number of elements in the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [81, 27, 35, 34, 11]\n\nThe input list has 5 elements. Therefore, the output should be:\n\n<<<[5]>>>"
