    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the given inputs to their respective outputs, let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Input: [1895] → Output: [0]\n2. Input: [50] → Output: [1]\n3. Input: [1135] → Output: [0]\n4. Input: [370] → Output: [1]\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output is determined by whether the input number is divisible by a certain number. Let's check if the input numbers are divisible by 5:\n\n- 1895 is divisible by 5 (1895 ÷ 5 = 379), and the output is 0.\n- 50 is divisible by 5 (50 ÷ 5 = 10), and the output is 1.\n- 1135 is divisible by 5 (1135 ÷ 5 = 227), and the output is 0.\n- 370 is divisible by 5 (370 ÷ 5 = 74), and the output is 1.\n\nSince all numbers are divisible by 5, let's check if the output is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the quotient when divided by 5:\n\n- 1895 ÷ 5 = 379 (odd) → Output: 0\n- 50 ÷ 5 = 10 (even) → Output: 1\n- 1135 ÷ 5 = 227 (odd) → Output: 0\n- 370 ÷ 5 = 74 (even) → Output: 1\n\nThe output seems to be 0 if the quotient is odd and 1 if the quotient is even.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the input [2265]:\n\n- 2265 ÷ 5 = 453 (odd)\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [2265] should be 0.\n\nThe output is: <<<[0]>>>"
