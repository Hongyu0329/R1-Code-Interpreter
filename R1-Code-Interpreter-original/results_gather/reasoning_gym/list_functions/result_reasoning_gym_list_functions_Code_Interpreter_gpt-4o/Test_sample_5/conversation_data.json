    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input 1: [80, 86, 96, 82] → Output 1: [81, 86, 96, 83]\n2. Input 2: [81, 48, 57] → Output 2: [82, 48, 58]\n3. Input 3: [88, 59, 77, 37] → Output 3: [89, 59, 77, 38]\n4. Input 4: [95, 55, 57, 19, 7, 12, 53, 10, 70] → Output 4: [96, 55, 57, 19, 7, 12, 53, 10, 71]\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n- The first and the last elements of the list are incremented by 1.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [47, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 47]\n\nFollowing the pattern:\n- Increment the first element (47) by 1 to get 48.\n- Increment the last element (47) by 1 to get 48.\n- Keep all other elements unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the output will be:\n\n<<<[48, 83, 91, 56, 76, 73, 48]>>>"
