  "question": "You are an expert at inductive reasoning. Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [99, 63, 65, 38, 1]\nOutput 1: [63]\nInput 2: [21, 98, 5, 56, 61, 75, 1]\nOutput 2: [98]\nInput 3: [72, 18, 16, 62, 11, 81, 6]\nOutput 3: [6]\nInput 4: [99, 63, 12, 63, 24, 1, 31, 4]\nOutput 4: [24]\n\n\nInput: [69, 48, 2]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [99, 63, 65, 38, 1] → Output: [63]\n2. Input: [21, 98, 5, 56, 61, 75, 1] → Output: [98]\n3. Input: [72, 18, 16, 62, 11, 81, 6] → Output: [6]\n4. Input: [99, 63, 12, 63, 24, 1, 31, 4] → Output: [24]\n\nObservations:\n- In each example, the output is a single number from the input list.\n- The output number is the smallest even number in the input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input: [69, 48, 2].\n\nThe even numbers in the list are 48 and 2. The smallest even number is 2.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [69, 48, 2] is:\n\n<<<[2]>>>"
