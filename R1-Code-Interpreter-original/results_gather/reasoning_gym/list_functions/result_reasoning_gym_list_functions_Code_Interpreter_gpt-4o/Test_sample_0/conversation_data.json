Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [28, 19, 39, 90]\nOutput 1: [39]\nInput 2: [64, 4, 93, 5, 13, 42]\nOutput 2: [93]\nInput 3: [8, 67, 89, 61, 48, 77, 1, 70]\nOutput 3: [89]\nInput 4: [68, 2, 63, 94, 99]\nOutput 4: [63]\n\n\nInput: [37, 26, 58, 11, 43, 16]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n- In each example, the output is a single number from the input list.\n- The number selected in the output is the largest prime number from the input list.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [37, 26, 58, 11, 43, 16]\n\nFirst, identify the prime numbers in the list: 37, 11, and 43. Among these, 43 is the largest prime number.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input is:\n\n<<<[43]>>>"
