    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: 95 → Output: 186\n2. Input: 28 → Output: 52\n3. Input: 98 → Output: 192\n\nLet's try to identify a pattern or rule that applies to these transformations. One possible approach is to examine the difference between the input and output values:\n\n1. 186 - 95 = 91\n2. 52 - 28 = 24\n3. 192 - 98 = 94\n\nThe differences are 91, 24, and 94, respectively. Let's see if there's a consistent pattern or rule that can be applied to these differences.\n\nNotice that the differences are close to the input values themselves. Let's check if the output is approximately double the input:\n\n1. 95 * 2 = 190 (close to 186)\n2. 28 * 2 = 56 (close to 52)\n3. 98 * 2 = 196 (close to 192)\n\nIt seems that the output is approximately double the input, but slightly less. Let's calculate the exact difference:\n\n1. 186 = 95 * 2 - 4\n2. 52 = 28 * 2 - 4\n3. 192 = 98 * 2 - 4\n\nThe rule appears to be: Output = (Input * 2) - 4\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: 20\n\nOutput = (20 * 2) - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [20] is:\n\n<<<[36]>>>"
