    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: 25 → Output: 46\n2. Input: 29 → Output: 54\n3. Input: 17 → Output: 30\n4. Input: 58 → Output: 112\n\nLet's calculate the differences between the input and output values:\n\n1. 46 - 25 = 21\n2. 54 - 29 = 25\n3. 30 - 17 = 13\n4. 112 - 58 = 54\n\nThe differences are 21, 25, 13, and 54. These differences do not follow a simple arithmetic pattern, so let's try another approach. Let's check if the output is a multiple of the input:\n\n1. 46 / 25 ≈ 1.84\n2. 54 / 29 ≈ 1.86\n3. 30 / 17 ≈ 1.76\n4. 112 / 58 ≈ 1.93\n\nThe ratios are approximately 1.84, 1.86, 1.76, and 1.93. These ratios are close to 2, but not exactly. Let's try another approach by examining the relationship between the input and output more closely.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern or rule that can be applied to the input to get the output. One possible approach is to consider a linear transformation of the form:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = a \\times \\text{Input} + b \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) using the given examples.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\na, b = symbols('a b')\n\n# Define the equations based on the examples\neq1 = Eq(a * 25 + b, 46)\neq2 = Eq(a * 29 + b, 54)\neq3 = Eq(a * 17 + b, 30)\neq4 = Eq(a * 58 + b, 112)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4), (a, b))\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of equations suggests that the rule mapping the input to the output is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times \\text{Input} - 4 \\]\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given input [1]:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = 2 \\times 1 - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [1] is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Output} = [-2] \\]\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<<<[-2]>>>"
