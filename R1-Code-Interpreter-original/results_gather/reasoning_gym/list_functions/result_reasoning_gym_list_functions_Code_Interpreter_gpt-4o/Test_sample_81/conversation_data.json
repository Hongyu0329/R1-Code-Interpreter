Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [84, 93, 36]\nOutput 1: [84, 93, 36]\nInput 2: [62, 71, 45]\nOutput 2: [62, 71, 45]\nInput 3: [56, 4, 9, 39, 17, 77]\nOutput 3: [56, 4, 9, 39, 17, 77]\nInput 4: [64, 37, 39, 56, 44, 51, 25]\nOutput 4: [64, 37, 39, 56, 44, 51, 25]\n\n\nInput: [50, 40, 94, 5, 67, 46, 23, 80, 98, 29]\nOutput:\n",
