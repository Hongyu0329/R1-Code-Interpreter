    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. In each example, the output is double the last element of the input list.\n2. For Input 1: [75, 150, 300, 600], the last element is 600, and the output is 1200, which is 600 * 2.\n3. For Input 2: [43, 86, 172, 344, 688], the last element is 688, and the output is 1376, which is 688 * 2.\n4. For Input 3: [61, 122, 244, 488, 976, 1952, 3904, 7808, 15616], the last element is 15616, and the output is 31232, which is 15616 * 2.\n5. For Input 4: [68, 136, 272, 544, 1088, 2176, 4352, 8704], the last element is 8704, and the output is 17408, which is 8704 * 2.\n\nApplying the same rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [42, 84, 168, 336, 672]\n\nThe last element is 672. Therefore, the output should be 672 * 2 = 1344.\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<<<[1344]>>>"
