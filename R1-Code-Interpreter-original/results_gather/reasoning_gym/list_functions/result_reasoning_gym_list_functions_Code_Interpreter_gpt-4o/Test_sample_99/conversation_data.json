    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [3, 12, 37, 48, 50, 51, 66, 99]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [77, 73, 45, 13]\n   - Output: [0]\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [29, 71, 88, 89, 90]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [96, 94, 93, 70, 63, 58, 29, 26, 22, 7]\n   - Output: [0]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to be either [1] or [0].\n- The output [1] appears when there is at least one number in the input list that is a perfect square.\n- The output [0] appears when there are no perfect squares in the input list.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis by checking if there is a perfect square in the new input list [2, 9, 56, 83, 95, 95].\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Function to check if a number is a perfect square\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    return math.isqrt(n) ** 2 == n\n\n# Input list\ninput_list = [2, 9, 56, 83, 95, 95]\n\n# Check if there is any perfect square in the input list\noutput = [1] if any(is_perfect_square(num) for num in input_list) else [0]\noutput\nassistant > The input list [2, 9, 56, 83, 95, 95] contains the number 9, which is a perfect square. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[1]>>>"
