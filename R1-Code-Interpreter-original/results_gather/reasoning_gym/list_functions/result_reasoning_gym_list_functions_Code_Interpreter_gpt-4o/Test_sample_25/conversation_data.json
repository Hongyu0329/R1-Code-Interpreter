Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [48, 76, 78]\nOutput 1: [78]\nInput 2: [29, 66, 42]\nOutput 2: [42]\nInput 3: [38, 56, 82, 49, 3, 95, 22, 67, 78, 48]\nOutput 3: [82]\nInput 4: [51, 14, 84, 93, 75, 88, 63, 70, 33]\nOutput 4: [84]\n\n\nInput: [73, 19, 18, 49, 72]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n- In each example, the output is a single number from the input list.\n- The number selected in the output is the largest even number from the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [73, 19, 18, 49, 72]\n\n- The even numbers in the list are 18 and 72.\n- The largest even number is 72.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input should be:\n\n<<<[72]>>>"
