    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [15, 53, 60, 99]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [83, 80, 77, 63, 55, 36, 35, 27, 6]\n   - Output: [0]\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [5, 21, 24, 37, 57]\n   - Output: [1]\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [88, 63, 40, 13]\n   - Output: [0]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to be either 0 or 1.\n- The output might be related to the presence of a certain property in the numbers of the input list.\n\nLet's explore a possible rule:\n- Check if there is a common property among the numbers in the input list that results in a specific output.\n\nOne possible rule could be related to the parity (odd or even) of the numbers:\n- If the majority of numbers in the list are odd, the output is [1].\n- If the majority of numbers in the list are even, the output is [0].\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given input: [2, 51, 52, 76, 84, 96].\n\nCount the odd and even numbers in the list:\n- Odd numbers: 51\n- Even numbers: 2, 52, 76, 84, 96\n\nSince there are more even numbers than odd numbers, the output should be [0].\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [2, 51, 52, 76, 84, 96] is:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
