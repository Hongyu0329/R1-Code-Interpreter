    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [92, 12, 62, 85, 74, 76]\n   - Output: [12]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the input list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [82, 46, 58, 74, 40, 34, 63]\n   - Output: [0]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the input list minus 34 (34 - 34 = 0).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [48, 10, 70, 94, 19, 6, 87]\n   - Output: [35]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the input list minus 6 (6 - 6 = 0), then add 35.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [48, 59, 14, 17, 70, 99, 68, 24, 7]\n   - Output: [62]\n   - Observation: The output is the smallest number in the input list minus 7 (7 - 7 = 0), then add 62.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems the rule involves finding the smallest number in the list, subtracting it from itself to get 0, and then adding a specific number to get the output. The specific number added seems to be related to the smallest number in the list.\n\nLet's apply this reasoning to the new input:\n\n- Input: [4, 16, 65, 37]\n- The smallest number is 4.\n- Subtract 4 from itself to get 0.\n- Add 4 to get the output.\n\nTherefore, the output for the input [4, 16, 65, 37] is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
