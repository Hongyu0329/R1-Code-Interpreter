In each example, the sequence is a geometric progression where each term is double the previous term.\n2. The output is the next term in the sequence, which is also double the last term of the input sequence.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given input:\n\n- The last term in the input sequence is 50176.\n- The next term, which is the output, is double the last term.\n\nLet's calculate the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = [98, 196, 392, 784, 1568, 3136, 6272, 12544, 25088, 50176]\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = input_sequence[-1] * 2\nnext_term\nassistant > The next term in the sequence, and thus the output, is 100352.
