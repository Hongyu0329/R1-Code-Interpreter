    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [9, 31, 60, 40, 86]\n   - Output: [9, 32, 62, 43, 90]\n   - Observations: \n     - 31 → 32 (+1)\n     - 60 → 62 (+2)\n     - 40 → 43 (+3)\n     - 86 → 90 (+4)\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [22, 66, 24, 21, 1, 34, 82, 22]\n   - Output: [22, 67, 26, 24, 5, 39, 88, 29]\n   - Observations:\n     - 66 → 67 (+1)\n     - 24 → 26 (+2)\n     - 21 → 24 (+3)\n     - 1 → 5 (+4)\n     - 34 → 39 (+5)\n     - 82 → 88 (+6)\n     - 22 → 29 (+7)\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [4, 61, 61, 67]\n   - Output: [4, 62, 63, 70]\n   - Observations:\n     - 61 → 62 (+1)\n     - 61 → 63 (+2)\n     - 67 → 70 (+3)\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [100, 44, 76]\n   - Output: [100, 45, 78]\n   - Observations:\n     - 44 → 45 (+1)\n     - 76 → 78 (+2)\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the transformation rule involves incrementing each element by an increasing sequence of integers starting from 0. The first element remains unchanged, the second element is incremented by 1, the third by 2, and so on.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- Input: [89, 28, 92, 11, 42]\n\nApplying the rule:\n- 89 → 89 (+0)\n- 28 → 29 (+1)\n- 92 → 94 (+2)\n- 11 → 14 (+3)\n- 42 → 46 (+4)\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<<<[89, 29, 94, 14, 46]>>>"
