    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [70, 46, 60, 7, 85, 65]\n   - Output: [6]\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [78, 29, 37, 63, 89, 28]\n   - Output: [6]\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [57, 10, 33, 25, 21, 12, 57, 99]\n   - Output: [8]\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [25, 61, 42, 31, 82, 52, 55, 27]\n   - Output: [8]\n\nObservations:\n- The output seems to be related to the number of elements in the input list.\n- For inputs with 6 elements, the output is 6.\n- For inputs with 8 elements, the output is 8.\n\nBased on these observations, the rule appears to be that the output is the number of elements in the input list.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\n- Input: [56, 60, 39, 28]\n\nThis input has 4 elements. Therefore, the output should be:\n\n<<<[4]>>>"
