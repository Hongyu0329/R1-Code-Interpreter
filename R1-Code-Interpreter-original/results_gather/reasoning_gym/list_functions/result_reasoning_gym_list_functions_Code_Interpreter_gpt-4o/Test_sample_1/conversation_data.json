Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [81, 30, 36, 62, 84]\nOutput 1: [0]\nInput 2: [84, 79, 65, 42, 88]\nOutput 2: [0]\nInput 3: [57, 37, 87, 82, 10, 39, 53, 40, 67, 64]\nOutput 3: [10]\nInput 4: [96, 78, 95]\nOutput 4: [0]\n\n\nInput: [36, 41, 72, 98, 88, 32, 16, 8, 41]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Input: [81, 30, 36, 62, 84] → Output: [0]\n2. **Example 2**: Input: [84, 79, 65, 42, 88] → Output: [0]\n3. **Example 3**: Input: [57, 37, 87, 82, 10, 39, 53, 40, 67, 64] → Output: [10]\n4. **Example 4**: Input: [96, 78, 95] → Output: [0]\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that the output is [0] unless there is a specific number in the input list that matches a certain condition, in which case that number is the output. In Example 3, the number 10 is the output, suggesting that the rule might involve identifying a specific number or condition.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the rule involves identifying the smallest number in the list that is a multiple of 10. If no such number exists, the output is [0].\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input:\n\nInput: [36, 41, 72, 98, 88, 32, 16, 8, 41]\n\nWe'll check for the smallest number that is a multiple of 10. If none exists, the output will be [0]. Let's proceed with this check.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given input\ninput_list = [36, 41, 72, 98, 88, 32, 16, 8, 41]\n\n# Find the smallest number that is a multiple of 10\nmultiples_of_10 = [num for num in input_list if num % 10 == 0]\n\n# Determine the output based on the rule\noutput = [min(multiples_of_10)] if multiples_of_10 else [0]\noutput\nassistant > The output for the input [36, 41, 72, 98, 88, 32, 16, 8, 41] is determined to be [0] based on the rule. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[0]>>>"
