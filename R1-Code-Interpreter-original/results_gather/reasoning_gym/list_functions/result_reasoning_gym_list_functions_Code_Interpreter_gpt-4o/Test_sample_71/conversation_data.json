    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [93, 90, 95, 28, 89, 10, 78, 95, 16, 84]\n   Output: [93, 91, 97, 31, 93, 15, 84, 102, 24, 93]\n\n2. Input: [60, 44, 87, 16, 63, 11, 17, 29, 75]\n   Output: [60, 45, 89, 19, 67, 16, 23, 36, 83]\n\n3. Input: [6, 29, 14]\n   Output: [6, 30, 16]\n\n4. Input: [78, 67, 38, 24, 96]\n   Output: [78, 68, 40, 27, 100]\n\nBy examining these examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n- The first element remains unchanged.\n- Each subsequent element is increased by an incrementing value starting from 1. For example, the second element is increased by 1, the third by 2, the fourth by 3, and so on.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the new input: [94, 75, 93, 87, 54, 30, 85, 74, 99].\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the input list\ninput_list = [94, 75, 93, 87, 54, 30, 85, 74, 99]\n\n# Apply the rule: first element remains unchanged, subsequent elements are increased by an incrementing value\noutput_list = [input_list[0]] + [input_list[i] + i for i in range(1, len(input_list))]\n\noutput_list\nassistant > The output corresponding to the given input, following the identified pattern, is:\n\n<<<[94, 76, 95, 90, 58, 35, 91, 81, 107]>>>"
