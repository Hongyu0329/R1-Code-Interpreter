    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: [16, 81, 79, 52, 69, 88, 3, 27, 35, 91]\n   - Output: [79, 69]\n   - Observation: The numbers 79 and 69 are both prime numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: [90, 100, 84, 19, 11, 54]\n   - Output: [90, 100, 11]\n   - Observation: The numbers 90 and 100 are perfect squares (9^2 and 10^2), and 11 is a prime number.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: [26, 93, 4, 11, 52, 87, 1, 9, 23, 14]\n   - Output: [93, 11, 23]\n   - Observation: The numbers 93 and 23 are prime numbers, and 11 is a prime number.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: [76, 34, 29]\n   - Output: [76]\n   - Observation: The number 76 is a perfect square (8.7^2, approximately).\n\nFrom these observations, it seems the rule involves selecting numbers that are either prime or perfect squares. However, the rule might be more complex, as 76 is not a perfect square, but it is the largest number in the list.\n\nLet's apply this reasoning to the new input:\n\n- Input: [12, 4, 99, 59, 51, 28]\n\nNow, let's identify the numbers that are either prime or perfect squares, or follow the pattern observed in the examples.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the input list\ninput_list = [12, 4, 99, 59, 51, 28]\n\n# Function to check if a number is a perfect square\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    return int(n**0.5)**2 == n\n\n# Identify numbers that are either prime or perfect squares\noutput_list = [num for num in input_list if sympy.isprime(num) or is_perfect_square(num)]\n\noutput_list\nassistant > The numbers from the input list that are either prime or perfect squares are 4 and 59. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[4, 59]>>>"
