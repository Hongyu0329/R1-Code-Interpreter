Generate an output corresponding to the given input.\nThe output is generated by applying the same rule that maps input to output for the examples provided. Your answer should be a list of element/elements enclosed in triple angle brackets, like <<<list of element/elements>>>\nExamples:\nInput 1: [38, 90, 59, 58]\nOutput 1: [245]\nInput 2: [42, 14, 20, 87, 87]\nOutput 2: [250]\nInput 3: [92, 86, 53, 49, 31, 52]\nOutput 3: [363]\nInput 4: [65, 41, 99, 36]\nOutput 4: [241]\n\n\nInput: [100, 58, 13, 12, 5, 63, 45, 37, 18]\nOutput:\n",

    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input to the output, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. Input: [38, 90, 59, 58] → Output: [245]\n2. Input: [42, 14, 20, 87, 87] → Output: [250]\n3. Input: [92, 86, 53, 49, 31, 52] → Output: [363]\n4. Input: [65, 41, 99, 36] → Output: [241]\n\nThe outputs seem to be the sum of the input numbers. Let's verify this hypothesis:\n\n- For Input 1: 38 + 90 + 59 + 58 = 245\n- For Input 2: 42 + 14 + 20 + 87 + 87 = 250\n- For Input 3: 92 + 86 + 53 + 49 + 31 + 52 = 363\n- For Input 4: 65 + 41 + 99 + 36 = 241\n\nThe rule appears to be summing all the elements in the input list to produce the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the new input: [100, 58, 13, 12, 5, 63, 45, 37, 18]. We'll calculate the sum of these numbers.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the sum of the input list\ninput_list = [100, 58, 13, 12, 5, 63, 45, 37, 18]\noutput = sum(input_list)\noutput\nassistant > The sum of the input list [100, 58, 13, 12, 5, 63, 45, 37, 18] is 351. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<[351]>>>"
