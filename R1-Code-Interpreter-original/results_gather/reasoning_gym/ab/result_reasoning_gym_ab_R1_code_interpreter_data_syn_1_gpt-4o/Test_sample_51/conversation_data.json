    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the given A::B program according to the specified rules. The program is a sequence of tokens, and we need to apply the rules iteratively until no more rewrites are possible.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Program**: Start with the given sequence of tokens.\n2. **Apply Rewriting Rules**: Iterate through the sequence and apply the rewriting rules to neighboring tokens:\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing (both tokens are removed).\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#` (tokens are swapped).\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#` (tokens are swapped).\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing (both tokens are removed).\n3. **Repeat**: Continue applying the rules until no more changes can be made.\n4. **Output the Final State**: Once no more rewrites are possible, the sequence is in its final state.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the final state of the program.\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['#B', '#B', 'A#', 'B#', '#B', 'A#', 'A#', 'B#', 'B#', 'B#']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Print the final state\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rewriting process and output the final state of the program. Let's execute it to find the result.",
