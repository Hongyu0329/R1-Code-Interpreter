    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: `B# #B #B #A #B A# A# B# #A B#`\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Start from the left and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rules.\n   - Apply the rule and rewrite the sequence.\n   - Repeat the process until no more rules can be applied.\n\n3. **Rules**:\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n\nLet's implement this process using Python to ensure we apply the rules correctly and efficiently.\n\n```python\ndef apply_rules(program):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(program) - 1:\n        if program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program = program[:i] + program[i+2:]\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program = program[:i] + ['#B', 'A#'] + program[i+2:]\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program = program[:i] + ['#A', 'B#'] + program[i+2:]\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program = program[:i] + program[i+2:]\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return program\n\ninitial_program = ['B#', '#B', '#B', '#A', '#B', 'A#', 'A#', 'B#', '#A', 'B#']\nfinal_program = apply_rules(initial_program)\nprint(' '.join(final_program))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the program.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final state of the program after applying all the rewriting rules is `#B #A #B A# B# B#`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#B #A #B A# B# B#>>>"
