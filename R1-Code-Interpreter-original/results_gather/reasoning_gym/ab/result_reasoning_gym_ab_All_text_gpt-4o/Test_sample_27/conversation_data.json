    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# A# #B A# B# #A A# A# #B #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `B# A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# #B` → Apply rule: `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #B A# A# B# #A A# A# #B #B`\n   - `#B A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #B A# #A B# A# A# #B #B`\n   - `#A A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# #B` → Apply rule: `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #B A# #A B# A# #B A# #B`\n   - `#B A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# #B` → Apply rule: `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #B A# #A B# A# #B #B A#`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` → Apply rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing\n     - New sequence: `A# #A B# A# #B #B A#`\n   - `A# #A` → Apply rule: `A# #A` becomes nothing\n     - New sequence: `B# A# #B #B A#`\n   - `B# A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# #B` → Apply rule: `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #B A# #B A#`\n   - `#B A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# #B` → Apply rule: `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #B #B A# A#`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` → Apply rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing\n     - New sequence: `#B A# A#`\n   - `#B A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# A#` → No rule applies.\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `#B A#` → No rule applies.\n   - `A# A#` → No rule applies.\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied, and the sequence is stable.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\n#B A# A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#B A# A#>>>"
