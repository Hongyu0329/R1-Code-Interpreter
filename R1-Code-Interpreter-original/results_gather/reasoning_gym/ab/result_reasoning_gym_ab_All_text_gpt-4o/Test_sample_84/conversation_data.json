    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A A# A# B# #B #B B# #A #B #B\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule 1 (A# #A becomes nothing):**\n   - Look for `A# #A` in the sequence. There are no such pairs, so move to the next rule.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 2 (A# #B becomes #B A#):**\n   - Look for `A# #B` in the sequence. The first occurrence is at positions 3 and 4:\n     ```\n     #A A# A# B# #B #B B# #A #B #B\n             ^  ^\n     ```\n   - Replace `A# #B` with `#B A#`:\n     ```\n     #A A# #B A# #B #B B# #A #B #B\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule 3 (B# #A becomes #A B#):**\n   - Look for `B# #A` in the sequence. The first occurrence is at positions 6 and 7:\n     ```\n     #A A# #B A# #B #B B# #A #B #B\n                       ^  ^\n     ```\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #A A# #B A# #B #B #A B# #B #B\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule 4 (B# #B becomes nothing):**\n   - Look for `B# #B` in the sequence. The first occurrence is at positions 5 and 6:\n     ```\n     #A A# #B A# #B #B #A B# #B #B\n                   ^  ^\n     ```\n   - Remove `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #A A# #B A# #A B# #B #B\n     ```\n\n5. **Repeat the process:**\n\n   - Apply Rule 2 (A# #B becomes #B A#):\n     - Occurrence at positions 3 and 4:\n       ```\n       #A A# #B A# #A B# #B #B\n               ^  ^\n       ```\n     - Replace `A# #B` with `#B A#`:\n       ```\n       #A A# #B #B A# #A B# #B\n       ```\n\n   - Apply Rule 3 (B# #A becomes #A B#):\n     - Occurrence at positions 5 and 6:\n       ```\n       #A A# #B #B A# #A B# #B\n                     ^  ^\n       ```\n     - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n       ```\n       #A A# #B #B #A B# #B\n       ```\n\n   - Apply Rule 4 (B# #B becomes nothing):\n     - Occurrence at positions 3 and 4:\n       ```\n       #A A# #B #B #A B# #B\n                 ^  ^\n       ```\n     - Remove `B# #B`:\n       ```\n       #A A# #A B# #B\n       ```\n\n6. **Final check:**\n\n   - Apply Rule 1 (A# #A becomes nothing):\n     - Occurrence at positions 2 and 3:\n       ```\n       #A A# #A B# #B\n           ^  ^\n       ```\n     - Remove `A# #A`:\n       ```\n       #A B# #B\n       ```\n\n   - Apply Rule 4 (B# #B becomes nothing):\n     - Occurrence at positions 1 and 2:\n       ```\n       #A B# #B\n           ^  ^\n       ```\n     - Remove `B# #B`:\n       ```\n       #A\n       ```\n\nNo more rules can be applied.
