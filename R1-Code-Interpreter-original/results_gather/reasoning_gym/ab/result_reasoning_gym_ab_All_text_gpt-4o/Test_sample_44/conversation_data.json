    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A #B #B B# #A A# #B B# #A #A\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `#A #B` can be rewritten as `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - `A# #A` and `B# #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Start from the leftmost pair and move right, applying rules where possible.\n\n3. **Step-by-step application:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Apply `#A #B` → `#B A#` to the first two tokens:\n     ```\n     #B A# #B B# #A A# #B B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 2:** Apply `#B B#` → nothing to the third and fourth tokens:\n     ```\n     #B A# #A A# #B B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 3:** Apply `A# #A` → nothing to the second and third tokens:\n     ```\n     #B #B B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 4:** Apply `#B B#` → nothing to the first and second tokens:\n     ```\n     B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 5:** Apply `B# #A` → `#A B#` to the first and second tokens:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 6:** Apply `B# #A` → `#A B#` to the second and third tokens:\n     ```\n     #A #A B#\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 7:** Apply `#A #A` → nothing to the first and second tokens:\n     ```\n     B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Final state:**\n   - The sequence is reduced to a single token `B#`.\n\nTherefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n<<<B#>>>"
