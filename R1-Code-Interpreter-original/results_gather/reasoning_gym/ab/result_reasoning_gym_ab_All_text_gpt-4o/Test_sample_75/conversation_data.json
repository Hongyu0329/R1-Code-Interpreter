    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# #B #B #A B# #B A# #A #A A#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (Rule: B# #B ... becomes ... nothing)\n   - `#B #A` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `#A B#` becomes `B# #A` (Rule: B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#)\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (Rule: B# #B ... becomes ... nothing)\n   - `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing` (Rule: A# #A ... becomes ... nothing)\n   - `#A A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #A B# #B A# #A\n```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `#B #A` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `#A B#` becomes `B# #A` (Rule: B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#)\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (Rule: B# #B ... becomes ... nothing)\n   - `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing` (Rule: A# #A ... becomes ... nothing)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B B# #B A#\n```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `#B B#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (Rule: B# #B ... becomes ... nothing)\n   - `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B A#\n```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nNo further changes can be made, so the final state of the program is:\n```\n#B A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B A#>>>"
