    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rewrites are possible. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# B# B# B# #A #B #B #A #A #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `B# B#` → No rewrite (no facing `#`)\n   - `B# B#` → No rewrite\n   - `B# B#` → No rewrite\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - Result: `B# B# B# #A B# #B #A #A #B`\n   - `B# #B` → Apply rule `B# #B` becomes nothing\n     - Result: `B# B# B# #A #A #A #B`\n   - `#A #A` → No rewrite\n   - `#A #B` → Apply rule `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n     - Result: `B# B# B# #A #A #B A#`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# B#` → No rewrite\n   - `B# B#` → No rewrite\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - Result: `B# B# #A B# #A #B A#`\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - Result: `B# #A B# B# #B A#`\n   - `B# #B` → Apply rule `B# #B` becomes nothing\n     - Result: `B# #A B# A#`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - Result: `#A B# B# A#`\n   - `B# A#` → No rewrite\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `#A B#` → No rewrite\n   - `B# A#` → No rewrite\n\nAt this point, no more rewrites are possible. The final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A B# B# A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B# B# A#>>>"
