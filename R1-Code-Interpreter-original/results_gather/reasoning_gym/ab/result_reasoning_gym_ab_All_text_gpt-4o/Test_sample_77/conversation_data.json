    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A B# #B #B A# A# B# #B #A A#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `#A B#` can be rewritten as `#A B#` (no change, as they don't face each other).\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten as `nothing` (rule: B# #B becomes nothing).\n   - `#B #B` can be rewritten as `nothing` (rule: B# #B becomes nothing).\n   - `A# A#` can be rewritten as `nothing` (rule: A# #A becomes nothing).\n   - `A# B#` can be rewritten as `#A B#` (rule: B# #A becomes #A B#).\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `#A B#` remains unchanged.\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing`.\n   - `#B #B` becomes `nothing`.\n   - `A# A#` becomes `nothing`.\n   - `A# B#` becomes `#A B#`.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#A #A B# #B #A\n```\n\n3. **Repeat the process:**\n   - `#A #A` can be rewritten as `nothing` (rule: A# #A becomes nothing).\n   - `#A B#` can be rewritten as `#A B#` (no change, as they don't face each other).\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten as `nothing` (rule: B# #B becomes nothing).\n   - `#B #A` can be rewritten as `#A B#` (rule: B# #A becomes #A B#).\n\n4. **Apply the rules again:**\n   - `#A #A` becomes `nothing`.\n   - `#A B#` remains unchanged.\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing`.\n   - `#B #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#A #A B#\n```\n\n5. **Final check:**\n   - `#A #A` can be rewritten as `nothing` (rule: A# #A becomes nothing).\n   - `#A B#` can be rewritten as `#A B#` (no change, as they don't face each other).\n\n6. **Apply the final rules:**\n   - `#A #A` becomes `nothing`.\n   - `#A B#` remains unchanged.\n\nThe final sequence is:\n```\n#A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n<<<#A B#>>>"
