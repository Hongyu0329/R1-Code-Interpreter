    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A A# #B A# #A B# #B #B #A B#\n```\n\n1. **Apply the rule `A# #A` becomes nothing:**\n   - Find `A# #A` in the sequence. It appears between the third and fourth tokens.\n   - Remove `A# #A` from the sequence.\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A A# #B B# #B #B #A B#\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply the rule `B# #B` becomes nothing:**\n   - Find `B# #B` in the sequence. It appears between the fourth and fifth tokens.\n   - Remove `B# #B` from the sequence.\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A A# #B #B #A B#\n   ```\n\n3. **Apply the rule `B# #B` becomes nothing:**\n   - Find `B# #B` in the sequence. It appears between the third and fourth tokens.\n   - Remove `B# #B` from the sequence.\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A A# #A B#\n   ```\n\n4. **Apply the rule `A# #A` becomes nothing:**\n   - Find `A# #A` in the sequence. It appears between the second and third tokens.\n   - Remove `A# #A` from the sequence.\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A B#\n   ```\n\n5. **No more rules can be applied:**\n   - The sequence `#A B#` does not match any of the rewrite rules, so we stop here.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B#>>>"
