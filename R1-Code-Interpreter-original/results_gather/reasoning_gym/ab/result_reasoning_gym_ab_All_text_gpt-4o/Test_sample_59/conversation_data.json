    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# B# B# #B #B #B #B #B #A B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that can be rewritten according to the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `A# B#`. However, this does not match any rule, so we move to the next pair.\n   - The next pair is `B# B#`, which also does not match any rule.\n   - The next pair is `B# #B`, which matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`. So, we remove `B# #B`.\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     A# B# #B #B #B #B #A B#\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `A# B#`, which does not match any rule.\n   - The next pair is `B# #B`, which matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`. So, we remove `B# #B`.\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     A# B# #B #B #A B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `A# B#`, which does not match any rule.\n   - The next pair is `B# #B`, which matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`. So, we remove `B# #B`.\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     A# B# #B #A B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `A# B#`, which does not match any rule.\n   - The next pair is `B# #B`, which matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`. So, we remove `B# #B`.\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     A# B# #A B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `A# B#`, which does not match any rule.\n   - The next pair is `B# #A`, which matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`. So, we rewrite `B# #A` as `#A B#`.\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     A# #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `A# #A`, which matches the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`. So, we remove `A# #A`.\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     B# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - The only pair is `B# B#`, which does not match any rule.\n\nSince no more rules can be applied, the final state of the program is:\n```\nB# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<B# B#>>>"
