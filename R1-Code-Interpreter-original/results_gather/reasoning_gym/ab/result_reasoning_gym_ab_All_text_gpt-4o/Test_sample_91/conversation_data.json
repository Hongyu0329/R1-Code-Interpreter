    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\nA# #A A# #B #A A# A# #B #A #A\n```\n\n1. **Apply the rule `A# #A` becomes nothing:**\n   - The first two tokens `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New sequence: `A# #B #A A# A# #B #A #A`\n\n2. **Apply the rule `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`:**\n   - The first two tokens `A# #B` can be rewritten to `#B A#`.\n   - New sequence: `#B A# #A A# A# #B #A #A`\n\n3. **Apply the rule `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`:**\n   - The first two tokens `#B A#` do not match any rule, so we move to the next pair.\n   - The next pair `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#B A# A# #B #A #A`\n\n4. **Apply the rule `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`:**\n   - The first two tokens `#B A#` do not match any rule, so we move to the next pair.\n   - The next pair `A# #B` can be rewritten to `#B A#`.\n   - New sequence: `#B #B A# #A #A`\n\n5. **Apply the rule `B# #B` becomes nothing:**\n   - The first two tokens `#B #B` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New sequence: `A# #A #A`\n\n6. **Apply the rule `A# #A` becomes nothing:**\n   - The first two tokens `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#A`\n\n7. **No more rules can be applied:**\n   - The sequence `#A` does not match any rule, so we stop here.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A>>>"
