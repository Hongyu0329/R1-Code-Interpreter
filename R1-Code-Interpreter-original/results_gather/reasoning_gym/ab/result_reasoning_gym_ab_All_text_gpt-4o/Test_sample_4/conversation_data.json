    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A A# A# #A A# A# B# B# #A #B\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# A# #A` (between the 2nd and 4th tokens)\n   - Rewrite: `A# A# #A` becomes `A#` (removing `A# #A`)\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A A# A# A# B# B# #A #B\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# A# #A` (between the 3rd and 5th tokens)\n   - Rewrite: `A# A# #A` becomes `A#` (removing `A# #A`)\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A A# A# B# B# #A #B\n   ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - `B# B# #A` (between the 4th and 6th tokens)\n   - Rewrite: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A A# A# #A B# #B\n   ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# A# #A` (between the 2nd and 4th tokens)\n   - Rewrite: `A# A# #A` becomes `A#` (removing `A# #A`)\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A A# B# #B\n   ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - `B# #B` (between the 3rd and 4th tokens)\n   - Rewrite: `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\n   New sequence:\n   ```\n   #A A#\n   ```\n\nNo more rules can be applied as there are no neighboring tokens that match any of the rules. Therefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A A#\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A A#>>>"
