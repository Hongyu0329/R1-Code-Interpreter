    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #B B# B# B# B# B# A# #A #B\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - The sequence contains `A# #A`, which can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - The sequence contains `B# #A`, which can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n   - The sequence contains `B# #B`, which can be rewritten to nothing.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Start from the left and look for applicable rules:\n     - `#B #B` - No rule applies.\n     - `#B B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# A#` - No rule applies.\n     - `A# #A` - Apply the rule `A# #A` becomes nothing. Remove `A# #A`.\n\n   After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n   ```\n   #B #B B# B# B# B# B# #B\n   ```\n\n3. **Repeat the process:**\n   - Check the sequence again for applicable rules:\n     - `#B #B` - No rule applies.\n     - `#B B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# #B` - Apply the rule `B# #B` becomes nothing. Remove `B# #B`.\n\n   After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n   ```\n   #B #B B# B# B#\n   ```\n\n4. **Continue until no more rules can be applied:**\n   - Check the sequence again:\n     - `#B #B` - No rule applies.\n     - `#B B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# B#` - No rule applies.\n\n   No more rules can be applied, so the process stops here.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #B B# B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B #B B# B# B#>>>"
