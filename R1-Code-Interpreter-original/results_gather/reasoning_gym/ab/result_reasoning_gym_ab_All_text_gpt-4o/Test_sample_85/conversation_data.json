    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# B# B# B# #B B# #B A# #A #A\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - The rules are applied to pairs of tokens where the '#' symbols face each other.\n   - We will scan the sequence from left to right and apply the rules wherever applicable.\n\n2. **First pass:**\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# #B` (apply rule: B# #B becomes nothing)\n   - After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# B# B# #B A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Second pass:**\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# #B` (apply rule: B# #B becomes nothing)\n   - After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# B# A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Third pass:**\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# A#` (no rule applies)\n   - `A# #A` (apply rule: A# #A becomes nothing)\n   - After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# B# #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Fourth pass:**\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# #A` (apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#)\n   - After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# #A B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Fifth pass:**\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# #A` (apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#)\n   - After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Sixth pass:**\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# #A` (apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#)\n   - After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n8. **Seventh pass:**\n   - `B# #A` (apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#)\n   - After applying the rule, the sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n9. **Eighth pass:**\n   - `#A B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` (no rule applies)\n\nNo more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n```\n#A B# B# B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A B# B# B# B#>>>"
