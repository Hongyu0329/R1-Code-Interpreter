Example:\n\n    B# A# #B #A B#\n\nTo *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:\n\n    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing\n    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#\n    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#\n    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing\n\nIn other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,\nthey must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.\n\nNow, consider the following program:\n\n#A A# #B B# #B #A A# #B #B B#\n\nReturn the final state of the program.\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A A# #B B# #B #A A# #B #B B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `#A A#` becomes `nothing` (Rule: A# #A)\n   - Sequence becomes: `#B B# #B #A A# #B #B B#`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (Rule: B# #B)\n   - Sequence becomes: `#B #A A# #B #B B#`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `#A A#` becomes `nothing` (Rule: A# #A)\n   - Sequence becomes: `#B #B B#`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (Rule: B# #B)\n   - Sequence becomes: `#B`\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied because there are no neighboring tokens with their '#' facing each other. Therefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#B\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#B>>>"
