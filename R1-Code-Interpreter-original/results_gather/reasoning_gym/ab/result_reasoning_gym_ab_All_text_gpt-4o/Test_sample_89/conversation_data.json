    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. We will go through the sequence step by step, applying the rules wherever applicable, until no more rules can be applied.\n\nGiven program:  \nA# B# #B B# B# #A #A B# #B A#\n\nLet's analyze and apply the rules:\n\n1. **Initial sequence**: A# B# #B B# B# #A #A B# #B A#\n\n2. **First pass**:\n   - A# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #B -> Apply rule: B# #B becomes nothing.  \n     New sequence: A# B# B# B# #A #A B# #B A#\n   - B# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#.  \n     New sequence: A# B# B# #A B# #A B# #B A#\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #B -> Apply rule: B# #B becomes nothing.  \n     New sequence: A# B# B# #A B# #A B# A#\n\n3. **Second pass**:\n   - A# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#.  \n     New sequence: A# B# #A B# B# #A B# A#\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# A# -> No rule applies.\n\n4. **Third pass**:\n   - A# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#.  \n     New sequence: A# #A B# B# B# A#\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# A# -> No rule applies.\n\n5. **Fourth pass**:\n   - A# #A -> Apply rule: A# #A becomes nothing.  \n     New sequence: B# B# B# A#\n   - B# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# A# -> No rule applies.\n\n6. **Fifth pass**:\n   - B# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# A# -> No rule applies.\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied.
