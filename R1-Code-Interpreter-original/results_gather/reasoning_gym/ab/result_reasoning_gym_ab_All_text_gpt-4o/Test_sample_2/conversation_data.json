    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\n#A A# B# A# #B #A A# #B #A #A\n```\n\n1. **Identify pairs of tokens to rewrite:**\n   - `#A A#` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - `A# B#` can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - `B# A#` can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - `A# #B` can be rewritten as `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n\n2. **Apply the rules step by step:**\n\n   - First, apply the rule to `#A A#`:\n     ```\n     #A A# B# A# #B #A A# #B #A #A\n     becomes\n     B# A# #B #A A# #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n   - Next, apply the rule to `B# A#`:\n     ```\n     B# A# #B #A A# #B #A #A\n     becomes\n     #A B# #B #A A# #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n   - Apply the rule to `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #A B# #B #A A# #B #A #A\n     becomes\n     #A #A A# #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n   - Apply the rule to `#A A#`:\n     ```\n     #A #A A# #B #A #A\n     becomes\n     #A #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n   - Apply the rule to `#A A#`:\n     ```\n     #A #B #A #A\n     becomes\n     #B #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Final state:**\n   After applying all possible rewriting rules, the final state of the program is:\n   ```\n   #B #A\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#B #A>>>"
