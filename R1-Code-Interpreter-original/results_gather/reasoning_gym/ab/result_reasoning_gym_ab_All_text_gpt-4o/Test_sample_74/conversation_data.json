    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\n#B A# #B A# #A A# B# #B #A #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `A# #A` and `B# #B` become nothing\n\nLet's apply these rules to the sequence:\n\n- `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n- `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `A# #A` becomes nothing\n- `A# B#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `B# #B` becomes nothing\n- `#B #A` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `#A #B` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#B #B A# A# B# #A #B\n```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Apply the rules again to the new sequence:\n\n- `#B #B` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `A# A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `A# B#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n- `#A #B` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#B #B A# A# #A B# #B\n```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Apply the rules again to the new sequence:\n\n- `#B #B` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `A# A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `A# #A` becomes nothing\n- `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#B #B A# B#\n```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Apply the rules again to the new sequence:\n\n- `#B #B` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `#B A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n- `A# B#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence remains:\n```\n#B #B A# B#\n```\n\nSince no further rules can be applied, this is the final state of the program.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n<<<#B #B A# B#>>>\n```"
