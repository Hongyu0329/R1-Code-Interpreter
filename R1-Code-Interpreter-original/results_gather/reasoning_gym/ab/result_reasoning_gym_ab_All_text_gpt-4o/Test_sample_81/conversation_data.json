    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# #A A# #B #A B# #B A# A# #A\n```\n\n1. **Apply the rule `A# #A` becomes nothing:**\n   - The first two tokens `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New sequence: `A# #B #A B# #B A# A# #A`\n\n2. **Apply the rule `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`:**\n   - The first two tokens `A# #B` can be rewritten to `#B A#`.\n   - New sequence: `#B A# #A B# #B A# A# #A`\n\n3. **Apply the rule `A# #A` becomes nothing:**\n   - The tokens `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#B B# #B A# A# #A`\n\n4. **Apply the rule `B# #B` becomes nothing:**\n   - The tokens `B# #B` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#B A# A# #A`\n\n5. **Apply the rule `A# #A` becomes nothing:**\n   - The tokens `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#B A#`\n\n6. **No more rules can be applied:**\n   - The sequence `#B A#` does not match any of the rewrite rules, so we stop here.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n<<<#B A#>>>\n```"
