    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #A A# #B B# A# #A A# A# A#\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find `B# #A` in the sequence. The sequence has `B# A#` and `#A A#`, but no `B# #A`. So, this rule cannot be applied.\n\n2. **Apply Rule: `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`**\n   - Find `A# #B` in the sequence. The sequence has `A# #B` at position 3-4.\n   - Rewrite `A# #B` to `#B A#`.\n   - New sequence: `#B #A #B A# B# A# #A A# A# A#`\n\n3. **Apply Rule: `A# #A` becomes nothing**\n   - Find `A# #A` in the sequence. The sequence has `A# #A` at position 6-7.\n   - Remove `A# #A`.\n   - New sequence: `#B #A #B A# B# A# A# A# A#`\n\n4. **Apply Rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing**\n   - Find `B# #B` in the sequence. The sequence has `B# #B` at position 4-5.\n   - Remove `B# #B`.\n   - New sequence: `#B #A #B A# A# A# A#`\n\n5. **Apply Rule: `A# #A` becomes nothing**\n   - Find `A# #A` in the sequence. The sequence has `A# #A` at position 4-5.\n   - Remove `A# #A`.\n   - New sequence: `#B #A #B A# A#`\n\n6. **Apply Rule: `A# #A` becomes nothing**\n   - Find `A# #A` in the sequence. The sequence has `A# #A` at position 4-5.\n   - Remove `A# #A`.\n   - New sequence: `#B #A #B A#`\n\n7. **Apply Rule: `A# #A` becomes nothing**\n   - There is no `A# #A` in the sequence now.\n\n8. **Apply Rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing**\n   - There is no `B# #B` in the sequence now.\n\n9. **Apply Rule: `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`**\n   - There is no `A# #B` in the sequence now.\n\n10. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n    - There is no `B# #A` in the sequence now.\n\nNo more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#B #A #B A#\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#B #A #B A#>>>"
