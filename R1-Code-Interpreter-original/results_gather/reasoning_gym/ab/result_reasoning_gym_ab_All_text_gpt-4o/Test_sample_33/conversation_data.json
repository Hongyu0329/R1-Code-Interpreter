    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #A #A B# #B #B #B #A #B B#\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - At position 3 and 4: `B# #A`\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #A B# #B #B #A #B B#\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule: `A# #A` becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - At position 2 and 3: `#A #A`\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A B# #B #B #A #B B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - At position 3 and 4: `B# #B`\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B #B #A #B B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - At position 2 and 3: `#B #B`\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #B B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - At position 1 and 2: `#A #A`\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Apply Rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - At position 2 and 3: `B# #B`\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - At position 1 and 2: `#A #A`\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B B#\n     ```\n\n8. **Apply Rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - At position 0 and 1: `#B B#`\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     (empty)\n     ```\n\nAfter applying all possible rules, the final state of the program is empty.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n<<<>>>\n```"
