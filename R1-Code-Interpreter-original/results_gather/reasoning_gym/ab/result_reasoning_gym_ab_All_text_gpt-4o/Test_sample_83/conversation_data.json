    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A B# A# A# #A #A #A #A #B A#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - `A# #B` can be rewritten to `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten to nothing.\n\n2. **Apply rules to the sequence:**\n\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Look for `A# #A`:\n       - `A# A# #A` contains `A# #A`, so it becomes `A#`.\n     - Sequence becomes:\n       ```\n       #A B# A# A# #A #A #A #B A#\n       ```\n     - Look for `B# #A`:\n       - `B# A# #A` contains `B# #A`, so it becomes `#A B#`.\n     - Sequence becomes:\n       ```\n       #A #A B# A# #A #A #B A#\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Look for `A# #A`:\n       - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n     - Sequence becomes:\n       ```\n       #A #A B# #A #B A#\n       ```\n     - Look for `B# #A`:\n       - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n     - Sequence becomes:\n       ```\n       #A #A #A B# #B A#\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Look for `A# #A`:\n       - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n     - Sequence becomes:\n       ```\n       #A #A B# #B A#\n       ```\n     - Look for `B# #B`:\n       - `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n     - Sequence becomes:\n       ```\n       #A #A A#\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 4:**\n     - Look for `A# #A`:\n       - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n     - Sequence becomes:\n       ```\n       #A A#\n       ```\n\n   - **Step 5:**\n     - Look for `A# #A`:\n       - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n     - Sequence becomes:\n       ```\n       (empty)\n       ```\n\n3. **Final state:**\n   - The sequence is now empty, meaning no more rules can be applied.\n\nThe final state of the program is an empty sequence.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n<<<>>>\n```"
