    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #A #A B# #B #A A# #A B# A#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A B#` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#` in reverse, so it stays as `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - `#B #A` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#` in reverse, so it stays as `#B #A`.\n   - `A# #A` matches the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing, so remove `B# #B`.\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing, so remove `A# #A`.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#B #A B# #A B#\n```\n\n3. **Repeat the process:**\n\n   - `#A B#` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#` in reverse, so it stays as `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #A` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`.\n\n4. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#B #A #A B# B#\n```\n\n5. **Repeat the process:**\n\n   - `#A B#` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#` in reverse, so it stays as `#A B#`.\n   - `B# B#` matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`.\n\n6. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `B# B#` becomes nothing, so remove `B# B#`.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#B #A #A\n```\n\n7. **Final check:**\n   - No more rules can be applied as there are no neighboring tokens with `#` facing each other.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #A #A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B #A #A>>>"
