    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# B# #A #A #A B# #A B# #B B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - A# B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#\n     - New sequence: A# #A B# #A #A B# #A B# #B B#\n   - #A #A -> No rule applies.\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#\n     - New sequence: A# #A #A B# #A B# #A B# #B B#\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #B -> Apply rule: B# #B becomes nothing\n     - New sequence: A# #A #A B# #A B# #A B#\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - A# #A -> Apply rule: A# #A becomes nothing\n     - New sequence: #A #A B# #A B# #A B#\n   - #A #A -> No rule applies.\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#\n     - New sequence: #A #A #A B# #A B# #A B#\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - #A #A -> No rule applies.\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#\n     - New sequence: #A #A #A #A B# #A B#\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - #A #A -> No rule applies.\n   - #A #A -> No rule applies.\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#\n     - New sequence: #A #A #A #A #A B# B#\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - #A #A -> No rule applies.\n   - #A #A -> No rule applies.\n   - #A #A -> No rule applies.\n   - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n   - B# B# -> Apply rule: B# B# becomes nothing\n     - New sequence: #A #A #A #A #A\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied, and the sequence is stable.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\n#A #A #A #A #A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A #A #A #A #A>>>"
