    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B B# A# A# #B #B #A A# #B A#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens where the '#' symbols are facing each other.\n   - Apply the rules in the order they appear from left to right.\n\n2. **First pass:**\n   - `B# A#` can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - `A# #B` can be rewritten as `#B A#`.\n   - `A# #A` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n\n3. **Apply rules:**\n   - The first applicable pair is `B# A#` at positions 2 and 3. Rewrite it as `#A B#`.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #A B# A# #B #B #A A# #B A#`.\n\n4. **Second pass:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `A# #B` at positions 4 and 5. Rewrite it as `#B A#`.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #A B# #B A# #B #A A# #B A#`.\n\n5. **Third pass:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `B# #B` at positions 3 and 4. Rewrite it as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #A #B A# #B #A A# #B A#`.\n\n6. **Fourth pass:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `A# #A` at positions 4 and 5. Rewrite it as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #A #B #B #A A# #B A#`.\n\n7. **Fifth pass:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `B# #B` at positions 3 and 4. Rewrite it as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #A #A A# #B A#`.\n\n8. **Sixth pass:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `A# #A` at positions 3 and 4. Rewrite it as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #A #B A#`.\n\n9. **Seventh pass:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `B# A#` at positions 3 and 4. Rewrite it as `#A B#`.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #A #A B#`.\n\n10. **Eighth pass:**\n    - The next applicable pair is `A# #A` at positions 3 and 4. Rewrite it as nothing.\n    - The sequence becomes: `#B #B`.\n\n11. **Ninth pass:**\n    - The next applicable pair is `B# #B` at positions 1 and 2. Rewrite it as nothing.\n    - The sequence becomes: ` ` (empty).\n\nSince no more rules can be applied, the final state of the program is empty.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n<<< >>>\n```"
