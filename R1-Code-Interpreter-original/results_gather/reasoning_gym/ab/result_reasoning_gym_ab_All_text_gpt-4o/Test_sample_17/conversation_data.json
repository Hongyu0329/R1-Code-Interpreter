    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# #A #B A# #A A# A# #A B# #B\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule 1 (A# #A becomes nothing):**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# #A #B A# #A A# A# #A B# #B` → `#B A# #A A# A# #A B# #B`\n   - Find the next occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `#B A# #A A# A# #A B# #B` → `#B A# A# #A B# #B`\n   - Find the next occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `#B A# A# #A B# #B` → `#B A# B# #B`\n\n2. **Apply Rule 4 (B# #B becomes nothing):**\n   - Find the occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - `#B A# B# #B` → `#B A#`\n\n3. **No more rules can be applied:**\n   - The sequence `#B A#` does not match any of the rewrite rules.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n<<<#B A#>>>\n```"
