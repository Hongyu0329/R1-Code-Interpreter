    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# #B #A B# B# B# #B B# A# #A\n```\n\n1. **Step 1:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that can be rewritten according to the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# B# #B B# A# #A\n     ```\n\n2. **Step 2:**\n   - The next pair that matches a rule is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# #B B# A# #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Step 3:**\n   - The next pair that matches a rule is `#A A#`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     B# B# #B B# A# #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Step 4:**\n   - The next pair that matches a rule is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# A# #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Step 5:**\n   - The next pair that matches a rule is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A B# A# #A\n     ```\n\n6. **Step 6:**\n   - The next pair that matches a rule is `#A A#`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Step 7:**\n   - There are no more pairs that match any of the rules. The program is in its final state.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\nB# B# B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<B# B# B# B#>>>"
