    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B B# B# #A #A #A A# #B #A #A\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #B B# B# #A #A #A A# #B #A #A\n           ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B B# #A B# #A #A A# #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #B B# #A B# #A #A A# #B #A #A\n               ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B B# #A #A B# #A A# #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #B B# #A #A B# #A A# #B #A #A\n                   ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B B# #A #A #A B# A# #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule: `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`**\n   - Find the occurrence of `A# #B`:\n     ```\n     #B B# #A #A #A B# A# #B #A #A\n                           ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B B# #A #A #A B# #B A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule: `#B B#` becomes `nothing`**\n   - Find the occurrence of `#B B#`:\n     ```\n     #B B# #A #A #A B# #B A# #A #A\n     ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     B# #A #A #A B# #B A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n6. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     B# #A #A #A B# #B A# #A #A\n     ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A #A B# #B A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n7. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A #A B# #B A# #A #A\n           ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# #A B# #B A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n8. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# #A B# #B A# #A #A\n               ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# B# #B A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n9. **Apply Rule: `#B B#` becomes `nothing`**\n   - Find the occurrence of `#B B#`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# B# #B A# #A #A\n                   ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n10. **Apply Rule: `A# #A` becomes `nothing`**\n    - Find the occurrence of `A# #A`:\n      ```\n      #A #A #A B# A# #A #A\n                   ^^^^\n      ```\n    - Rewrite it:\n      ```\n      #A #A #A B# #A\n      ```\n\n11. **Apply Rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`**\n    - Find the occurrence of `B# #A`:\n      ```\n      #A #A #A B# #A\n               ^^^^\n      ```\n    - Rewrite it:\n      ```\n      #A #A #A #A B#\n      ```\n\nNow, no more rules can be applied.
