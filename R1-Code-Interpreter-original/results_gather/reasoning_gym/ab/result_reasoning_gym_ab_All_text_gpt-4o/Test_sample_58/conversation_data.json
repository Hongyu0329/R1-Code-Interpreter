    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# A# #B #A #A #B #A #A #B #A\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `A# #A` and `B# #B` become nothing\n\nLet's apply these rules:\n\n- `B# A#` (no rule applies here)\n- `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n- `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n- `#A #A` (no rule applies here)\n- `#A #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #A` becomes `#A B#`\n- `#A #A` (no rule applies here)\n- `#A #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #A` becomes `#A B#`\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\nB# #B A# #A #A #B #A #A #A B#\n```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing\n   - `#B A#` (no rule applies here)\n   - `#A #A` (no rule applies here)\n   - `#A #B` (no rule applies here)\n   - `#B #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `#A #A` (no rule applies here)\n   - `#A B#` (no rule applies here)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\nA# #A #B #A #A #A B#\n```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing\n   - `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n   - `#A #A` (no rule applies here)\n   - `#A B#` (no rule applies here)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #A #A #A B#\n```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n   - `#A #A` (no rule applies here)\n   - `#A B#` (no rule applies here)\n\nNo more rules can be applied, so the final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #A #A #A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B #A #A #A B#>>>"
