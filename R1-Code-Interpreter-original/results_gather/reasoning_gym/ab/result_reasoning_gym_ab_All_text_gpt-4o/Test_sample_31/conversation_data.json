    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #B #A #A #B A# #B A# A# B#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `#A #B` is not present.\n   - `A# #A` is not present.\n   - `A# #B` is present at position 6-7: `A# #B`.\n   - `B# #A` is present at position 5-6: `#B A#`.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Apply `B# #A` rule at position 5-6: `#B A#` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #B #A #A #A B# #B A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Identify applicable rules again:**\n   - `A# #A` is not present.\n   - `A# #B` is present at position 7-8: `A# #B`.\n   - `B# #A` is present at position 6-7: `B# #A`.\n\n4. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Apply `B# #A` rule at position 6-7: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #B #A #A #A #A B# A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Identify applicable rules again:**\n   - `A# #A` is not present.\n   - `A# #B` is present at position 8-9: `A# #B`.\n   - `B# #A` is present at position 7-8: `B# A#`.\n\n6. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Apply `B# #A` rule at position 7-8: `B# A#` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #B #A #A #A #A #A B# A# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Identify applicable rules again:**\n   - `A# #A` is not present.\n   - `A# #B` is present at position 9-10: `A# B#`.\n   - `B# #A` is not present.\n\n8. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Apply `A# #B` rule at position 9-10: `A# B#` becomes `#B A#`.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #B #A #A #A #A #A #B A# B#\n     ```\n\n9. **Identify applicable rules again:**\n   - `A# #A` is not present.\n   - `A# #B` is not present.\n   - `B# #A` is not present.\n\nSince no more rules can be applied, the final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #B #A #A #A #A #A #B A# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B #B #A #A #A #A #A #B A# B#>>>"
