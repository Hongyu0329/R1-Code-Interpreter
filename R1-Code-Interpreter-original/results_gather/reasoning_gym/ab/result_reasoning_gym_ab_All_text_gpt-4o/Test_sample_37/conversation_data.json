    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# A# B# A# #A #A #B #B #B #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `A# #A`, which becomes nothing. Remove these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `A# B# A# #A #B #B #B #B`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Again, look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `A# #A`, which becomes nothing. Remove these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `A# B# #B #B #B #B`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing. Remove these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `A# B# #B #B`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing. Remove these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `A# B#`\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - The pair `A# B#` does not match any rule, and there are no other pairs to consider.\n\nSince no more rules can be applied, the final state of the program is:\n```\nA# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<A# B#>>>"
