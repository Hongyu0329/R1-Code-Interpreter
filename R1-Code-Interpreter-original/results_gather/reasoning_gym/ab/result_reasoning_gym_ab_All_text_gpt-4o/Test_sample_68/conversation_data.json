    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\nB# #B #B B# #B #A #B A# A# A#\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - `B# #B` is found at the start.\n   - Remove `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #B B# #B #A #B A# A# A#\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - `B# #B` is found starting from the second token.\n   - Remove `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B A# A# A#\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - `B# #A` is found starting from the third token.\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A B# A# A#\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# #A` is found starting from the fourth token.\n   - Remove `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #B #A B# A#\n     ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - `B# #A` is found starting from the third token.\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# #A` is found starting from the second token.\n   - Remove `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #B B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - `B# #B` is found starting from the first token.\n   - Remove `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     (empty)\n     ```\n\nThe sequence is now empty, and no more rules can be applied. Therefore, the final state of the program is an empty sequence.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n<<<>>>\n```"
