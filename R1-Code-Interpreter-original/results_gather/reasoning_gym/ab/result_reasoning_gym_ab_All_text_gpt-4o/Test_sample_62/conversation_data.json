    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# A# #A #A #B A# #B #A #A #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. We find `A# #A` at positions 2 and 3.\n   - After removing `A# #A`, the program becomes:\n     ```\n     B# #A #B A# #B #A #A #B\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 1 and 2.\n   - After rewriting, the program becomes:\n     ```\n     #A B# #B A# #B #A #A #B\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing. We find `B# #B` at positions 2 and 3.\n   - After removing `B# #B`, the program becomes:\n     ```\n     #A A# #B #A #A #B\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`. We find `A# #B` at positions 2 and 3.\n   - After rewriting, the program becomes:\n     ```\n     #A #B A# #A #A #B\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `#A A#` becomes nothing. We find `A# #A` at positions 3 and 4.\n   - After removing `A# #A`, the program becomes:\n     ```\n     #A #B #A #B\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 2 and 3.\n   - After rewriting, the program becomes:\n     ```\n     #A #B #A #B\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing. We find `B# #B` at positions 2 and 3.\n   - After removing `B# #B`, the program becomes:\n     ```\n     #A #A\n     ```\n\n8. **Eighth Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. We find `A# #A` at positions 1 and 2.\n   - After removing `A# #A`, the program becomes:\n     ```\n     (empty)\n     ```\n\nThe final state of the program is empty.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n<<<>>>\n```"
