    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# B# B# #A B# #B A# A# A# #A\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     A# B# #A B# B# #B A# A# A# #A\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Again, look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `A# #A`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# B# #B A# A# A# #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #B A# A# A# #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# A# A# A# #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches is `A# #A`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# A# A#\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that match the rules.\n   - No pairs match the rules, so the sequence remains unchanged.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A B# A# A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n<<<#A B# A# A#>>>\n```"
