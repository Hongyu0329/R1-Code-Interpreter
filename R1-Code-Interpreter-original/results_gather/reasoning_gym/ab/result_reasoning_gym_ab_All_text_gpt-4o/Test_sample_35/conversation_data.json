    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens step by step until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\nA# A# #B #B #B #A #B #B #A B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - A# #B: Apply the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`\n     - Sequence becomes: `A# #B A# #B #A #B #B #A B#`\n   - A# #B: Apply the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`\n     - Sequence becomes: `#B A# A# #B #A #B #B #A B#`\n   - A# #A: Apply the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`\n     - Sequence becomes: `#B #B #A #B #B #A B#`\n   - B# #A: Apply the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`\n     - Sequence becomes: `#B #A B# #B #A B#`\n   - B# #B: Apply the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`\n     - Sequence becomes: `#B #A #A B#`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - B# #A: Apply the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`\n     - Sequence becomes: `#A B# #A B#`\n   - A# #A: Apply the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`\n     - Sequence becomes: `B# B#`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - B# #B: Apply the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`\n     - Sequence becomes: `B#`\n\nNo more rules can be applied, and the sequence is reduced to a single token.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\nB#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B#>>>"
