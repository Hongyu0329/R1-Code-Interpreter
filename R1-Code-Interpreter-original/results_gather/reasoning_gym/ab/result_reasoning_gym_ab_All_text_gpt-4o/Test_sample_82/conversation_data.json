    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# A# #A B# A# B# #A A# #A #A\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. We find `A# #A` at positions 2 and 3. Remove them:\n     ```\n     B# B# A# B# #A A# #A #A\n     ```\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 4 and 5. Replace them:\n     ```\n     B# B# A# #A B# A# #A #A\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. We find `A# #A` at positions 3 and 4. Remove them:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# A# #A #A\n     ```\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 3 and 4. Replace them:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 2 and 3. Replace them:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# B# #A #A\n     ```\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 4 and 5. Replace them:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 2 and 3. Replace them:\n     ```\n     B# #A #A B# B# #A\n     ```\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 4 and 5. Replace them:\n     ```\n     B# #A #A #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 1 and 2. Replace them:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A #A B# B#\n     ```\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 3 and 4. Replace them:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A #A #A B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 2 and 3. Replace them:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` at positions 3 and 4. Replace them:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n8. **Eighth Pass:**\n   - No more applicable rules. The sequence is stable.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\n#A #A #A B# B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A #A #A B# B# B#>>>"
