    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# #A B# #A A# B# #B #A B# #A\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule 1: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# #A` is at the start of the sequence.\n   - Remove `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     B# #A A# B# #B #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule 3: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - `B# #A` is at the start of the sequence.\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #A B# A# B# #B #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule 1: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# #A` is not present, so move to the next rule.\n\n4. **Apply Rule 2: A# #B becomes #B A#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #B`:\n     - `A# #B` is not present, so move to the next rule.\n\n5. **Apply Rule 3: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - `B# #A` is at position 2.\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# #B #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n6. **Apply Rule 1: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# #A` is not present, so move to the next rule.\n\n7. **Apply Rule 4: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     - `B# #B` is at position 2.\n   - Remove `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n8. **Apply Rule 1: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     - `A# #A` is not present, so move to the next rule.\n\n9. **Apply Rule 3: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     - `B# #A` is at position 3.\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A #A B#\n     ```\n\n10. **Apply Rule 1: A# #A becomes nothing**\n    - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n      - `A# #A` is not present, so move to the next rule.\n\n11. **Apply Rule 2: A# #B becomes #B A#**\n    - Find the first occurrence of `A# #B`:\n      - `A# #B` is not present, so move to the next rule.\n\n12. **Apply Rule 3: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n    - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n      - `B# #A` is not present, so move to the next rule.\n\n13. **Apply Rule 4: B# #B becomes nothing**\n    - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n      - `B# #B` is not present.\n\nNo more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n```\n#A #A #A #A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A #A #A #A B#>>>"
