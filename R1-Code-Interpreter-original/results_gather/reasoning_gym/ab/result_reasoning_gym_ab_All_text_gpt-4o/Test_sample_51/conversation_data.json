    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\n#B #B A# B# #B A# A# B# B# B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# B#` becomes `#A B#` (using rule 3)\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (using rule 4)\n   - `A# A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #B #A B# A# A# B# B#\n```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `#B #A` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `B# A#` becomes `#A B#` (using rule 3)\n   - `A# A#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `B# B#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #B #A #A B# B#\n```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `#B #A` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n   - `#A #A` becomes `nothing` (using rule 1)\n   - `B# B#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #B B#\n```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `#B B#` remains unchanged (no rule applies)\n\nNo further changes can be made, as no rules apply to the remaining sequence.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #B B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B #B B#>>>"
