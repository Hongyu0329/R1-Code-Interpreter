    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B A# B# #B B# #A A# B# A# A#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `A# B#` is not a match for any rule.\n   - `B# #B` matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - `#B B#` is not a match for any rule.\n   - `B# #A` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`.\n   - `#A A#` matches the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - `A# B#` is not a match for any rule.\n   - `B# A#` is not a match for any rule.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Remove `B# #B` (at positions 3 and 4).\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#` (at positions 5 and 6).\n   - Remove `#A A#` (at positions 7 and 8).\n\nAfter applying these changes, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#B A# #A B# A# A#\n```\n\n3. **Repeat the process:**\n   - `A# #A` matches the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - `#A B#` is not a match for any rule.\n   - `B# A#` is not a match for any rule.\n\n4. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Remove `A# #A` (at positions 2 and 3).\n\nAfter applying these changes, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#B B# A#\n```\n\n5. **Final check:**\n   - `#B B#` is not a match for any rule.\n   - `B# A#` is not a match for any rule.\n\nSince no more rules can be applied, the final state of the program is:\n```\n#B B# A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B B# A#>>>"
