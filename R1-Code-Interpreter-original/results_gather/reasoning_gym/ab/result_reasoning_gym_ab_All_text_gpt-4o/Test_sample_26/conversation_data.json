    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# B# B# A# B# #B #B #A #A #A\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The first applicable rule is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing. This occurs between the 4th and 5th tokens (`B#` and `#B`).\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# A# #B #A #A #A\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Again, look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The next applicable rule is `A# #A`, which becomes nothing. This occurs between the 4th and 5th tokens (`A#` and `#A`).\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Continue looking for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The next applicable rule is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing. This occurs between the 3rd and 4th tokens (`B#` and `#B`).\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The next applicable rule is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`. This occurs between the 2nd and 3rd tokens (`B#` and `#A`).\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The next applicable rule is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`. This occurs between the 1st and 2nd tokens (`B#` and `#A`).\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #A\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The next applicable rule is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`. This occurs between the 2nd and 3rd tokens (`B#` and `#A`).\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - There are no more applicable rules, as no neighboring tokens have their '#' facing each other.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A #A B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A #A B# B#>>>"
