    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #B #B A# #B #A A# #A A# #A\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - The first applicable rule is `A# #B` which becomes `#B A#`. This occurs at positions 4 and 5:\n     ```\n     #B #B #B #B A# #A A# #A A# #A\n     ```\n   - Next, apply the rule `A# #A` which becomes nothing. This occurs at positions 5 and 6:\n     ```\n     #B #B #B #B A# A# #A A# #A\n     ```\n   - Apply `A# #A` again at positions 5 and 6:\n     ```\n     #B #B #B #B A# A# #A\n     ```\n   - Apply `A# #A` again at positions 5 and 6:\n     ```\n     #B #B #B #B A#\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Now, apply the rule `B# #B` which becomes nothing. This occurs at positions 1 and 2:\n     ```\n     #B #B #B A#\n     ```\n   - Apply `B# #B` again at positions 1 and 2:\n     ```\n     #B A#\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Finally, apply the rule `B# #A` which becomes `#A B#`. This occurs at positions 1 and 2:\n     ```\n     #A B#\n     ```\n\nNo more rules can be applied, so the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B#>>>"
