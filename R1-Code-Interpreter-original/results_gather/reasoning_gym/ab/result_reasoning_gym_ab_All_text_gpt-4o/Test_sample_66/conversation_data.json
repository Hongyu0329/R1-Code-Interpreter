    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A A# #A #B A# #B #A A# #B B#\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find `A# #A` in the sequence:\n     - `A# #A` is found at positions 2 and 3.\n   - Remove `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A #B A# #B #A A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule: A# #B becomes #B A#**\n   - Find `A# #B` in the sequence:\n     - `A# #B` is found at positions 3 and 4.\n   - Replace `A# #B` with `#B A#`:\n     ```\n     #A #B #B A# #A A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find `B# #A` in the sequence:\n     - `B# #A` is found at positions 5 and 6.\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #A #B #B #A B# A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find `A# #A` in the sequence:\n     - `A# #A` is found at positions 6 and 7.\n   - Remove `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A #B #B #A #B B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find `B# #B` in the sequence:\n     - `B# #B` is found at positions 5 and 6.\n   - Remove `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #A #B #B #A\n     ```\n\nNow, no more rules can be applied as there are no neighboring tokens that match any of the rules. Therefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A #B #B #A\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A #B #B #A>>>"
