    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #A #B #B B# #A B# #B A# #B\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens where the '#' symbols are facing each other.\n   - Apply the rules in the order they appear from left to right.\n\n2. **First pass:**\n   - `#B #A` can be rewritten using the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`. However, `#B #A` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n   - `#B #B` can be rewritten using the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`. However, `#B #B` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n   - `B# #A` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`. Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B #B #A B# B# #B A# #B\n     ```\n   - `B# #B` matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`. Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B #A B# #B A# #B\n     ```\n\n3. **Second pass:**\n   - `#B #A` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n   - `#B #A` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n   - `B# #B` matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`. Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B #A A# #B\n     ```\n\n4. **Third pass:**\n   - `#B #A` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n   - `#B #A` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n   - `A# #B` matches the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`. Rewrite it:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B #A #B A#\n     ```\n\n5. **Fourth pass:**\n   - `#B #A` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n   - `#B #A` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n   - `#A #B` does not match any rule directly, so we move on.\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied. The sequence is in its final state.\n\nFinal sequence:\n```\n#B #A #B #A #B A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n<<<#B #A #B #A #B A#>>>"
