    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# B# #B A# #A B# B# #A #A #A\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that can be rewritten according to the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `#B A#`, which becomes `#B A#` (no change, as per the rule).\n   - Next, `A# #A` becomes nothing. So, remove `A# #A`.\n   - The program now looks like:\n     ```\n     B# B# #B B# B# #A #A #A\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Again, look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing. So, remove `B# #B`.\n   - The program now looks like:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# #A #A #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - The program now looks like:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - The program now looks like:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# B# #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - The program now looks like:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - There are no more pairs that match any rule.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A B# B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B# B# B#>>>"
