    "To determine the final state of the given A::B program, we need to apply the rewriting rules iteratively until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the given program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# #A #B B# #B #B B# B# #B B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - New program: `#A B# #B B# #B #B B# B# #B B#`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n   - New program: `#A B# B# #B #B B# B# #B B#`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n   - New program: `#A B# B# #B B# B# #B B#`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n   - New program: `#A B# B# B# B# #B B#`\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n   - New program: `#A B# B# B# B# B#`\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied because there are no neighboring tokens with their '#' facing each other. Therefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A B# B# B# B# B#\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B# B# B# B# B#>>>"
