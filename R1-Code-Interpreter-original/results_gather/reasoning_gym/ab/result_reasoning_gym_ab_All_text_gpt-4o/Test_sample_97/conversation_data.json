    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\n#A A# #B B# #A B# A# B# B# #A\n```\n\n1. **Identify pairs of tokens that can be rewritten:**\n   - `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - `A# #B` can be rewritten to `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten to nothing.\n\n2. **Apply the rules to the program:**\n\n   - Start from the leftmost pair and move right, applying the rules where applicable.\n\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - `#A A#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `A# #B` can be rewritten to `#B A#`.\n     - New sequence: `#A #B A# B# #A B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - `#A #B` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `#B A#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `A# B#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `B# #A` can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n     - New sequence: `#A #B A# #A B# B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - `#A #B` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `#B A#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n     - New sequence: `#A #B B# B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n   - **Step 4:**\n     - `#A #B` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `#B B#` can be rewritten to nothing.\n     - New sequence: `#A B# B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n   - **Step 5:**\n     - `#A B#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `B# B#` can be rewritten to nothing.\n     - New sequence: `#A B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n   - **Step 6:**\n     - `#A B#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `B# A#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `A# B#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `B# #A` can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n     - New sequence: `#A B# A# #A B#`\n\n   - **Step 7:**\n     - `#A B#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `B# A#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n     - New sequence: `#A B# B#`\n\n   - **Step 8:**\n     - `#A B#` is not a pair that can be rewritten.\n     - `B# B#` can be rewritten to nothing.\n     - New sequence: `#A`\n\n3. **Final state:**\n   - The final state of the program is `#A`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A>>>"
