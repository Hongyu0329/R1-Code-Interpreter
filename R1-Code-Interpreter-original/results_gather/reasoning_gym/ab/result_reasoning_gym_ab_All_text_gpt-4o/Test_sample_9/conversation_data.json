    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #A B# B# #B #A #A #B A# B#\n```\n\n1. **Step 1:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rules.\n   - The first applicable pair is `#A B#`, which matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`.\n   - Rewrite `#A B#` as `#A B#`.\n   - Sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A B# B# #B #A #A #B A# B#\n     ```\n\n2. **Step 2:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `B# #A`, which matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`.\n   - Rewrite `B# #A` as `#A B#`.\n   - Sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #A B# #B #A #A #B A# B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Step 3:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `B# #B`, which matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - Remove `B# #B`.\n   - Sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #A #A #A #B A# B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Step 4:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `#A A#`, which matches the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - Remove `A# #A`.\n   - Sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #A #B A# B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Step 5:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `B# #A`, which matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`.\n   - Rewrite `B# #A` as `#A B#`.\n   - Sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #A #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Step 6:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `B# #B`, which matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - Remove `B# #B`.\n   - Sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #A #A\n     ```\n\n7. **Step 7:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `A# #A`, which matches the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - Remove `A# #A`.\n   - Sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A\n     ```\n\n8. **Step 8:**\n   - The next applicable pair is `A# #A`, which matches the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - Remove `A# #A`.\n   - Sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #B\n     ```\n\nNow, no more rules can be applied, and the sequence is reduced to a single token.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\n#B\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#B>>>"
