    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #B A# A# #A #B #A A# B# #A\n```\n\n1. Identify pairs of neighboring tokens that can be rewritten:\n   - `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - `A# #B` can be rewritten to `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten to nothing.\n\n2. Apply the rules to the sequence:\n\n   - The first pair `#B #B` matches the rule `B# #B` (but reversed), so it becomes nothing. However, since the rule is not directly applicable in this order, we move to the next pair.\n   - The next pair `A# A#` does not match any rule.\n   - The pair `A# #A` matches the rule `A# #A` and becomes nothing. So, we rewrite:\n     ```\n     #B #B A# #B #A A# B# #A\n     ```\n   - Now, the pair `A# #B` matches the rule `A# #B` and becomes `#B A#`. So, we rewrite:\n     ```\n     #B #B #B A# #A A# B# #A\n     ```\n   - The pair `A# #A` matches the rule `A# #A` and becomes nothing. So, we rewrite:\n     ```\n     #B #B #B A# B# #A\n     ```\n   - The pair `A# B#` does not match any rule.\n   - The pair `B# #A` matches the rule `B# #A` and becomes `#A B#`. So, we rewrite:\n     ```\n     #B #B #B #A B#\n     ```\n   - The pair `#B #B` does not match any rule.\n   - The pair `#B #A` does not match any rule.\n   - The pair `#A B#` does not match any rule.\n\n3. No more rules can be applied. The final sequence is:\n```\n#B #B #B #A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n<<<#B #B #B #A B#>>>"
