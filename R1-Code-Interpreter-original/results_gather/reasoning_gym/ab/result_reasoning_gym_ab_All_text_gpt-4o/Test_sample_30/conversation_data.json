    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# A# B# #B #A #A B# B# B# A#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `B# A#` → `B# A#` (no change, as they don't face each other)\n   - `A# B#` → `A# B#` (no change, as they don't face each other)\n   - `B# #B` → `nothing` (apply rule: `B# #B` becomes `nothing`)\n   - `#A #A` → `nothing` (apply rule: `A# #A` becomes `nothing`)\n   - `B# B#` → `B# B#` (no change, as they don't face each other)\n   - `B# A#` → `B# A#` (no change, as they don't face each other)\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\nB# A# B# B# B# A#\n```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# A#` → `B# A#` (no change, as they don't face each other)\n   - `A# B#` → `A# B#` (no change, as they don't face each other)\n   - `B# B#` → `B# B#` (no change, as they don't face each other)\n   - `B# A#` → `B# A#` (no change, as they don't face each other)\n\nNo further changes can be made, as there are no neighboring tokens with `#` facing each other.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\nB# A# B# B# B# A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<B# A# B# B# B# A#>>>"
