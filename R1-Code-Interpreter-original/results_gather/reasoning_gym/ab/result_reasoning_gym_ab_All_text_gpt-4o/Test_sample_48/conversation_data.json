    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A #B #B #A #A #B #A A# #B B#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `#A #B` can be rewritten as `#B A#`.\n   - `#B #A` can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - `A# #A` and `B# #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Start from the left and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rules.\n\n3. **Step-by-step application:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Look at the first two tokens `#A #B`. According to the rule, `#A #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n     ```\n     #B A# #B #A #A #B #A A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 2:** Now, look at the next pair `A# #B`. According to the rule, `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n     ```\n     #B #B A# #A #A #B #A A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 3:** Next, look at `#B #A`. According to the rule, `#B #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n     ```\n     #B #A B# #A #B #A A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 4:** Now, look at `#A #A`. According to the rule, `A# #A` becomes nothing, but here we have `#A #A`, which doesn't match any rule, so we move on.\n\n   - **Step 5:** Look at `B# #A`. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n     ```\n     #B #A #A B# #B #A A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 6:** Now, look at `#A #B`. According to the rule, `#A #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #B A# #A A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 7:** Look at `#B #A`. According to the rule, `#B #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #A B# A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 8:** Now, look at `A# #B`. According to the rule, `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n     ```\n     #B #A #A #A B# #B A# B#\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 9:** Look at `#B #B`. According to the rule, `B# #B` becomes nothing, but here we have `#B #B`, which doesn't match any rule, so we move on.\n\n   - **Step 10:** Look at `A# B#`. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`, but here we have `A# B#`, which doesn't match any rule, so we move on.\n\n4. **Final sequence:**\n   After applying all possible rules, the sequence becomes:\n   ```\n   #B #A #A #A B# A# B#\n   ```\n\nNo more rules can be applied, so this is the final state of the program.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n<<<#B #A #A #A B# A# B#>>>\n```"
