    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A #A #B B# A# #A A# A# B# #B\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - The sequence `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - The sequence `A# #B` can be rewritten to `#B A#`.\n   - The sequence `B# #A` can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n   - The sequence `B# #B` can be rewritten to nothing.\n\n2. **Apply the rules step by step:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Look for applicable rules from left to right.\n     - `#A #A` - No rule applies.\n     - `#A #B` - No rule applies.\n     - `#B B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# A#` - No rule applies.\n     - `A# #A` - Apply the rule: `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n     - New sequence: `#A #A #B B# A# A# A# B# #B`\n\n   - **Step 2:** Continue applying rules.\n     - `#A #A` - No rule applies.\n     - `#A #B` - No rule applies.\n     - `#B B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# A#` - No rule applies.\n     - `A# A#` - No rule applies.\n     - `A# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# #B` - Apply the rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n     - New sequence: `#A #A #B B# A# A# A# B#`\n\n   - **Step 3:** Continue applying rules.\n     - `#A #A` - No rule applies.\n     - `#A #B` - No rule applies.\n     - `#B B#` - No rule applies.\n     - `B# A#` - No rule applies.\n     - `A# A#` - No rule applies.\n     - `A# B#` - No rule applies.\n     - No more applicable rules.\n\n3. **Final sequence:**\n   - The sequence is now stable, and no more rules can be applied.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\n#A #A #B B# A# A# A# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A #A #B B# A# A# A# B#>>>"
