    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# B# B# #A A# B# #A A# #A #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `B# #A` is found at positions 3 and 4. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     A# B# #A B# A# B# #A A# #A #B\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Again, look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `A# #A` is found at positions 1 and 2. According to the rule, `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# A# B# A# B# #A A# #A #B\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `B# #A` is found at positions 2 and 3. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# A# B# #A A# #B\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `B# #A` is found at positions 1 and 2. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# A# B# #A A# #B\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `B# #A` is found at positions 3 and 4. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# B# #A A# #B\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `B# #A` is found at positions 2 and 3. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# B# #A A# #B\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `A# #A` is found at positions 1 and 2. According to the rule, `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# #A A# #B\n     ```\n\n8. **Eighth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `B# #A` is found at positions 3 and 4. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A B# A# #B\n     ```\n\n9. **Ninth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n   - `B# #A` is found at positions 2 and 3. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# B# A# #B\n     ```\n\n10. **Tenth Pass:**\n    - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n    - `B# #A` is found at positions 1 and 2. According to the rule, `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n    - Rewrite the sequence:\n      ```\n      #A B# B# B# A# #B\n      ```\n\n11. **Eleventh Pass:**\n    - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n    - `B# #B` is found at positions 4 and 5. According to the rule, `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n    - Rewrite the sequence:\n      ```\n      #A B# B# A#\n      ```\n\n12. **Twelfth Pass:**\n    - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n    - `A# #A` is found at positions 3 and 4. According to the rule, `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n    - Rewrite the sequence:\n      ```\n      #A B# B#\n      ```\n\n13. **Thirteenth Pass:**\n    - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rewrite rules.\n    - `B# B#` is found at positions 2 and 3. According to the rule, `B# B#` becomes nothing.\n    - Rewrite the sequence:\n      ```\n      #A\n      ```\n\nNo more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n\n<<<#A>>>"
