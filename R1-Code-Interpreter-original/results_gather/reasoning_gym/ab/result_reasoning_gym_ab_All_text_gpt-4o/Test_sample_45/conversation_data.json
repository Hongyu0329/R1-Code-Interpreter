    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\n#A #A B# B# B# A# #A #B B# B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A B#` does not match any rule.\n   - `B# B#` matches the rule `B# B#` becomes nothing. Remove `B# B#`.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A B# A# #A #B B# B#`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A B#` does not match any rule.\n   - `B# A#` matches the rule `B# A#` becomes `#A B#`. Replace `B# A#` with `#A B#`.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A #A B# #A #B B# B#`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A B#` does not match any rule.\n   - `B# #A` matches the rule `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A #A #A B# #B B# B#`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A B#` does not match any rule.\n   - `B# #B` matches the rule `B# #B` becomes nothing. Remove `B# #B`.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A #A #A B# B#`\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A B#` does not match any rule.\n   - `B# B#` matches the rule `B# B#` becomes nothing. Remove `B# B#`.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A #A #A`\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n   - No more rules can be applied.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A #A #A #A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A #A #A #A>>>"
