    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# A# A# A# #A B# #B B# #A #A\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. We find this pattern between the 4th and 5th tokens.\n   - After applying the rule: \n     ```\n     A# A# A# B# #B B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing. We find this pattern between the 4th and 5th tokens.\n   - After applying the rule:\n     ```\n     A# A# A# B# B# #A #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find this pattern between the 4th and 5th tokens.\n   - After applying the rule:\n     ```\n     A# A# A# #A B# B# #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. We find this pattern between the 3rd and 4th tokens.\n   - After applying the rule:\n     ```\n     A# A# B# B# #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find this pattern between the 3rd and 4th tokens.\n   - After applying the rule:\n     ```\n     A# A# #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. We find this pattern between the 2nd and 3rd tokens.\n   - After applying the rule:\n     ```\n     A# B# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - No more patterns match the rules, so the sequence remains unchanged.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\nA# B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n<<<A# B# B#>>>\n```"
