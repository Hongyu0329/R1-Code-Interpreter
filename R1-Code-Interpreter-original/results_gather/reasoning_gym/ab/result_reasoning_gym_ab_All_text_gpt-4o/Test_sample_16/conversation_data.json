    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A B# #A B# #B B# B# A# #B B#\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# #B B# B# A# #B B#\n         ^^^\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# #B B# B# A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# #B B# B# A# #B B#\n     ^^\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     B# B# #B B# B# A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     B# B# #B B# B# A# #B B#\n         ^^^\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# B# A# #B B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# B# A# #B B#\n                 ^^^\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# #A B# #B B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# #A B# #B B#\n                     ^^^\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     B# B# B# #A B# B#\n             ^^^\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A B# B# B#\n         ^^^\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n8. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# B# B# B#\n     ^^^\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# B# B# B#\n     ```\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied because there are no adjacent tokens with `#` facing each other. Therefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A B# B# B# B# B#\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<#A B# B# B# B# B#>>>"
