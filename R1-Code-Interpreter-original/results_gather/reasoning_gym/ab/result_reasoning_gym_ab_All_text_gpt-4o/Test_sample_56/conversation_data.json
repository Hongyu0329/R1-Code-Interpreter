    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\n#B B# #A B# A# A# #A #B B# B#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens where the '#' symbols are facing each other.\n   - Apply the rules in the order they appear from left to right.\n\n2. **First pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\n3. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `#B B# #A` becomes `#B #A B#`\n   - `B# A# A# #A` becomes `B# A#`\n   - `#B B# B#` becomes `#B`\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #A B# A# #B\n```\n\n4. **Second pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n\n5. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `#B #A B#` becomes `#B #A B#`\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #A B# #B A#\n```\n\n6. **Third pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\n7. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `#B #A` remains `#B #A`\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n   - `A#` remains `A#`\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #A A#\n```\n\n8. **Fourth pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing\n\n9. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `#B #A` remains `#B #A`\n   - `A#` remains `A#`\n\nAfter applying the rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B #A\n```\n\n10. **Final pass:**\n    - No more applicable rules.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B #A>>>"
