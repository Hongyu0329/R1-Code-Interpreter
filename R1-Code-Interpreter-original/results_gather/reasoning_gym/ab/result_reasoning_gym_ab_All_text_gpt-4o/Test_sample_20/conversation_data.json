    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A A# #B #A #B A# B# B# #B B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\nLet's apply these rules to the sequence:\n\n- `#A A#` - No rule applies here.\n- `A# #B` - Apply rule: becomes `#B A#`\n- `#B #A` - No rule applies here.\n- `#A #B` - No rule applies here.\n- `#B A#` - No rule applies here.\n- `A# B#` - No rule applies here.\n- `B# B#` - No rule applies here.\n- `B# #B` - Apply rule: becomes nothing\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#A #B A# #A #B A# B# B#\n```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\nApply these rules again:\n\n- `#A #B` - No rule applies here.\n- `#B A#` - No rule applies here.\n- `A# #A` - Apply rule: becomes nothing\n- `#B A#` - No rule applies here.\n- `A# B#` - No rule applies here.\n- `B# B#` - No rule applies here.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#A #B #B A# B# B#\n```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\nApply these rules again:\n\n- `#A #B` - No rule applies here.\n- `#B #B` - Apply rule: becomes nothing\n- `A# B#` - No rule applies here.\n- `B# B#` - No rule applies here.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the sequence becomes:\n```\n#A A# B# B#\n```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\nApply these rules again:\n\n- `#A A#` - No rule applies here.\n- `A# B#` - No rule applies here.\n- `B# B#` - No rule applies here.\n\nNo more rules can be applied, so the sequence remains:\n```\n#A A# B# B#\n```\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A A# B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A A# B# B#>>>"
