    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #A #B #B A# #A B# #A B# #A\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - The sequence `A# #A` appears as `A# #A` in the sequence.\n   - The sequence `B# #A` appears as `B# #A` in the sequence.\n   - The sequence `B# #B` appears as `#B #B` in the sequence.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n\n3. **Step-by-step application:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Apply `B# #B` rule:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B #B A# #A B# #A B# #A\n     #B #A #B     A# #A B# #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 2:** Apply `A# #A` rule:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B     A# #A B# #A B# #A\n     #B #A #B         B# #A B# #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 3:** Apply `B# #A` rule:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B         B# #A B# #A\n     #B #A #B         #A B# B# #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 4:** Apply `B# #B` rule:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B         #A B# B# #A\n     #B #A #B         #A     #A\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 5:** Apply `A# #A` rule:\n     ```\n     #B #A #B         #A     #A\n     #B #A #B         #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Final sequence:**\n   ```\n   #B #A #B #A\n   ```\n\nNo more rules can be applied, so the final state of the program is:\n\n<<<#B #A #B #A>>>"
