    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\nB# #A A# #A B# #B B# A# #A #B\n```\n\n1. **Apply B# #A → #A B#:**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A` and replace it with `#A B#`.\n   - Sequence becomes: `#A B# A# #A B# #B B# A# #A #B`\n\n2. **Apply A# #A → nothing:**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A` and remove it.\n   - Sequence becomes: `#A B# B# #B B# A# #A #B`\n\n3. **Apply B# #B → nothing:**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B` and remove it.\n   - Sequence becomes: `#A B# B# B# A# #A #B`\n\n4. **Apply B# #A → #A B#:**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A` and replace it with `#A B#`.\n   - Sequence becomes: `#A B# B# #A B# #B`\n\n5. **Apply B# #B → nothing:**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B` and remove it.\n   - Sequence becomes: `#A B# B# #A B#`\n\n6. **Apply B# #A → #A B#:**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A` and replace it with `#A B#`.\n   - Sequence becomes: `#A B# #A B# B#`\n\n7. **Apply A# #A → nothing:**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A` and remove it.\n   - Sequence becomes: `#A B# B#`\n\n8. **Apply B# #B → nothing:**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B` and remove it.\n   - Sequence becomes: `#A B#`\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied because there are no neighboring tokens with their `#` facing each other. Therefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A B#\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B#>>>"
