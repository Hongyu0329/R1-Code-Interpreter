    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# B# #A B# #A B# #A A# A# B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that can be rewritten according to the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# B# #A B# #A B# #A A# A# B#\n     B# #A B# #A B# #A A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Again, look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - The first pair is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# #A B# #A A# A# B#\n     #A B# B# #A B# #A A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #A B# #A A# A# B#\n     #A #A B# B# #A A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `#A A#`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# #A A# A# B#\n     #A B# B# #A A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #A A# A# B#\n     #A B# #A B# A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# A# A# B#\n     #A #A B# B# A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `#A A#`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# A# A# B#\n     #A B# B# A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n8. **Eighth Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `B# A#`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# A# A# B#\n     #A B# A# B#\n     ```\n\n9. **Ninth Pass:**\n   - The first pair is `B# A#`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# A# B#\n     #A B#\n     ```\n\n10. **Tenth Pass:**\n    - No more pairs can be rewritten according to the rules.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B#>>>"
