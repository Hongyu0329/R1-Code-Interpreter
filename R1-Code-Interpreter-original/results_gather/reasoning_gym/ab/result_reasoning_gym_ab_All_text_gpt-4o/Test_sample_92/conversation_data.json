    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\n#A A# B# A# #B #A #A A# #A B#\n```\n\n1. Identify pairs of neighboring tokens that can be rewritten:\n   - `A# #A` at positions 2 and 3\n   - `B# #A` at positions 4 and 5\n   - `A# #B` at positions 6 and 7\n   - `A# #A` at positions 8 and 9\n\n2. Apply the rewriting rules:\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing, so remove `A# #A` at positions 2 and 3:\n     ```\n     #A B# A# #B #A #A A# #A B#\n     ```\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`, so replace `B# #A` at positions 3 and 4:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# A# #B #A A# #A B#\n     ```\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`, so replace `A# #B` at positions 5 and 6:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# #B A# #A A# #A B#\n     ```\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing, so remove `A# #A` at positions 7 and 8:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# #B A# A# B#\n     ```\n\n3. Repeat the process until no more rewrites are possible:\n   - `A# #A` at positions 5 and 6 can be removed:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# #B B#\n     ```\n   - `B# #B` at positions 3 and 4 can be removed:\n     ```\n     #A #A B#\n     ```\n\n4. No more rewrites are possible. The final state of the program is:\n```\n#A #A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A #A B#>>>"
