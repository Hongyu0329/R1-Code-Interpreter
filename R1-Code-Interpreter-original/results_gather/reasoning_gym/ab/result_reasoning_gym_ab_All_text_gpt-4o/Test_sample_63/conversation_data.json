    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# #B A# B# A# A# #A B# A# B#\n```\n\n1. **Apply the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`:**\n   - The first two tokens `B# #B` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New program: `A# B# A# A# #A B# A# B#`\n\n2. **Apply the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`:**\n   - The tokens `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New program: `A# B# A# B# A# B#`\n\n3. **Apply the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`:**\n   - The tokens `B# A#` can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n   - New program: `A# #A B# A# B#`\n\n4. **Apply the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`:**\n   - The tokens `A# #A` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New program: `B# A# B#`\n\n5. **Apply the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`:**\n   - The tokens `B# A#` can be rewritten to `#A B#`.\n   - New program: `#A B# B#`\n\n6. **Apply the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`:**\n   - The tokens `B# B#` can be rewritten to nothing.\n   - New program: `#A`\n\nNow, no more rules can be applied as there are no neighboring tokens with their '#' facing each other. Therefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A>>>"
