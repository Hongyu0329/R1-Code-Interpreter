    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\nB# #A B# B# #B #A #B A# B# #B\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule 3 (B# #A becomes #A B#):**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     B# #A B# B# #B #A #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# B# #B #A #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule 3 (B# #A becomes #A B#):**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #B #A #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# #B #A #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule 1 (A# #A becomes nothing):**\n   - Find the occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# #B #A #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #B #A #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3 (B# #A becomes #A B#):**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #B #A #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule 1 (A# #A becomes nothing):**\n   - Find the occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n\n6. **Apply Rule 3 (B# #A becomes #A B#):**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# A# B# #B\n     ```\n\n7. **Apply Rule 1 (A# #A becomes nothing):**\n   - Find the occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# A# B# #B\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# B# #B\n     ```\n\n8. **Apply Rule 4 (B# #B becomes nothing):**\n   - Find the occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# B# #B\n     ```\n   - Apply the rule:\n     ```\n     #A B# B#\n     ```\n\nNow, no more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B# B#>>>"
