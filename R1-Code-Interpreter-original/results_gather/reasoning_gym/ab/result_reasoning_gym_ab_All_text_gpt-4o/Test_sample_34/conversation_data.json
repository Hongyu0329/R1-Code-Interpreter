    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. We will go through the sequence step by step, applying the rules until no more rewrites are possible.\n\nGiven program:  \nA# #A #B B# #B #A #A A# #B B#\n\nLet's apply the rules:\n\n1. **A# #A**: According to the rule, this becomes nothing.  \n   New sequence: #B B# #B #A #A A# #B B#\n\n2. **B# #B**: According to the rule, this becomes nothing.  \n   New sequence: #B #A #A A# #B B#\n\n3. **#A A#**: According to the rule, this becomes nothing.  \n   New sequence: #B #A #B B#\n\n4. **B# #B**: According to the rule, this becomes nothing.  \n   New sequence: #B #A\n\nNow, no more rewrites are possible because there are no neighboring tokens with their '#' facing each other.\n\nThe final state of the program is:  \n#B #A\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:  \n<<<#B #A>>>"
