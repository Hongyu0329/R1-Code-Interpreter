    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# #B B# B# #B #B B# B# B# #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that can be rewritten according to the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `A# #B`, which becomes `#B A#`.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #B A# B# B# #B #B B# B# B# #B\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Next, look for another pair. The first pair that matches is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #B A# B# #B #B B# B# B# #B\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Again, look for pairs. The first pair that matches is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #B A# #B #B B# B# B# #B\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs. The first pair that matches is `A# #B`, which becomes `#B A#`.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #B #B A# #B B# B# B# #B\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs. The first pair that matches is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #B #B A# B# B# #B\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs. The first pair that matches is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #B #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs. The first pair that matches is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite the program:\n     ```\n     #B #B A#\n     ```\n\n8. **Eighth Pass:**\n   - No more pairs can be rewritten according to the rules.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #B A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B #B A#>>>"
