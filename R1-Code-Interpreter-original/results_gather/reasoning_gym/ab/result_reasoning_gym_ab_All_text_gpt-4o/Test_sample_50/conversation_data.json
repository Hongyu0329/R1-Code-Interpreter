    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# #B #A B# B# #A B# A# #B #B\n```\n\n1. **Step 1: Apply the rules from left to right.**\n\n   - The first two tokens are `B# #B`. According to the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`, these two tokens are removed.\n   - New sequence: `#A B# B# #A B# A# #B #B`\n\n2. **Step 2: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n   - The next two tokens are `#A B#`. According to the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`, these tokens remain unchanged.\n   - New sequence: `#A B# B# #A B# A# #B #B`\n\n3. **Step 3: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n   - The next two tokens are `B# B#`. According to the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`, these tokens remain unchanged.\n   - New sequence: `#A B# B# #A B# A# #B #B`\n\n4. **Step 4: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n   - The next two tokens are `B# #A`. According to the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`, these tokens are rewritten.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A B# B# A# #B #B`\n\n5. **Step 5: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n   - The next two tokens are `#A B#`. According to the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`, these tokens remain unchanged.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A B# B# A# #B #B`\n\n6. **Step 6: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n   - The next two tokens are `B# A#`. According to the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`, these tokens remain unchanged.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A B# B# A# #B #B`\n\n7. **Step 7: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n   - The next two tokens are `A# #B`. According to the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`, these tokens are rewritten.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A B# B# #B A# B#`\n\n8. **Step 8: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n   - The next two tokens are `B# #B`. According to the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`, these tokens are removed.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A B# A# B#`\n\n9. **Step 9: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n   - The next two tokens are `A# B#`. According to the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`, these tokens remain unchanged.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A B# A# B#`\n\n10. **Step 10: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n    - The next two tokens are `B# A#`. According to the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`, these tokens remain unchanged.\n    - New sequence: `#A #A B# A# B#`\n\n11. **Step 11: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n    - The next two tokens are `A# B#`. According to the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`, these tokens remain unchanged.\n    - New sequence: `#A #A B# A# B#`\n\n12. **Step 12: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n    - The next two tokens are `B# A#`. According to the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`, these tokens remain unchanged.\n    - New sequence: `#A #A B# A# B#`\n\n13. **Step 13: Continue applying the rules.**\n\n    - The next two tokens are `A# B#`.
