    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# #A #B A# B# B# #B A# #A #A\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - New sequence: `#A B# #B A# B# B# #B A# #A #A`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n   - New sequence: `#A A# B# B# #B A# #A #A`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `#A A#` becomes nothing\n   - New sequence: `B# B# #B A# #A #A`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n   - New sequence: `B# A# #A #A`\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing\n   - New sequence: `B# #A #A`\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - `#A #A` does not match any rule, so it remains unchanged.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\nB# #A #A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B# #A #A>>>"
