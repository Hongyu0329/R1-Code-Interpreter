    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A #A B# #A B# #B #B #A A# A#\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# #A B# #B #B #A A#\n           ^^^^\n     ```\n   - Rewrite it as `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# B# #B #B #A A#\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# B# #B #B #A A#\n               ^^^^^^\n     ```\n   - Remove it:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# #B #A A#\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule: B# #B becomes nothing**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `B# #B`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# #B #A A#\n               ^^^^^^\n     ```\n   - Remove it:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A #A A#\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A #A A#\n               ^^^^^\n     ```\n   - Remove it:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A\n         ^^^^^\n     ```\n   - Remove it:\n     ```\n     #A\n     ```\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied, and we have reached the final state of the program.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\n#A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A>>>"
