    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# A# #A B# B# #B #A B# #B B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. We find `A# #A` between the second and third tokens.\n   - Rewrite: `B#` (nothing) `B# B# #B #A B# #B B#`\n   - Result: `B# B# B# #B #A B# #B B#`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` between the fourth and fifth tokens.\n   - Rewrite: `B# B# B# #A B# B# #B B#`\n   - Result: `B# B# B# #A B# B# #B B#`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing. We find `B# #B` between the sixth and seventh tokens.\n   - Rewrite: `B# B# B# #A B#` (nothing) `B#`\n   - Result: `B# B# B# #A B# B#`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` between the fourth and fifth tokens.\n   - Rewrite: `B# B# B# #A B# B#`\n   - Result: `B# B# B# #A B# B#`\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing. We find `B# #B` between the fifth and sixth tokens.\n   - Rewrite: `B# B# B# #A` (nothing)\n   - Result: `B# B# B# #A`\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` between the third and fourth tokens.\n   - Rewrite: `B# B# #A B#`\n   - Result: `B# B# #A B#`\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` between the second and third tokens.\n   - Rewrite: `B# #A B# B#`\n   - Result: `B# #A B# B#`\n\n8. **Eighth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. We find `B# #A` between the first and second tokens.\n   - Rewrite: `#A B# B# B#`\n   - Result: `#A B# B# B#`\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied because there are no neighboring tokens with their '#' facing each other.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\n#A B# B# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B# B# B#>>>"
