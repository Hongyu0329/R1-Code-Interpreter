    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\nB# B# #A #B B# #A #B #B #A A#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `B# B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #A B# #B B# #A #B #B #A A#`\n   - `#A B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# #B` → Apply rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing\n     - New sequence: `B# #A B# B# #A #B #B #A A#`\n   - `B# B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #A B# #A B# #B #A A#`\n   - `#A B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# #B` → Apply rule: `B# #B` becomes nothing\n     - New sequence: `B# #A B# #A A#`\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - New sequence: `B# #A #A B# A#`\n   - `#A #A` → No rule applies.\n   - `#A B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# A#` → No rule applies.\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - New sequence: `#A B# #A B# A#`\n   - `#A B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# #A` → Apply rule: `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n     - New sequence: `#A #A B# B# A#`\n   - `#A #A` → No rule applies.\n   - `#A B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# A#` → No rule applies.\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `#A #A` → No rule applies.\n   - `#A B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# B#` → No rule applies.\n   - `B# A#` → No rule applies.\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied, and the sequence is stable.\n\nFinal sequence:\n```\n#A #A B# B# A#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final state of the program is:\n\n<<<#A #A B# B# A#>>>"
