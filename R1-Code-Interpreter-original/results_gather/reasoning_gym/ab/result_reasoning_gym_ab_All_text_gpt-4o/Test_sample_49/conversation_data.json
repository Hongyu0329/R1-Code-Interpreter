    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B #A #B #B A# B# B# #B A# #A\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `#B #A` can be rewritten using the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`.\n   - `#B #B` can be rewritten using the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`.\n   - `A# #A` can be rewritten using the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - The first applicable pair is `#B #A`, which can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #A B# #B #B A# B# B# #B A# #A\n     ```\n\n3. **Continue applying rules:**\n   - Now, `B# #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #A #B A# B# B# #B A# #A\n     ```\n\n4. **Continue applying rules:**\n   - Again, `B# #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #A #B A# B# A# #A\n     ```\n\n5. **Continue applying rules:**\n   - Now, `A# #A` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #A #B A# B#\n     ```\n\n6. **Continue applying rules:**\n   - Now, `A# B#` can be rewritten as `#B A#`.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #A #B #B A#\n     ```\n\n7. **Continue applying rules:**\n   - Now, `#B #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #A A#\n     ```\n\n8. **Continue applying rules:**\n   - Finally, `A# #A` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - The sequence becomes:\n     ```\n     #A\n     ```\n\nNo more rules can be applied, so the final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A>>>"
