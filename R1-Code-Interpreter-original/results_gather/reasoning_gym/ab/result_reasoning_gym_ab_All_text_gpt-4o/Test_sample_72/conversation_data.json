    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# B# B# #B #A A# B# A# B# A#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that can be rewritten according to the rules.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `B# #B`. According to the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`, we remove these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `A# B# #A A# B# A# B# A#`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Again, look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `A# #A`. According to the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`, we remove these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `A# B# A# B# A#`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `B# A#`. According to the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`, we rewrite these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `A# #A B# A#`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `A# #A`. According to the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`, we remove these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `B# A#`\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - The pair `B# A#` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`, so we rewrite these tokens.\n   - New sequence: `#A B#`\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - Look for pairs that can be rewritten.\n   - There are no pairs left that match any of the rules.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A B#>>>"
