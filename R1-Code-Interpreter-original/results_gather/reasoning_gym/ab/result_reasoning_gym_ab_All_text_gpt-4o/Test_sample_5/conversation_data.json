    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# A# #A #B A# #B #A #B #B #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. Remove `A# #A` from the sequence.\n   - The sequence becomes: `A# #B A# #B #A #B #B #B`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`. Replace `A# #B` with `#B A#`.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B A# A# #B #A #B #B #B`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`. Replace `A# #B` with `#B A#`.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #B A# A# #A #B #B #B`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing. Remove `B# #B` from the sequence.\n   - The sequence becomes: `A# A# #A #B #B #B`\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing. Remove `A# #A` from the sequence.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B #B #B`\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing. Remove `B# #B` from the sequence.\n   - The sequence becomes: `#B`\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied because there are no neighboring tokens with their '#' facing each other.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#B>>>"
