    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# #A #B #B B# #A A# B# B# #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing`. Remove these two tokens.\n   - New sequence: `#B #B B# #A A# B# B# #B`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. Replace these two tokens.\n   - New sequence: `#B #B #A B# A# B# B# #B`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `A# B#` becomes `#A B#`. Replace these two tokens.\n   - New sequence: `#B #B #A #A B# B# #B`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `#A #A` becomes `nothing`. Remove these two tokens.\n   - New sequence: `#B #B B# B# #B`\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `B# B#` becomes `nothing`. Remove these two tokens.\n   - New sequence: `#B #B #B`\n\n6. **Final Pass:**\n   - No more applicable rules. The sequence remains unchanged.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #B #B\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n<<<#B #B #B>>>\n```"
