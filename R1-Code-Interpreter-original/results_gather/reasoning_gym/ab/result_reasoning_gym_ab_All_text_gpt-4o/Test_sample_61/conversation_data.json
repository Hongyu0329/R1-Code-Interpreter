    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\n#B #A A# A# #A B# B# #B A# B#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `#A A#` becomes `nothing` (Rule: A# #A)\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing` (Rule: A# #A)\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (Rule: B# #B)\n\nAfter applying these rules, the program becomes:\n```\n#B B# #B A# B#\n```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing` (Rule: B# #B)\n\nAfter applying this rule, the program becomes:\n```\n#B A# B#\n```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - No applicable rules for `#B A# B#` since no neighboring tokens have their '#' facing each other.\n\nThe program is now in its final state, as no further rules can be applied.\n\nFinal state of the program:\n```\n#B A# B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B A# B#>>>"
