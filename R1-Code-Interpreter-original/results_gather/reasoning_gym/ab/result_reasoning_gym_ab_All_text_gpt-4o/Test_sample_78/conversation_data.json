    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#B B# #B #B #A A# #B #A A# A#\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - `B# #A` can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - `A# #B` can be rewritten as `#B A#`.\n   - `A# #A` can be rewritten as nothing.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rules and apply them.\n\n**Step 1:**\n- `#B B#` (no rule applies here)\n- `B# #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n- `#A A#` (no rule applies here)\n- `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n- `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n- `#A A#` becomes nothing\n\nAfter applying the rules:\n```\n#B B# #B #B #A #B A# #B #A\n```\n\n**Step 2:**\n- `#B B#` (no rule applies here)\n- `B# #B` becomes nothing\n- `#B #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n- `#A #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B A#` (no rule applies here)\n- `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n- `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n\nAfter applying the rules:\n```\n#B #B #B #A #B A# #B A#\n```\n\n**Step 3:**\n- `#B #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n- `#A #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B A#` (no rule applies here)\n- `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n- `#B A#` (no rule applies here)\n\nAfter applying the rules:\n```\n#B #B #B #A #B #B A# A#\n```\n\n**Step 4:**\n- `#B #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #A` (no rule applies here)\n- `#A #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B #B` (no rule applies here)\n- `#B A#` (no rule applies here)\n- `A# A#` becomes nothing\n\nAfter applying the rules:\n```\n#B #B #B #A #B #B\n```\n\nNo more rules can be applied.
