    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# #B #A B# #B A# B# #A #A #A\n```\n\n1. **Step 1:**\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that can be rewritten.\n   - The first pair that matches a rule is `B# #B`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite: `#A B# #B A# B# #A #A #A`\n\n2. **Step 2:**\n   - The next pair is `B# #B`, which again becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite: `#A A# B# #A #A #A`\n\n3. **Step 3:**\n   - The next pair is `#A A#`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite: `B# #A #A #A`\n\n4. **Step 4:**\n   - The next pair is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite: `#A B# #A #A`\n\n5. **Step 5:**\n   - The next pair is `B# #A`, which becomes `#A B#`.\n   - Rewrite: `#A #A B#`\n\n6. **Step 6:**\n   - The next pair is `#A A#`, which becomes nothing.\n   - Rewrite: `B#`\n\nAt this point, no more rules can be applied because there are no neighboring tokens with their '#' facing each other. The final state of the program is:\n\n```\nB#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B#>>>"
