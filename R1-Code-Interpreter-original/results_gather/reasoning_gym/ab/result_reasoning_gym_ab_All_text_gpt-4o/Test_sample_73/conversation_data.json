    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A A# A# #A #A #A B# #A B# B#\n```\n\n1. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the first occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A (A# #A) #A #A B# #A B# B#\n     ```\n   - Remove `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A #A #A B# #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the next occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A (A# #A) B# #A B# B#\n     ```\n   - Remove `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply Rule: B# #A becomes #A B#**\n   - Find the occurrence of `B# #A`:\n     ```\n     #A (B# #A) B# B#\n     ```\n   - Replace `B# #A` with `#A B#`:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Apply Rule: A# #A becomes nothing**\n   - Find the occurrence of `A# #A`:\n     ```\n     (#A #A) B# B# B#\n     ```\n   - Remove `#A #A`:\n     ```\n     B# B# B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Apply Rule: B# B# becomes nothing**\n   - Find the occurrence of `B# B#`:\n     ```\n     (B# B#) B#\n     ```\n   - Remove `B# B#`:\n     ```\n     B#\n     ```\n\nNow, no more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n\n```\nB#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B#>>>"
