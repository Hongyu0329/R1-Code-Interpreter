    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nB# A# #A #A #B A# B# #B B# #B\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# A# #A #A #B A# B# #B B# #B\n     B#      #A #B A# B# #B B# #B\n     ```\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     B# #A #B A# B# #B B# #B\n     #A B# #B A# B# #B B# #B\n     ```\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# #B A# B# #B B# #B\n     #A B# A# B# #B B# #B\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# A# B# #B B# #B\n     #A B# #B A# B# #B\n     ```\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# #B A# B# #B\n     #A B# A# B#\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# A# B#\n     #A B# #B A#\n     ```\n   - `B# #B` becomes `nothing`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# #B A#\n     #A B# A#\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A B# A#\n     #A #A B#\n     ```\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing`. Apply this to the sequence:\n     ```\n     #A #A B#\n     #A B#\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - No more rules can be applied.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#A B#>>>"
