    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens in the program. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\nInitial program:\n```\nA# #B A# B# B# A# A# A# #A A#\n```\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B A# A# B# B# A# A# A# #A A#\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - `A# B#` becomes `#A B#`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B A# #A B# B# A# A# A# #A A#\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - `B# B#` becomes `nothing`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B A# #A B# A# A# A# #A A#\n     ```\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B B# A# A# A# #A A#\n     ```\n\n5. **Fifth Pass:**\n   - `B# A#` becomes `#A B#`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A B# A# A# #A A#\n     ```\n\n6. **Sixth Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A B# A# A#\n     ```\n\n7. **Seventh Pass:**\n   - `B# A#` becomes `#A B#`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A #A B# A#\n     ```\n\n8. **Eighth Pass:**\n   - `A# #A` becomes `nothing`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A B#\n     ```\n\n9. **Ninth Pass:**\n   - `B# B#` becomes `nothing`\n   - The program becomes:\n     ```\n     #B #A\n     ```\n\n10. **Tenth Pass:**\n    - No more applicable rules.\n\nThe final state of the program is:\n```\n#B #A\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<#B #A>>>"
