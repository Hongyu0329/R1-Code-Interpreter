    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nInitial sequence:\n```\n#A B# #B A# A# #B B# B# #A #A\n```\n\n1. **Identify applicable rules:**\n   - `B# #B` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - `A# #A` can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - `A# #B` can be rewritten as `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n\n2. **Apply the rules:**\n   - Start from the left and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rules.\n\n3. **First pass:**\n   - `B# #B` at positions 2 and 3 can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#A A# A# #B B# B# #A #A`\n\n4. **Second pass:**\n   - `A# #A` at positions 2 and 3 can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#A A# #B B# B# #A #A`\n\n5. **Third pass:**\n   - `B# #B` at positions 4 and 5 can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#A A# #B B# #A #A`\n\n6. **Fourth pass:**\n   - `B# #A` at positions 3 and 4 can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - New sequence: `#A A# #A B# #A`\n\n7. **Fifth pass:**\n   - `A# #A` at positions 2 and 3 can be rewritten as nothing.\n   - New sequence: `#A B# #A`\n\n8. **Sixth pass:**\n   - `B# #A` at positions 1 and 2 can be rewritten as `#A B#`.\n   - New sequence: `#A #A B#`\n\n9. **Seventh pass:**\n   - `#A #A` at positions 0 and 1 cannot be rewritten as they do not match any rule.\n   - `#A B#` at positions 1 and 2 cannot be rewritten as they do not match any rule.\n\nNo more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A #A B#\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<#A #A B#>>>"
