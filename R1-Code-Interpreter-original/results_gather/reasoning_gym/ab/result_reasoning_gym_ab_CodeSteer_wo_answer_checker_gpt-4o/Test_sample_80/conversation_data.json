    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens to see if they match any of the rules. If they do, we'll apply the rule and continue the process until no more rules can be applied.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Create a loop that will continue until no more changes can be made to the program.\n3. In each iteration, check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. Apply the appropriate rule if a pair matches one of the given rules.\n5. If a rule is applied, update the program and restart the loop.\n6. Once no more rules can be applied, print the final state of the program.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(program):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(program) - 1:\n        if program[i] == 'A#' and program[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # A# #A becomes nothing\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to recheck\n        elif program[i] == 'A#' and program[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # A# #B becomes #B A#\n            program[i], program[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # B# #A becomes #A B#\n            program[i], program[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # B# #B becomes nothing\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to recheck\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return program\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['#B', '#A', '#B', '#B', 'B#', '#A', 'B#', '#B', 'A#', '#B']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rewriting process and output the final state of the program in the required format."
