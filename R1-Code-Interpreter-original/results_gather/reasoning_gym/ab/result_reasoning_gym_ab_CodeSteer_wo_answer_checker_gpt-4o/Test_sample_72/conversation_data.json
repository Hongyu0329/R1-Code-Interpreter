    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens, and apply the appropriate rewriting rule. We'll continue this process until no more rewrites can be applied.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Create a loop that will continue until no changes are made in a full pass through the list.\n3. In each pass, iterate through the list of tokens:\n   - Check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n   - Apply the appropriate rewriting rule based on the pair.\n   - If a rewrite occurs, update the list and mark that a change was made.\n4. Once a full pass is made without any changes, the program is in its final state.\n5. Convert the list of tokens back into a string and print the result in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(program):\n    tokens = program.split()\n    changed = True\n\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # A# #A becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # A# #B becomes #B A#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n                i += 1\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # B# #A becomes #A B#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n                i += 1\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # B# #B becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n    return ' '.join(tokens)\n\nprogram = \"A# B# B# #B #A A# B# A# B# A#\"\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after all possible rewrites have been applied."
