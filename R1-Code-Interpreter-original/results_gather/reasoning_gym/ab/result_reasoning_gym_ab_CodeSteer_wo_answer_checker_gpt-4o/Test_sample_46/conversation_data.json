    "To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate over the sequence and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n3. Apply the appropriate rewrite rule to each pair:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, swap them to `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, swap them to `#A B#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n4. Continue iterating over the sequence and applying rules until no more changes can be made.\n5. Output the final sequence of tokens.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to recheck after removal\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to recheck after removal\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['B#', 'A#', '#A', '#A', '#B', 'A#', 'B#', '#B', 'B#', '#B']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the final state of the program and print it in the required format."
