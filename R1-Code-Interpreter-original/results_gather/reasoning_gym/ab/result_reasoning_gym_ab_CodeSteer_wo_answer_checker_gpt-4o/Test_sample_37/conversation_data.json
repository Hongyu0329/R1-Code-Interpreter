    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate over the sequence of tokens and apply the rules until no more changes can be made. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate over the sequence and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n3. Apply the rewriting rules to each pair:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, swap them to `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, swap them to `#A B#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n4. Continue iterating over the sequence until no more changes can be made.\n5. Output the final state of the program in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to recheck\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # Swap them to #B A#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # Swap them to #A B#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to recheck\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['A#', 'A#', 'B#', 'A#', '#A', '#A', '#B', '#B', '#B', '#B']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after applying all the rewriting rules."
