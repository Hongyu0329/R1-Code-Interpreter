    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the given sequence of tokens according to the specified rules. We'll iterate through the sequence, checking each pair of neighboring tokens, and apply the appropriate rule. We'll continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the sequence of tokens.\n2. Create a loop that will continue until no changes are made in a full pass through the sequence.\n3. In each pass, iterate through the sequence and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. Apply the appropriate rule based on the pair of tokens:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A` or `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, swap them to `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, swap them to `#A B#`.\n5. If any changes are made, start a new pass through the sequence.\n6. Once no more changes can be made, output the final sequence.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    tokens = tokens.split()\n    changed = True\n\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # A# #A becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # A# #B becomes #B A#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n                i += 1\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # B# #A becomes #A B#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n                i += 1\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # B# #B becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n    return ' '.join(tokens)\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = \"B# B# #A B# #A B# #A A# A# B#\"\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after applying all possible rewriting rules.",
