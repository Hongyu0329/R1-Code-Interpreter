    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens and apply the rules until no more rewrites are possible. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Create a loop that continues until no more changes can be made to the program.\n3. In each iteration, check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. Apply the appropriate rewrite rule based on the pair of tokens.\n5. If a rewrite occurs, update the program and restart the loop.\n6. If no rewrites occur in an iteration, the program is in its final state.\n7. Convert the final list of tokens back into a string and output it in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(program):\n    tokens = program.split()\n    changed = True\n\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            pair = (tokens[i], tokens[i + 1])\n            if pair == ('A#', '#A'):\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            elif pair == ('A#', '#B'):\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n                i += 1\n                changed = True\n            elif pair == ('B#', '#A'):\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n                i += 1\n                changed = True\n            elif pair == ('B#', '#B'):\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n    return ' '.join(tokens)\n\nprogram = \"A# A# #A B# B# B# A# A# #B A#\"\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after all possible rewrites have been applied."
