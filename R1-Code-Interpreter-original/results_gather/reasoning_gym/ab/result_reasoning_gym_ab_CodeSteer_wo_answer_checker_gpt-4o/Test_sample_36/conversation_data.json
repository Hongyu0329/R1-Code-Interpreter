    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the given sequence of tokens according to the specified rules. We'll iterate through the sequence, checking each pair of neighboring tokens, and apply the appropriate rule. We'll continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate through the sequence and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n3. Apply the rewriting rules:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A` or `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, replace it with `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, replace it with `#A B#`.\n4. Repeat the process until no more changes can be made.\n5. Output the final sequence of tokens.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == \"A#\" and tokens[i + 1] == \"#A\":\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif tokens[i] == \"B#\" and tokens[i + 1] == \"#B\":\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif tokens[i] == \"A#\" and tokens[i + 1] == \"#B\":\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = \"#B\", \"A#\"\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == \"B#\" and tokens[i + 1] == \"#A\":\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = \"#A\", \"B#\"\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = [\"#B\", \"A#\", \"B#\", \"#B\", \"#B\", \"#A\", \"#A\", \"#B\", \"#A\", \"B#\"]\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after applying all possible rewriting rules."
