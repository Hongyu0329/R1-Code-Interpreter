    "To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate over the sequence and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n3. Apply the appropriate rewrite rule to each pair:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, replace with `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, replace with `#A B#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n4.
