    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, applying the rules until no more rewrites are possible. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the Program**: Start with the given sequence of tokens.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Tokens**: Loop through the sequence and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n\n3. **Apply Rewrite Rules**: For each pair, apply the appropriate rewrite rule:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A` or `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, swap them to `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, swap them to `#A B#`.\n\n4. **Repeat Until Stable**: Continue applying the rules until no more changes occur in a full pass through the sequence.\n\n5. **Output the Final State**: Once the sequence is stable, output the final state in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Step back to check new neighbors\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Step back to check new neighbors\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # Swap them to #B A#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # Swap them to #A B#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['#A', 'B#', 'A#', 'A#', '#A', '#A', '#A', '#A', '#B', 'A#']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rewriting process and print the final state of the program in the required format."
