    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, applying the rules until no more rewrites are possible. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the Program**: Start with the given sequence of tokens.\n\n2. **Iterate and Apply Rules**: \n   - Traverse the list of tokens.\n   - Check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n   - Apply the appropriate rule based on the pair.\n   - If a rule is applied, modify the list accordingly and restart the process from the beginning.\n\n3. **Repeat Until Stable**: Continue the process until a full pass through the list results in no changes, indicating that no more rules can be applied.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Once the sequence is stable, output the final state of the program.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # A# #A becomes nothing\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Step back to recheck the previous pair\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # A# #B becomes #B A#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # B# #A becomes #A B#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # B# #B becomes nothing\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Step back to recheck the previous pair\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['A#', 'B#', 'B#', '#B', '#B', '#B', '#B', '#B', '#A', 'B#']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rewriting process and print the final state of the program in the required format."
