    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens to see if they match any of the rules. If they do, we'll apply the rule and modify the sequence accordingly. We'll continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Create a loop that will continue until no more changes can be made to the program.\n3. In each iteration, check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. If a pair matches one of the rules, apply the rule:\n   - Remove both tokens if they match the \"nothing\" rule.\n   - Swap the tokens if they match the swapping rule.\n5. If any changes are made, continue the loop; otherwise, exit the loop.\n6. Once the loop is complete, join the tokens back into a string and print the final state of the program.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(program):\n    tokens = program.split()\n    changed = True\n\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # A# #A becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # A# #B becomes #B A#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = tokens[i + 1], tokens[i]\n                i += 1\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # B# #A becomes #A B#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = tokens[i + 1], tokens[i]\n                i += 1\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # B# #B becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n    return ' '.join(tokens)\n\nprogram = \"#A A# A# #A A# A# B# B# #A #B\"\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after applying all possible rewriting rules.",
