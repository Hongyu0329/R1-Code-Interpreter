    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens, and apply the appropriate rewriting rule. We'll continue this process until no more rewrites can be applied.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Create a loop that will continue until no changes are made in a full pass through the list.\n3. In each pass, iterate through the list of tokens and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. Apply the rewriting rules:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A` or `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, swap them to `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, swap them to `#A B#`.\n5. If any changes are made, start a new pass through the list.\n6. Once no more changes can be made, output the final state of the program.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == \"A#\" and tokens[i + 1] == \"#A\":\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            # Move back one step to check the new pair at this position\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif tokens[i] == \"A#\" and tokens[i + 1] == \"#B\":\n            # Swap them to #B A#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = \"#B\", \"A#\"\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == \"B#\" and tokens[i + 1] == \"#A\":\n            # Swap them to #A B#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = \"#A\", \"B#\"\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == \"B#\" and tokens[i + 1] == \"#B\":\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            # Move back one step to check the new pair at this position\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = [\"#B\", \"A#\", \"B#\", \"#B\", \"B#\", \"#A\", \"A#\", \"B#\", \"A#\", \"A#\"]\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after all possible rewrites have been applied."
