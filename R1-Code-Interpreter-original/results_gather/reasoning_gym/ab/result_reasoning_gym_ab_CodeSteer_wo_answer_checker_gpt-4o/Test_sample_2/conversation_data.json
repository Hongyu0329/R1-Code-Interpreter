    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens and apply the rules until no more rewrites are possible. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Create a loop that will continue until no more changes can be made to the program.\n3. In each iteration, check each pair of neighboring tokens and apply the appropriate rewrite rule.\n4. If a rule is applied, update the program and mark that a change has been made.\n5. If no changes are made in an iteration, the program is in its final state.\n6. Convert the final list of tokens back to a string and print it in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(program):\n    tokens = program.split()\n    changed = True\n\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # A# #A becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # A# #B becomes #B A#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n                i += 1\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # B# #A becomes #A B#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n                i += 1\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # B# #B becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n    return ' '.join(tokens)\n\nprogram = \"#A A# B# A# #B #A A# #B #A #A\"\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after all possible rewrites have been applied."
