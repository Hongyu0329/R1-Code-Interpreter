    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens to see if they match any of the rules. If they do, we'll apply the rule and modify the sequence accordingly. We'll continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Set a flag to indicate whether any changes were made in the current iteration.\n3. Iterate through the list of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. If a pair matches one of the rules, apply the rule:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A` or `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, swap them to `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, swap them to `#A B#`.\n5. If any changes were made, repeat the process from step 2.\n6. Once no more changes can be made, output the final state of the program.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(program):\n    tokens = program.split()\n    changed = True\n\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # A# #A becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # A# #B becomes #B A#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n                i += 1\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                # B# #A becomes #A B#\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n                i += 1\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                # B# #B becomes nothing\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n    return ' '.join(tokens)\n\nprogram = \"B# #B #A A# A# A# A# #A #A A#\"\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after applying all possible rewriting rules."
