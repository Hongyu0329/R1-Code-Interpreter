    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens, and apply the appropriate rewriting rule. We'll continue this process until no more rewrites are possible.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Set a flag to track whether any rewrites occur in an iteration.\n3. Iterate over the list of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. Apply the rewriting rules:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A` or `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, replace it with `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, replace it with `#A B#`.\n5. If any rewrites occur, repeat the process. Otherwise, stop.\n6. Convert the final list of tokens back to a string and output it in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(program):\n    tokens = program.split()\n    changed = True\n\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n                changed = True\n                i += 1\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n                changed = True\n                i += 1\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n    return ' '.join(tokens)\n\nprogram = \"B# B# #A #B B# #A #B #B #A A#\"\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after all possible rewrites have been applied."
