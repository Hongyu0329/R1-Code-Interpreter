    "To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate through the sequence and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rewrite rules.\n3. Apply the appropriate rule to rewrite the pair of tokens.\n4. Continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n5. Output the final sequence of tokens.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # A# #A becomes nothing\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to check for new pairs\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # A# #B becomes #B A#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # B# #A becomes #A B#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # B# #B becomes nothing\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to check for new pairs\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['B#', '#B', 'A#', 'B#', 'A#', 'A#', '#A', 'B#', 'A#', 'B#']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the final state of the program and print it in the required format."
