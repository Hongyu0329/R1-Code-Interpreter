    "To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate over the sequence and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n3. Apply the appropriate rewrite rule to each pair:\n   - If the pair is `A# #A`, remove both tokens.\n   - If the pair is `A# #B`, swap them to `#B A#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #A`, swap them to `#A B#`.\n   - If the pair is `B# #B`, remove both tokens.\n4. Continue applying the rules until no more changes can be made to the sequence.\n5. Output the final state of the program in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Step back to check the new pair\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # Swap them to #B A#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # Swap them to #A B#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Step back to check the new pair\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['#B', 'B#', '#A', 'B#', 'A#', 'A#', '#A', '#B', 'B#', 'B#']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the final state of the program and print it in the required format.",
