    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens, and apply the appropriate rewriting rule. We'll continue this process until no more rewrites can be applied.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the program as a list of tokens.\n2. Set a flag to indicate whether any rewrite has occurred in the current pass.\n3. Iterate over the list of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. Apply the appropriate rewrite rule based on the pair of tokens.\n5. If a rewrite occurs, update the list of tokens and set the flag to indicate a change.\n6. Repeat the process until no more rewrites can be applied (i.e., the flag remains unchanged).\n7. Convert the final list of tokens back to a string and output the result in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    tokens = tokens.split()\n    changed = True\n\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n                i += 1\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n                tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n                i += 1\n            elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n            else:\n                i += 1\n\n    return ' '.join(tokens)\n\nprogram = \"A# #A A# #A B# B# #A A# #B #B\"\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after all possible rewrites have been applied."
