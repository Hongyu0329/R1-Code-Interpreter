    "To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate through the sequence and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rewrite rules.\n3. Apply the rewrite rule to the matching pair, modifying the sequence accordingly.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more rules can be applied (i.e., the sequence remains unchanged after a full pass).\n5. Output the final sequence of tokens in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    # Define the rewrite rules\n    rules = {\n        ('A#', '#A'): [],\n        ('A#', '#B'): ['#B', 'A#'],\n        ('B#', '#A'): ['#A', 'B#'],\n        ('B#', '#B'): []\n    }\n    \n    # Convert the input string to a list of tokens\n    tokens = tokens.split()\n    \n    # Flag to check if any rule was applied\n    changed = True\n    \n    # Keep applying rules until no changes occur\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            pair = (tokens[i], tokens[i + 1])\n            if pair in rules:\n                # Apply the rule\n                replacement = rules[pair]\n                tokens[i:i + 2] = replacement\n                changed = True\n                # Move to the next pair after the replacement\n                i += len(replacement) - 1\n            else:\n                i += 1\n    \n    # Join the tokens back into a string\n    final_state = ' '.join(tokens)\n    print(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = \"A# B# B# #A A# B# #A A# #A #B\"\ncompute_program(program)\n```\n\nThis code will output the final state of the program after all applicable rewrite rules have been applied."
