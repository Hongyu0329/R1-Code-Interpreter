    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the A::B program according to the given rules. We'll iterate through the sequence of tokens, checking each pair of neighboring tokens to see if they match any of the rules. If they do, we'll apply the rule and continue the process until no more rules can be applied.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate through the sequence, checking each pair of neighboring tokens.\n3. Apply the appropriate rule if a pair matches one of the given rules.\n4. If a rule is applied, update the sequence and start the iteration from the beginning.\n5. Continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n6. Output the final state of the program.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # A# #A becomes nothing\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to recheck\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # A# #B becomes #B A#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # B# #A becomes #A B#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # B# #B becomes nothing\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to recheck\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['A#', '#B', 'B#', 'B#', '#B', '#B', 'B#', 'B#', 'B#', '#B']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rewriting process and output the final state of the program in the required format."
