    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rewriting process of the given sequence of tokens according to the specified rules. We'll iterate through the sequence, checking each pair of neighboring tokens, and apply the appropriate rule if their '#' characters face each other. We'll continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize the sequence of tokens.\n2. Create a loop that will continue until no changes are made in a full pass through the sequence.\n3. In each pass, iterate through the sequence and check each pair of neighboring tokens.\n4. Apply the appropriate rule if the '#' characters of the pair face each other.\n5. If a rule is applied, modify the sequence accordingly and mark that a change has been made.\n6. If no changes are made in a pass, the sequence is in its final state.\n7. Output the final state of the sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        if tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # A# #A becomes nothing\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n        elif tokens[i] == 'A#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # A# #B becomes #B A#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#A':\n            # B# #A becomes #A B#\n            tokens[i], tokens[i + 1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif tokens[i] == 'B#' and tokens[i + 1] == '#B':\n            # B# #B becomes nothing\n            tokens.pop(i)\n            tokens.pop(i)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['B#', 'B#', 'B#', 'A#', 'B#', '#B', '#B', '#A', '#A', '#A']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state\nprint(f\"<<<{' '.join(final_state)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rewriting process and output the final state of the program in the required format."
