    "To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Iterate through the sequence and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the given rewrite rules.\n3. Apply the rule to rewrite the pair of tokens.\n4. Continue this process until no more rules can be applied (i.e., the sequence remains unchanged after a full pass).\n5. Output the final state of the program in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_program(tokens):\n    # Define the rewrite rules\n    rules = {\n        ('A#', '#A'): [],\n        ('A#', '#B'): ['#B', 'A#'],\n        ('B#', '#A'): ['#A', 'B#'],\n        ('B#', '#B'): []\n    }\n    \n    # Convert the input string to a list of tokens\n    tokens = tokens.split()\n    \n    # Flag to check if any rule was applied\n    changed = True\n    \n    # Keep applying rules until no changes occur\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            pair = (tokens[i], tokens[i+1])\n            if pair in rules:\n                # Apply the rule\n                new_tokens = rules[pair]\n                tokens = tokens[:i] + new_tokens + tokens[i+2:]\n                changed = True\n                # Move to the next pair after the current one\n                i += len(new_tokens) - 1\n            else:\n                i += 1\n    \n    # Join the tokens back into a string\n    final_state = ' '.join(tokens)\n    return final_state\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = \"#A #A B# B# B# A# #A #B B# B#\"\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = compute_program(program)\n\n# Output the final state in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{final_state}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the final state of the program by applying the rewrite rules iteratively until no more changes can be made, and then it will print the result in the required format."
