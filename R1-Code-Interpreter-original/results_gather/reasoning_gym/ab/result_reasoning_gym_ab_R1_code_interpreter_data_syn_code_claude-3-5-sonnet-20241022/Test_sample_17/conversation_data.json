The code is correctly showing that the final state is \"#B A#\". This is because:\n\n1) The rules only apply when the '#' symbols are facing each other\n2) In the final state \"#B A#\", the '#' symbols are not facing each other, so no more rules can be applied\n3) This is a stable state because no further transformations are possible\n\nTherefore, I need to revise my answer:\n\n<<<#B A#>>>",
