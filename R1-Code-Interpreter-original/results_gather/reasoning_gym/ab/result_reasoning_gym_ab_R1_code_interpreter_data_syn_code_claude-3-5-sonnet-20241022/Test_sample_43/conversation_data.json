    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to understand the rewriting rules:\n   - When A# and #A are adjacent, they both disappear\n   - When A# and #B are adjacent, they swap positions\n   - When B# and #A are adjacent, they swap positions\n   - When B# and #B are adjacent, they both disappear\n\n2) I need to write code that:\n   - Represents the tokens as a list\n   - Repeatedly applies the rules until no more changes can be made\n   - Handles the different rewriting cases\n   - Returns the final state\n\nHere's the code to simulate this:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rules(tokens):\n    # Convert string to list for easier manipulation\n    if isinstance(tokens, str):\n        tokens = tokens.split()\n    \n    changed = True\n    while changed:\n        changed = False\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n            # Get current pair of tokens\n            pair = tokens[i:i+2]\n            \n            # Rule 1: A# #A -> nothing\n            if pair == ['A#', '#A']:\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n                continue\n                \n            # Rule 2: A# #B -> #B A#\n            elif pair == ['A#', '#B']:\n                tokens[i], tokens[i+1] = tokens[i+1], tokens[i]\n                changed = True\n                \n            # Rule 3: B# #A -> #A B#\n            elif pair == ['B#', '#A']:\n                tokens[i], tokens[i+1] = tokens[i+1], tokens[i]\n                changed = True\n                \n            # Rule 4: B# #B -> nothing\n            elif pair == ['B#', '#B']:\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                tokens.pop(i)\n                changed = True\n                continue\n                \n            i += 1\n    \n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = \"#B #B #B A# #B #A A# #A A# #A\"\nresult = apply_rules(program)\nprint(' '.join(result))\n```\n\nLet's analyze what happens:\n1) The program starts with: #B #B #B A# #B #A A# #A A# #A\n2) The code will repeatedly apply the rules until no more changes can be made\n3) The rules will be applied to adjacent pairs of tokens\n4) The process continues until we reach a stable state\n\nAfter running the code, we can get the final state.\n\n<<<#B #B #B #B>>>\n\nThe answer makes sense because:\n1) The A# and #A pairs will annihilate each other\n2) The remaining tokens can't interact further according to the rules\n3) No more rules can be applied to the final state",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me explain why this is the final state:\n\nStarting with: #B #B #B A# #B #A A# #A A# #A\n\nLet's follow the sequence:\n1) First, looking at the rightmost tokens, A# #A will annihilate (Rule 1)\n   - Result: #B #B #B A# #B #A A# #A\n2) Again, rightmost A# #A will annihilate\n   - Result: #B #B #B A# #B #A\n3) The remaining A# #A will annihilate\n   - Result: #B #B #B #B\n\nAt this point:\n- We only have #B tokens\n- There are no more possible transformations because:\n  - There are no A# tokens left\n  - The tokens are all #B, and we don't have any B# tokens to make B# #B pairs\n  - #B tokens next to each other don't trigger any rules\n\nTherefore, #B #B #B #B is indeed the final state, and the code output confirms this.\n\n<<<#B #B #B #B>>>"
