    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: \n   ```\n   B# A# #B #A #A #B #A #A #B #A\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Start from the left and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rules.\n   - Apply the rule and rewrite the sequence.\n   - Repeat the process until no more rules can be applied.\n\nLet's apply the rules step by step:\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - `B# A#` does not match any rule.\n  - `A# #B` matches the rule `A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#`.\n  - Rewrite: `B# #B A# #A #A #B #A #A #B #A`\n\n- **Step 2**:\n  - `B# #B` matches the rule `B# #B ... becomes ... nothing`.\n  - Rewrite: `A# #A #A #B #A #A #B #A`\n\n- **Step 3**:\n  - `A# #A` matches the rule `A# #A ... becomes ... nothing`.\n  - Rewrite: `#A #B #A #A #B #A`\n\n- **Step 4**:\n  - `#A #B` does not match any rule.\n  - `#B #A` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`.\n  - Rewrite: `#A #A B# #A`\n\n- **Step 5**:\n  - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n  - `#A B#` does not match any rule.\n  - `B# #A` matches the rule `B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#`.\n  - Rewrite: `#A #A #A B#`\n\n- **Step 6**:\n  - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n  - `#A #A` does not match any rule.\n  - `#A B#` does not match any rule.\n\nNo more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#A #A #A B#\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>#A #A #A B#"
