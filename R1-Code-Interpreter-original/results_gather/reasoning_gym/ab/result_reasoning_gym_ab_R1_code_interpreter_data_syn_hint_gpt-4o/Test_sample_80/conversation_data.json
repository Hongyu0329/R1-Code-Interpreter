    "To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: `#B #A #B #B B# #A B# #B A# #B`\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - We will scan the sequence from left to right and apply the rules wherever applicable.\n   - We continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n\n3. **Rewriting Rules**:\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n\nLet's implement this process using Python code to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\ndef apply_rules(program):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(program) - 1:\n        if program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program = program[:i] + program[i+2:]\n        elif program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program = program[:i] + ['#B', 'A#'] + program[i+2:]\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program = program[:i] + ['#A', 'B#'] + program[i+2:]\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program = program[:i] + program[i+2:]\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return program\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['#B', '#A', '#B', '#B', 'B#', '#A', 'B#', '#B', 'A#', '#B']\n\n# Apply rules until no more changes\nprevious_program = None\nwhile program != previous_program:\n    previous_program = program\n    program = apply_rules(program)\n\n# Print the final state of the program\nprint(program)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the rewriting process and output the final state of the program. Let's see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the program has been reduced to `['#B', '#A', '#B', '#B', '#A', 'A#']`.
