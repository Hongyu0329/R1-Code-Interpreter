    "To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: \n   ```\n   B# A# #B A# B# #A A# A# #B #B\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Start from the left and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rules.\n   - Apply the rule and rewrite the sequence.\n   - Repeat the process until no more rules can be applied.\n\n3. **Rules**:\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n\nLet's apply these rules step by step:\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - `B# A#` (no rule applies)\n  - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n  - New sequence: `B# #B A# A# B# #A A# A# #B #B`\n\n- **Step 2**:\n  - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n  - New sequence: `A# A# B# #A A# A# #B #B`\n\n- **Step 3**:\n  - `A# A#` (no rule applies)\n  - `A# B#` (no rule applies)\n  - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n  - New sequence: `A# A# #A B# A# A# #B #B`\n\n- **Step 4**:\n  - `A# #A` becomes nothing\n  - New sequence: `A# B# A# A# #B #B`\n\n- **Step 5**:\n  - `A# B#` (no rule applies)\n  - `B# A#` (no rule applies)\n  - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n  - New sequence: `A# B# #B A# A# #B`\n\n- **Step 6**:\n  - `A# B#` (no rule applies)\n  - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n  - New sequence: `A# A# A# #B`\n\n- **Step 7**:\n  - `A# A#` (no rule applies)\n  - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n  - New sequence: `A# A# #B A#`\n\n- **Step 8**:\n  - `A# A#` (no rule applies)\n  - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n  - New sequence: `A# #B A# A#`\n\n- **Step 9**:\n  - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n  - New sequence: `#B A# A# A#`\n\n- **Step 10**:\n  - `A# A#` (no rule applies)\n  - `A# A#` (no rule applies)\n\nNo more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n\n```\n#B A# A# A#\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'#B A# A# A#'>>>"
