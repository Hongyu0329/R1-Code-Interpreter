    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: A# A# B# A# #A #A #B #B #B #B\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Start from the left and look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rules.\n   - Apply the rule and rewrite the sequence.\n\nLet's go through the sequence:\n\n- **Step 1**: A# A# B# A# #A #A #B #B #B #B\n  - A# A# -> No rule applies.\n  - A# B# -> No rule applies.\n  - B# A# -> Apply rule: B# A# becomes #A B#\n  - New sequence: A# A# #A B# #A #A #B #B #B #B\n\n- **Step 2**: A# A# #A B# #A #A #B #B #B #B\n  - A# A# -> No rule applies.\n  - A# #A -> Apply rule: A# #A becomes nothing\n  - New sequence: A# B# #A #A #B #B #B #B\n\n- **Step 3**: A# B# #A #A #B #B #B #B\n  - A# B# -> No rule applies.\n  - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#\n  - New sequence: A# #A B# #A #B #B #B #B\n\n- **Step 4**: A# #A B# #A #B #B #B #B\n  - A# #A -> Apply rule: A# #A becomes nothing\n  - New sequence: B# #A #B #B #B #B\n\n- **Step 5**: B# #A #B #B #B #B\n  - B# #A -> Apply rule: B# #A becomes #A B#\n  - New sequence: #A B# #B #B #B #B\n\n- **Step 6**: #A B# #B #B #B #B\n  - #A B# -> No rule applies.\n  - B# #B -> Apply rule: B# #B becomes nothing\n  - New sequence: #A #B #B #B\n\n- **Step 7**: #A #B #B #B\n  - #A #B -> No rule applies.\n  - #B #B -> Apply rule: #B #B becomes nothing\n  - New sequence: #A #B\n\n- **Step 8**: #A #B\n  - #A #B -> No rule applies.\n\nNo more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is:\n\n#A #B\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> #A #B <<<answer>>>"
