    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: \n   ```\n   B# #A #B A# B# B# #A #B B# #A\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rules and apply the transformation.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **B# #A** becomes **#A B#**:\n     ```\n     #A B# #B A# B# B# #A #B B# #A\n     ```\n   - **#B A#** becomes **A# #B**:\n     ```\n     #A B# A# #B B# B# #A #B B# #A\n     ```\n   - **A# #B** becomes **#B A#**:\n     ```\n     #A B# #B A# B# B# #A #B B# #A\n     ```\n   - **B# #A** becomes **#A B#**:\n     ```\n     #A #A B# B# B# #A #B B# #A\n     ```\n   - **A# #A** becomes **nothing**:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# B# #A #B B# #A\n     ```\n   - **B# #A** becomes **#A B#**:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #A B# #A\n     ```\n   - **B# #A** becomes **#A B#**:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A B# #A\n     ```\n   - **A# #A** becomes **nothing**:\n     ```\n     #A B# B# #A\n     ```\n   - **B# #A** becomes **#A B#**:\n     ```\n     #A B# #A\n     ```\n   - **A# #A** becomes **nothing**:\n     ```\n     #A B#\n     ```\n\n4. **Final State**:\n   - After applying all possible transformations, the final state of the program is:\n     ```\n     #A B#\n     ```\n\nNow, let's confirm this process using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef apply_rules(program):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(program) - 1:\n        if program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n        elif program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program[i], program[i+1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program[i], program[i+1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return program\n\nprogram = ['B#', '#A', '#B', 'A#', 'B#', 'B#', '#A', '#B', 'B#', '#A']\nfinal_state = apply_rules(program)\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final state of the program.",
