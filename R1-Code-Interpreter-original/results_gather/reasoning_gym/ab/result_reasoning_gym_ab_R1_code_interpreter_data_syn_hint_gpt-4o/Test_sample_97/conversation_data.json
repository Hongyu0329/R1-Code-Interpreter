  "question": "A::B is a system with 4 tokens: `A#`, `#A`, `B#` and `#B`.\n\nAn A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:\n\n    B# A# #B #A B#\n\nTo *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:\n\n    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing\n    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#\n    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#\n    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing\n\nIn other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,\nthey must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.\n\nNow, consider the following program:\n\n#A A# #B B# #A B# A# B# B# #A\n\nReturn the final state of the program.\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: `#A A# #B B# #A B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match the rules and apply the corresponding transformation.\n   - Continue this process until no more transformations can be applied.\n\nLet's apply the rules step by step:\n\n- **Step 1**: `#A A#` matches the rule `A# #A` which becomes nothing. So, remove `A# #A`.\n  - New sequence: `#B B# #A B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n- **Step 2**: `B# #A` matches the rule `B# #A` which becomes `#A B#`.\n  - New sequence: `#B #A B# B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n- **Step 3**: `#B B#` matches the rule `B# #B` which becomes nothing. So, remove `B# #B`.\n  - New sequence: `#A B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n- **Step 4**: `B# #A` matches the rule `B# #A` which becomes `#A B#`.\n  - New sequence: `#A #A B# B# A# B#`\n\n- **Step 5**: `#A A#` matches the rule `A# #A` which becomes nothing. So, remove `A# #A`.\n  - New sequence: `B# B# B#`\n\n- **Step 6**: `B# B#` matches the rule `B# #B` which becomes nothing. So, remove `B# #B`.\n  - New sequence: `B#`\n\nNow, no more rules can be applied. The final state of the program is `B#`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rules(program):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(program) - 1:\n        if program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program[i], program[i+1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program[i], program[i+1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return program\n\nprogram = ['#A', 'A#', '#B', 'B#', '#A', 'B#', 'A#', 'B#', 'B#', '#A']\nfinal_state = apply_rules(program)\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final state of the program.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rules were not applied correctly, as the output does not match the expected final state. Let's revisit the problem and ensure that the rules are applied correctly.\n\nThe rules for rewriting are:\n- `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n- `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n- `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n- `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n\nLet's manually apply these rules step by step to the initial sequence:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: `#A A# #B B# #A B# A# B# B# #A`\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing: `#A #B B# #A B# A# B# B# #A`\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`: `#A #B #A B# A# B# B# #A`\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing: `#A #B B# B# A# B#`\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing: `#A #B A# B#`\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`: `#A #B B# A#`\n\n3. **Final State**: `#A #B B# A#`\n\nLet's implement this logic in a Python script to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rules(program):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(program) - 1:\n        if program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        elif program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program[i], program[i+1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program[i], program[i+1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return program\n\nprogram = ['#A', 'A#', '#B', 'B#', '#A', 'B#', 'A#', 'B#', 'B#', '#A']\nfinal_state = apply_rules(program)\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the final state of the program.",
