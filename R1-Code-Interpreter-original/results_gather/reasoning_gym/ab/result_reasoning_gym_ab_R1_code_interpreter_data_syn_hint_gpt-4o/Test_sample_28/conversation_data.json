    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the given rewriting rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Program**: `#A #A B# #A B# #B #B #A A# A#`\n\n2. **Apply Rules**:\n   - Look for pairs of tokens that match any of the rules.\n   - Apply the rule to rewrite the pair.\n   - Continue this process until no more rules can be applied.\n\n3. **Rules**:\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing.\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`.\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`.\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing.\n\nLet's apply these rules step by step:\n\n- **Step 1**: `#A #A B# #A B# #B #B #A A# A#`\n  - No rules apply to `#A #A`.\n  - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`: `#A #A #A B# B# #B #B #A A# A#`\n\n- **Step 2**: `#A #A #A B# B# #B #B #A A# A#`\n  - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`: `#A #A #A #A B# #B #B #A A# A#`\n\n- **Step 3**: `#A #A #A #A B# #B #B #A A# A#`\n  - `B# #B` becomes nothing: `#A #A #A #A #B #A A# A#`\n\n- **Step 4**: `#A #A #A #A #B #A A# A#`\n  - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`: `#A #A #A #A #A B# A# A#`\n\n- **Step 5**: `#A #A #A #A #A B# A# A#`\n  - `A# #A` becomes nothing: `#A #A #A #A #A B# A#`\n\n- **Step 6**: `#A #A #A #A #A B# A#`\n  - `A# #A` becomes nothing: `#A #A #A #A #A B#`\n\n- **Step 7**: `#A #A #A #A #A B#`\n  - No more rules can be applied.\n\nThe final state of the program is `#A #A #A #A #A B#`.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef apply_rules(program):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(program) - 1:\n        if program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n        elif program[i] == 'A#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program[i], program[i+1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#A':\n            program[i], program[i+1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif program[i] == 'B#' and program[i+1] == '#B':\n            program.pop(i)\n            program.pop(i)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return program\n\nprogram = ['#A', '#A', 'B#', '#A', 'B#', '#B', '#B', '#A', 'A#', 'A#']\nfinal_state = apply_rules(program)\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the final state.",
