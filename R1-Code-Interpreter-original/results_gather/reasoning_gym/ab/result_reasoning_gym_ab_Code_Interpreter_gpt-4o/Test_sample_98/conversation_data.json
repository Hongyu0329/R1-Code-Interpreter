    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Scan the sequence from left to right, looking for pairs of neighboring tokens that match one of the rewrite rules.\n3. Apply the rewrite rule to the matching pair, modifying the sequence accordingly.\n4.
