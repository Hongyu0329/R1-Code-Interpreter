    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Scan the sequence from left to right, looking for pairs of neighboring tokens that match one of the rewrite rules.\n3. Apply the rule to rewrite the pair of tokens.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more rules can be applied.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given program:\n\nInitial program: `B# A# #B A# B# #A A# A# #B #B`\n\nWe'll implement this in code to find the final state of the program.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_rules(program):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(program) - 1:\n        pair = program[i:i+2]\n        if pair == ['A#', '#A']:\n            program = program[:i] + program[i+2:]\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to check for new pairs\n        elif pair == ['A#', '#B']:\n            program[i:i+2] = ['#B', 'A#']\n            i += 1\n        elif pair == ['B#', '#A']:\n            program[i:i+2] = ['#A', 'B#']\n            i += 1\n        elif pair == ['B#', '#B']:\n            program = program[:i] + program[i+2:]\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Move back one step to check for new pairs\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return program\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['B#', 'A#', '#B', 'A#', 'B#', '#A', 'A#', 'A#', '#B', '#B']\n\n# Apply the rules until no more changes can be made\nfinal_state = apply_rules(program)\nfinal_state\nassistant > The final state of the program after applying the rewrite rules is:\n\n`B# #B A# A# #A B# A# #B #B A#`\n\nTherefore, the output in the required format is:\n\n`<<<B# #B A# A# #A B# A# #B #B A#>>>`"
