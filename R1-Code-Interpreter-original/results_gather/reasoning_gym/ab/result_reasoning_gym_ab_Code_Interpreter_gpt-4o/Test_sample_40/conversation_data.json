    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Scan the sequence from left to right, looking for pairs of tokens that match any of the rewrite rules.\n3. Apply the rule to the first matching pair found, and rewrite the sequence accordingly.\n4.
