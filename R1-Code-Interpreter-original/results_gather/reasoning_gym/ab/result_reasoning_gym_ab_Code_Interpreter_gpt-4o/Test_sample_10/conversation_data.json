    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Scan the sequence from left to right, looking for pairs of neighboring tokens that match one of the rewrite rules.\n3. Apply the rule to the pair, modifying the sequence accordingly.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more rules can be applied.\n\nLet's implement this process in code to find the final state of the program.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_rules(tokens):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens) - 1:\n        pair = tokens[i:i+2]\n        if pair == ['A#', '#A']:\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens = tokens[:i] + tokens[i+2:]\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Step back to check for new pairs\n        elif pair == ['A#', '#B']:\n            # Swap the tokens\n            tokens[i], tokens[i+1] = '#B', 'A#'\n            i += 1\n        elif pair == ['B#', '#A']:\n            # Swap the tokens\n            tokens[i], tokens[i+1] = '#A', 'B#'\n            i += 1\n        elif pair == ['B#', '#B']:\n            # Remove both tokens\n            tokens = tokens[:i] + tokens[i+2:]\n            i = max(i - 1, 0)  # Step back to check for new pairs\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\n# Initial program\nprogram = ['A#', 'A#', '#A', 'B#', 'B#', 'B#', 'A#', 'A#', '#B', 'A#']\n\n# Compute the final state\nfinal_state = apply_rules(program)\nfinal_state\nassistant > The final state of the program after applying the rewrite rules is:\n\n`A# B# B# B# A# #B A# A#`\n\nThus, the output in the required format is:\n\n<<<A# B# B# B# A# #B A# A#>>>"
