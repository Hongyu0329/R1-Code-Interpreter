    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied.

Apply the rules to adjacent tokens:\n   - `A# #A` becomes nothing\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `B# #B` becomes nothing\n\nWe will continue applying these rules until no more changes can be made.
