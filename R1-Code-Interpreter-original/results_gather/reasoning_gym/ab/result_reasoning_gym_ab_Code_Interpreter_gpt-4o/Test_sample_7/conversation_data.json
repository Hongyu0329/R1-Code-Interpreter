    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence: `B# #A #B A# B# B# #B A# #A #A`\n2. Apply the rewrite rules to neighboring tokens:\n   - `B# #A` becomes `#A B#`\n   - `A# #A` and `B# #B` become nothing\n   - `A# #B` becomes `#B A#`\n\nWe will continue applying these rules until no more changes can be made.
