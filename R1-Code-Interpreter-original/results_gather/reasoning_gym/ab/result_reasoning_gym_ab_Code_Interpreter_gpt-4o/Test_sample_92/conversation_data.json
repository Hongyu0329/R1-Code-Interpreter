    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to iteratively apply the given rewrite rules to the sequence of tokens until no more rules can be applied. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial sequence of tokens.\n2. Scan the sequence from left to right, looking for pairs of neighboring tokens that match any of the rewrite rules.\n3.
