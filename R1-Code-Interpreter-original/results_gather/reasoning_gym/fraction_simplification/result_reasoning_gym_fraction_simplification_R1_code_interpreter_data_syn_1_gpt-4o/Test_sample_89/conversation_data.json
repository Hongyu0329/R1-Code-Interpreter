    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3375}{8400}\\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n### Steps to Simplify the Fraction:\n\n1. **Find the GCD of 3375 and 8400**: \n   - We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n   \n2. **Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD**:\n   - This will give us the fraction in its simplest form.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the GCD and simplify the fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given numbers\nnumerator = 3375\ndenominator = 8400\n\n# Calculate GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\n# Simplify the fraction\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\n# Output the simplified fraction\nprint(f\"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the simplified fraction.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Simplify the fraction $\\dfrac{3375}{8400}$ to its lowest terms.
