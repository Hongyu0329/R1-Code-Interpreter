    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{507}{9113} \\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. Once we have the GCD, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this number to get the fraction in its simplest form.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of 507 and 9113 using Python, and then simplify the fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nnumerator = 507\ndenominator = 9113\n\ngcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\nprint(f\"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the simplified fraction.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the simplified fraction. The greatest common divisor of 507 and 9113 is 13, and dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 13 gives us the fraction in its simplest form.\n\n<<<39/701>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Simplify the fraction $507/9113$ to its lowest terms.
