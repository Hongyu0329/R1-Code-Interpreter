    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{25872}{33544}\\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. Once we have the GCD, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this number to get the fraction in its simplest form.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of 25872 and 33544 using Python, and then simplify the fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nnumerator = 25872\ndenominator = 33544\n\ngcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\nprint(f\"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the simplified fraction.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the simplified fraction. Therefore, the fraction \\(\\frac{25872}{33544}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{462}{599}\\).\n\n<<<462/599>>>"
