    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{546}{25558} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. Once we have the GCD, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this value to get the simplified fraction.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of 546 and 25558 using Python, and then simplify the fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nnumerator = 546\ndenominator = 25558\n\ngcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\nprint(f\"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the simplified fraction.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the simplified fraction. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 546 and 25558 is 26. By dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 26, we obtain the simplified fraction.\n\n<<<21/983>>>"
