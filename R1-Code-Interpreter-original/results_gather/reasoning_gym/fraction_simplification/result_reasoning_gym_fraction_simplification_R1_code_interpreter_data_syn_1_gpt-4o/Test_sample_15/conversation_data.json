    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3640}{20216}\\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. Once we have the GCD, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this number to get the fraction in its simplest form.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of 3640 and 20216 using Python, and then simplify the fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numerator and denominator\nnumerator = 3640\ndenominator = 20216\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\n# Simplify the fraction\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\n# Print the simplified fraction\nprint(f\"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the simplified fraction.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3640 and 20216, and then used it to simplify the fraction. The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{65}{361}\\).\n\n<<<65/361>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Simplify the fraction $\\dfrac{3640}{20216}$ to its lowest terms.
