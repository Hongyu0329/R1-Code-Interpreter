    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{29414}{32417}\\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. Once we have the GCD, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this value to get the fraction in its simplest form.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of 29414 and 32417 using Python's built-in function from the `math` module.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nnumerator = 29414\ndenominator = 32417\n\ngcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\nprint(f\"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the GCD and then divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction. Let's execute this code to find the simplified fraction.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 29414 and 32417, and then used it to simplify the fraction. The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{382}{421}\\).\n\n<<<382/421>>>"
