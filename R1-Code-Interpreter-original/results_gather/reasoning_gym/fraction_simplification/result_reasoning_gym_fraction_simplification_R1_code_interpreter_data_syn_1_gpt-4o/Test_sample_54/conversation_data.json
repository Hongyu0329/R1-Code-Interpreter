    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3188}{3244}\\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. Once we have the GCD, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this number to get the fraction in its simplest form.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of 3188 and 3244 using Python, and then simplify the fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nnumerator = 3188\ndenominator = 3244\n\ngcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\nprint(f\"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the simplified fraction.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3188 and 3244, and used it to simplify the fraction. The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{797}{811}\\).\n\n<<<797/811>>>"
