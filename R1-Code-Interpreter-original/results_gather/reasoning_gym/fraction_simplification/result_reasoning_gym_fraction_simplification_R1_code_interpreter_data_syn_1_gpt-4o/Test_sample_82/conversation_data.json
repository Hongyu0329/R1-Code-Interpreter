    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3211}{7501}\\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. Once we have the GCD, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this value to simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of 3211 and 7501 using Python, and then simplify the fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numerator and denominator\nnumerator = 3211\ndenominator = 7501\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\n# Simplify the fraction\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // gcd\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // gcd\n\n# Print the simplified fraction\nprint(f\"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the simplified fraction.",
    "The code execution has provided the simplified fraction as \\(\\frac{247}{577}\\). This means that the greatest common divisor of 3211 and 7501 is 13, and dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 13 gives us the fraction in its lowest terms.\n\n<<<247/577>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Simplify the fraction $\\frac{3211}{7501}$ to its lowest terms.
