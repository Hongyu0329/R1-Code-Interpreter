    "To simplify the fraction 10750/13300 to its lowest terms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** \n   - The first step in simplifying a fraction is to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Perform prime factorization of both the numerator (10750) and the denominator (13300) to help find the GCD.\n   - 10750: \n     - Divide by 2: 10750 ÷ 2 = 5375\n     - 5375 is odd, divide by 5: 5375 ÷ 5 = 1075\n     - 1075 is odd, divide by 5: 1075 ÷ 5 = 215\n     - 215 is odd, divide by 5: 215 ÷ 5 = 43\n     - 43 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 10750: 2 × 5^3 × 43\n\n   - 13300:\n     - Divide by 2: 13300 ÷ 2 = 6650\n     - Divide by 2 again: 6650 ÷ 2 = 3325\n     - 3325 is odd, divide by 5: 3325 ÷ 5 = 665\n     - 665 is odd, divide by 5: 665 ÷ 5 = 133\n     - 133 is not divisible by 5, divide by 7: 133 ÷ 7 = 19\n     - 19 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 13300: 2^2 × 5^2 × 7 × 19\n\n3. **Find the GCD:**\n   - Compare the prime factors of both numbers and take the lowest power of all common prime factors.\n   - Common prime factors: 2 and 5\n   - GCD = 2^1 × 5^2 = 2 × 25 = 50\n\n4. **Divide Both Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - Divide the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction.\n   - Simplified numerator: 10750 ÷ 50 = 215\n   - Simplified denominator: 13300 ÷ 50 = 266\n\n5. **Verify the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - Check if 215 and 266 have any common factors other than 1. Since they do not, the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nThe simplified fraction is 215/266.\n\n<<<215/266>>>"
