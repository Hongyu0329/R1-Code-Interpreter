    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{682}{902} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 682 and 902.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start by finding the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 682:\n     - 682 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 682 \\div 2 = 341 \\).\n     - 341 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 7: \\( 341 \\div 7 \\approx 48.71 \\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 11: \\( 341 \\div 11 \\approx 31 \\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 13: \\( 341 \\div 13 = 26.23 \\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 17: \\( 341 \\div 17 = 20.06 \\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 19: \\( 341 \\div 19 = 17.947 \\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 23: \\( 341 \\div 23 = 14.826 \\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 29: \\( 341 \\div 29 = 11.758 \\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 31: \\( 341 \\div 31 = 11 \\) (divisible).\n     - So, \\( 341 = 31 \\times 11 \\).\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 682 is \\( 2 \\times 31 \\times 11 \\).\n\n   - For 902:\n     - 902 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 902 \\div 2 = 451 \\).\n     - 451 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 7: \\( 451 \\div 7 \\approx 64.428 \\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 11: \\( 451 \\div 11 = 41 \\) (divisible).\n     - So, \\( 451 = 41 \\times 11 \\).\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 902 is \\( 2 \\times 41 \\times 11 \\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - The common factors of 682 and 902 are 2 and 11.\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors.\n   - GCD = \\( 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - Simplified numerator: \\( 682 \\div 22 = 31 \\).\n   - Simplified denominator: \\( 902 \\div 22 = 41 \\).\n\n2. **Write the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{31}{41} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe fraction \\( \\frac{682}{902} \\) simplified to its lowest terms is:\n\n<<<31/41>>>"
