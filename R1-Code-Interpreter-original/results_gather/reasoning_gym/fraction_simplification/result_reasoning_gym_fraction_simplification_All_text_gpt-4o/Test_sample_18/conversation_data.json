    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{17850}{30695}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 17850:**\n   - 17850 is even, so divide by 2: \\(17850 \\div 2 = 8925\\).\n   - 8925 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(8925 \\div 5 = 1785\\).\n   - 1785 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(1785 \\div 5 = 357\\).\n   - 357 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 15): \\(357 \\div 3 = 119\\).\n   - 119 is divisible by 7 (119 = 7 Ã— 17): \\(119 \\div 7 = 17\\).\n   - 17 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 17850 is \\(2 \\times 5^2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 17\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 30695:**\n   - 30695 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(30695 \\div 5 = 6139\\).\n   - 6139 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7: \\(6139 \\div 7 = 877\\).\n   - 877 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n   - Check divisibility by 11: \\(877 \\div 11 = 79.727\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 13: \\(877 \\div 13 = 67.461\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 17: \\(877 \\div 17 = 51.588\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 19: \\(877 \\div 19 = 46.158\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 23: \\(877 \\div 23 = 38.130\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 29: \\(877 \\div 29 = 30.241\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 31: \\(877 \\div 31 = 28.290\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 37: \\(877 \\div 37 = 23.703\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 41: \\(877 \\div 41 = 21.390\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 43: \\(877 \\div 43 = 20.395\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 47: \\(877 \\div 47 = 18.660\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 53: \\(877 \\div 53 = 16.547\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 59: \\(877 \\div 59 = 14.864\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 61: \\(877 \\div 61 = 14.377\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 67: \\(877 \\div 67 = 13.090\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 71: \\(877 \\div 71 = 12.352\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 73: \\(877 \\div 73 = 12.014\\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 79: \\(877 \\div 79 = 11.108\\) (not divisible).\n   - 877 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 30695 is \\(5 \\times 7 \\times 877\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors are 5 and 7.\n- The GCD is \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (35):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{17850 \\div 35}{30695 \\div 35} = \\frac{510}{877}\n  \\]\n\n- Check if 510 and 877 have any common factors:\n  - 510: \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 17\\)\n  - 877 is a prime number.\n\nSince 510 and 877 have no common factors other than 1, \\(\\frac{510}{877}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{510}{877}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{510}{877}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{510}{877}>>>"
