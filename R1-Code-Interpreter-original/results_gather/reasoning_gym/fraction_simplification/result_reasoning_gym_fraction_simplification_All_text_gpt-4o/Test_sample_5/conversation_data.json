    "To simplify the fraction 7476/8388 to its lowest terms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** \n   - The first step in simplifying a fraction is to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Perform prime factorization of both the numerator (7476) and the denominator (8388) to find their common factors.\n   - 7476: \n     - Divide by 2: 7476 ÷ 2 = 3738\n     - Divide by 2: 3738 ÷ 2 = 1869\n     - Divide by 3: 1869 ÷ 3 = 623\n     - 623 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 7476 are 2² × 3 × 623.\n   - 8388:\n     - Divide by 2: 8388 ÷ 2 = 4194\n     - Divide by 2: 4194 ÷ 2 = 2097\n     - Divide by 3: 2097 ÷ 3 = 699\n     - Divide by 3: 699 ÷ 3 = 233\n     - 233 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 8388 are 2² × 3² × 233.\n\n3. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - From the prime factorizations, identify the common factors.\n   - Common factors are 2² and 3.\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - Multiply the common factors to find the GCD.\n   - GCD = 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12.\n\n5. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction.\n   - Simplified numerator: 7476 ÷ 12 = 623\n   - Simplified denominator: 8388 ÷ 12 = 699\n\n6. **Verify the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - Check if 623 and 699 have any common factors other than 1.\n   - Since 623 is a prime number and does not divide 699, the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nThe simplified fraction is 623/699.\n\nFinal answer: <<<623/699>>>"
