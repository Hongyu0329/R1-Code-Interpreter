    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{21534}{23384} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 21534 and 23384.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - Factorize both numbers into their prime factors.\n   - However, this can be cumbersome for large numbers, so we often use the Euclidean algorithm instead.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm.\n   - Start with the two numbers: 23384 and 21534.\n   - Divide 23384 by 21534 and find the remainder.\n   - Replace 23384 with 21534 and 21534 with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n   Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n   - \\( 23384 \\div 21534 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 1850 \\)\n   - \\( 21534 \\div 1850 = 11 \\) remainder \\( 1284 \\)\n   - \\( 1850 \\div 1284 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 566 \\)\n   - \\( 1284 \\div 566 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 152 \\)\n   - \\( 566 \\div 152 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 110 \\)\n   - \\( 152 \\div 110 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 42 \\)\n   - \\( 110 \\div 42 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 26 \\)\n   - \\( 42 \\div 26 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 16 \\)\n   - \\( 26 \\div 16 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 10 \\)\n   - \\( 16 \\div 10 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 6 \\)\n   - \\( 10 \\div 6 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 4 \\)\n   - \\( 6 \\div 4 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 2 \\)\n   - \\( 4 \\div 2 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 2, so the GCD of 21534 and 23384 is 2.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (2):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{21534}{23384} = \\frac{21534 \\div 2}{23384 \\div 2} = \\frac{10767}{11692}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{10767}{11692}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{10767}{11692}\\)>>>"
