    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{6705}{20205} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 6705 and 20205.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the numerator, 6705:\n     - 6705 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n     - Sum of digits of 6705 is \\(6 + 7 + 0 + 5 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:\n       \\[\n       6705 \\div 3 = 2235\n       \\]\n     - Sum of digits of 2235 is \\(2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12\\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:\n       \\[\n       2235 \\div 3 = 745\n       \\]\n     - Sum of digits of 745 is \\(7 + 4 + 5 = 16\\), not divisible by 3.\n     - 745 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5:\n       \\[\n       745 \\div 5 = 149\n       \\]\n     - 149 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6705 is \\(3^2 \\times 5 \\times 149\\).\n\n   - Now, for the denominator, 20205:\n     - 20205 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n     - Sum of digits of 20205 is \\(2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 5 = 9\\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:\n       \\[\n       20205 \\div 3 = 6735\n       \\]\n     - Sum of digits of 6735 is \\(6 + 7 + 3 + 5 = 21\\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:\n       \\[\n       6735 \\div 3 = 2245\n       \\]\n     - Sum of digits of 2245 is \\(2 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 13\\), not divisible by 3.\n     - 2245 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5:\n       \\[\n       2245 \\div 5 = 449\n       \\]\n     - 449 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 20205 is \\(3^2 \\times 5 \\times 449\\).\n\n2. **Identify the GCD:**\n   - The common prime factors are \\(3^2\\) and \\(5\\).\n   - Therefore, the GCD is \\(3^2 \\times 5 = 45\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.**\n\n- Divide the numerator by the GCD:\n  \\[\n  6705 \\div 45 = 149\n  \\]\n\n- Divide the denominator by the GCD:\n  \\[\n  20205 \\div 45 = 449\n  \\]\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{149}{449}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<149/449>>>"
