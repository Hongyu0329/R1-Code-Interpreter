    "To simplify the fraction 2522/7956 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\nStep 1: Identify the numerator and the denominator.\n- Numerator: 2522\n- Denominator: 7956\n\nStep 2: Find the GCD of 2522 and 7956.\n- Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n- Divide 7956 by 2522 and find the remainder.\n  - 7956 ÷ 2522 = 3 remainder 390\n- Divide 2522 by 390 and find the remainder.\n  - 2522 ÷ 390 = 6 remainder 182\n- Divide 390 by 182 and find the remainder.\n  - 390 ÷ 182 = 2 remainder 26\n- Divide 182 by 26 and find the remainder.\n  - 182 ÷ 26 = 7 remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. Therefore, the GCD of 2522 and 7956 is 26.\n\nStep 4: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n- Simplified numerator: 2522 ÷ 26 = 97\n- Simplified denominator: 7956 ÷ 26 = 306\n\nStep 5: Write the simplified fraction.\n- The fraction 2522/7956 simplifies to 97/306.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<97/306>>>"
