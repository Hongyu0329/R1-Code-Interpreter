    "To simplify the fraction 5688/6480 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Find the GCD of 5688 and 6480:**\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeated division and taking remainders.\n   - Start with the larger number, 6480, and divide it by the smaller number, 5688.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean algorithm:**\n   - 6480 ÷ 5688 = 1 remainder 792\n   - 5688 ÷ 792 = 7 remainder 120\n   - 792 ÷ 120 = 6 remainder 72\n   - 120 ÷ 72 = 1 remainder 48\n   - 72 ÷ 48 = 1 remainder 24\n   - 48 ÷ 24 = 2 remainder 0\n\n   When the remainder reaches 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. Here, the GCD is 24.\n\n3. **Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:**\n   - 5688 ÷ 24 = 237\n   - 6480 ÷ 24 = 270\n\n4. **Write the simplified fraction:**\n   - The fraction 5688/6480 simplifies to 237/270.\n\n5. **Check if the fraction can be simplified further:**\n   - Find the GCD of 237 and 270 using the Euclidean algorithm again.\n   - 270 ÷ 237 = 1 remainder 33\n   - 237 ÷ 33 = 7 remainder 6\n   - 33 ÷ 6 = 5 remainder 3\n   - 6 ÷ 3 = 2 remainder 0\n\n   The GCD is 3.\n\n6. **Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the new GCD:**\n   - 237 ÷ 3 = 79\n   - 270 ÷ 3 = 90\n\n7. **Write the final simplified fraction:**\n   - The fraction 237/270 simplifies to 79/90.\n\nTherefore, the fraction 5688/6480 simplified to its lowest terms is:\n\n<<<79/90>>>"
