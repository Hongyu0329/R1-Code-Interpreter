    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3188}{3244}\\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 3188 and 3244.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with 3188:\n     - 3188 is even, so divide by 2: \\(3188 \\div 2 = 1594\\).\n     - 1594 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1594 \\div 2 = 797\\).\n     - 797 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, etc.\n     - 797 is divisible by 13: \\(797 \\div 13 = 61\\).\n     - 61 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 3188: \\(2^2 \\times 13 \\times 61\\).\n\n   - Now for 3244:\n     - 3244 is even, so divide by 2: \\(3244 \\div 2 = 1622\\).\n     - 1622 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1622 \\div 2 = 811\\).\n     - 811 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, or 61.\n     - 811 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 3244: \\(2^2 \\times 811\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - The common factor between 3188 and 3244 is \\(2^2\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 3188 and 3244 is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide Both Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - \\(\\frac{3188}{4} = 797\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{3244}{4} = 811\\).\n\n2. **Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{3188}{3244}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{797}{811}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{797}{811}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{797}{811}>>>"
