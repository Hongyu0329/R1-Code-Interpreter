    "To simplify the fraction 3344/28652 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\nStep 1: Identify the numerator and the denominator.\n- Numerator: 3344\n- Denominator: 28652\n\nStep 2: Find the GCD of 3344 and 28652.\n- Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n- Divide 28652 by 3344 and find the remainder.\n  - 28652 ÷ 3344 = 8 remainder 280\n- Divide 3344 by 280 and find the remainder.\n  - 3344 ÷ 280 = 11 remainder 264\n- Divide 280 by 264 and find the remainder.\n  - 280 ÷ 264 = 1 remainder 16\n- Divide 264 by 16 and find the remainder.\n  - 264 ÷ 16 = 16 remainder 8\n- Divide 16 by 8 and find the remainder.\n  - 16 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 0\n\nWhen the remainder is 0, the divisor at this step is the GCD. Therefore, the GCD of 3344 and 28652 is 8.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n- Simplified numerator: 3344 ÷ 8 = 418\n- Simplified denominator: 28652 ÷ 8 = 3581\n\nStep 5: Write the simplified fraction.\n- The simplified fraction is 418/3581.\n\nTherefore, the fraction 3344/28652 simplified to its lowest terms is:\n\n<<<418/3581>>>"
