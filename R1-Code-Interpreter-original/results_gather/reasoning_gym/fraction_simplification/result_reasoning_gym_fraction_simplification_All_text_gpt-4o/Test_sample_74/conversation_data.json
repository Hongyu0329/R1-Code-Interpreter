    "To simplify the fraction 3472/4402 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Numerator and Denominator:**\n   - Numerator: 3472\n   - Denominator: 4402\n\n2. **Find the GCD of 3472 and 4402:**\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n   - Start by dividing the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder until the remainder is 0.\n   - The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - Divide 4402 by 3472:\n     - 4402 ÷ 3472 = 1 remainder 930\n   - Divide 3472 by 930:\n     - 3472 ÷ 930 = 3 remainder 682\n   - Divide 930 by 682:\n     - 930 ÷ 682 = 1 remainder 248\n   - Divide 682 by 248:\n     - 682 ÷ 248 = 2 remainder 186\n   - Divide 248 by 186:\n     - 248 ÷ 186 = 1 remainder 62\n   - Divide 186 by 62:\n     - 186 ÷ 62 = 3 remainder 0\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 62, so the GCD of 3472 and 4402 is 62.\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (62):\n     - Simplified Numerator: 3472 ÷ 62 = 56\n     - Simplified Denominator: 4402 ÷ 62 = 71\n\n5. **Write the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The fraction 3472/4402 simplifies to 56/71.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<56/71>>>"
