    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{11136}{11968}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 11136 and 11968.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 11136:\n     - 11136 is even, divide by 2: \\(11136 \\div 2 = 5568\\)\n     - 5568 is even, divide by 2: \\(5568 \\div 2 = 2784\\)\n     - 2784 is even, divide by 2: \\(2784 \\div 2 = 1392\\)\n     - 1392 is even, divide by 2: \\(1392 \\div 2 = 696\\)\n     - 696 is even, divide by 2: \\(696 \\div 2 = 348\\)\n     - 348 is even, divide by 2: \\(348 \\div 2 = 174\\)\n     - 174 is even, divide by 2: \\(174 \\div 2 = 87\\)\n     - 87 is divisible by 3: \\(87 \\div 3 = 29\\)\n     - 29 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 11136 is \\(2^7 \\times 3 \\times 29\\).\n\n   - For 11968:\n     - 11968 is even, divide by 2: \\(11968 \\div 2 = 5984\\)\n     - 5984 is even, divide by 2: \\(5984 \\div 2 = 2992\\)\n     - 2992 is even, divide by 2: \\(2992 \\div 2 = 1496\\)\n     - 1496 is even, divide by 2: \\(1496 \\div 2 = 748\\)\n     - 748 is even, divide by 2: \\(748 \\div 2 = 374\\)\n     - 374 is even, divide by 2: \\(374 \\div 2 = 187\\)\n     - 187 is divisible by 11: \\(187 \\div 11 = 17\\)\n     - 17 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 11968 is \\(2^6 \\times 11 \\times 17\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factor is 2.\n   - The lowest power of 2 common to both factorizations is \\(2^6\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide Both Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - \\(\\frac{11136}{64} = 174\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{11968}{64} = 187\\)\n\n2. **Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{174}{187}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{11136}{11968}\\) simplified to its lowest terms is \\(\\frac{174}{187}\\).\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{174}{187}\\)>>>"
