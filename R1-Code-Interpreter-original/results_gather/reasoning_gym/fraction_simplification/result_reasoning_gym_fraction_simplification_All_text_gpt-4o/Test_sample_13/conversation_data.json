    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{17577}{26964}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 17577:**\n   - Check divisibility by 2: 17577 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n   - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \\(1 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 27\\), which is divisible by 3. So, 17577 is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 17577 by 3: \\(17577 \\div 3 = 5859\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 5859 by 3: Sum of digits \\(5 + 8 + 5 + 9 = 27\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 5859 by 3: \\(5859 \\div 3 = 1953\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 1953 by 3: Sum of digits \\(1 + 9 + 5 + 3 = 18\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 1953 by 3: \\(1953 \\div 3 = 651\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 651 by 3: Sum of digits \\(6 + 5 + 1 = 12\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 651 by 3: \\(651 \\div 3 = 217\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 217 by 3: Sum of digits \\(2 + 1 + 7 = 10\\), not divisible by 3.\n   - Check divisibility by 5: 217 does not end in 0 or 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7: \\(217 \\div 7 = 31\\), which is an integer.\n   - 31 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 17577 is \\(3^4 \\times 7 \\times 31\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 26964:**\n   - Check divisibility by 2: 26964 is even, divisible by 2.\n   - Divide 26964 by 2: \\(26964 \\div 2 = 13482\\).\n   - 13482 is even, divisible by 2.\n   - Divide 13482 by 2: \\(13482 \\div 2 = 6741\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 6741 by 3: Sum of digits \\(6 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 18\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 6741 by 3: \\(6741 \\div 3 = 2247\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 2247 by 3: Sum of digits \\(2 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 15\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 2247 by 3: \\(2247 \\div 3 = 749\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 749 by 3: Sum of digits \\(7 + 4 + 9 = 20\\), not divisible by 3.\n   - Check divisibility by 5: 749 does not end in 0 or 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7: \\(749 \\div 7 = 107\\), which is an integer.\n   - 107 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 26964 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 107\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors are \\(3^2\\) and \\(7\\).\n- GCD is \\(3^2 \\times 7 = 63\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (63):\n  - Numerator: \\(17577 \\div 63 = 279\\).\n  - Denominator: \\(26964 \\div 63 = 428\\).\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{279}{428}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{279}{428}\\)>>>"
