    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{10230}{11730} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 10230 and 11730.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - **10230:**\n     - 10230 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 10230 \\div 2 = 5115 \\).\n     - 5115 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 5115 \\div 5 = 1023 \\).\n     - 1023 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 6): \\( 1023 \\div 3 = 341 \\).\n     - 341 is divisible by 11 (alternating sum of digits is 0): \\( 341 \\div 11 = 31 \\).\n     - 31 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 10230: \\( 2 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 11 \\times 31 \\).\n\n   - **11730:**\n     - 11730 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 11730 \\div 2 = 5865 \\).\n     - 5865 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 5865 \\div 5 = 1173 \\).\n     - 1173 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 12): \\( 1173 \\div 3 = 391 \\).\n     - 391 is divisible by 17 (391 divided by 17 is 23): \\( 391 \\div 17 = 23 \\).\n     - 23 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 11730: \\( 2 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 17 \\times 23 \\).\n\n2. **Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors are \\( 2 \\times 5 \\times 3 = 30 \\).\n\n3. **GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 10230 and 11730 is 30.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (30):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{10230}{11730} = \\frac{10230 \\div 30}{11730 \\div 30} = \\frac{341}{391}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Simplified Fraction.**\n\n- Check if 341 and 391 have any common factors:\n  - 341 is \\( 11 \\times 31 \\).\n  - 391 is \\( 17 \\times 23 \\).\n  - There are no common factors between 341 and 391.\n\nThus, the fraction \\( \\frac{341}{391} \\) is in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<341/391>>>"
