    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{2992}{8960}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have the fraction \\(\\frac{2992}{8960}\\).\n\n2. **Find the GCD of 2992 and 8960**:\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n   - Start with the larger number, 8960, and divide it by the smaller number, 2992.\n   - Calculate \\(8960 \\div 2992\\) which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 2976.\n   - Now, apply the Euclidean algorithm: find the GCD of 2992 and 2976.\n   - Calculate \\(2992 \\div 2976\\) which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 16.\n   - Next, find the GCD of 2976 and 16.\n   - Calculate \\(2976 \\div 16\\) which gives a quotient of 186 and a remainder of 0.\n   - Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 16.\n\n3. **Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD**:\n   - Divide 2992 by 16: \\(2992 \\div 16 = 187\\).\n   - Divide 8960 by 16: \\(8960 \\div 16 = 560\\).\n\n4. **Write the simplified fraction**:\n   - The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{187}{560}\\).\n\nTherefore, the fraction \\(\\frac{2992}{8960}\\) simplified to its lowest terms is \\(\\frac{187}{560}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{187}{560}>>>"
