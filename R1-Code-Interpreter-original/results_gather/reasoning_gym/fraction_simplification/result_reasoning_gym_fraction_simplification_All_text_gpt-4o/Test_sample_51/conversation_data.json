    "To simplify the fraction 30031/51035 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator (30031) and the denominator (51035) and then divide both by this GCD.\n\nStep 1: Identify the GCD of 30031 and 51035.\n- Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n- Start by dividing the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n- Repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder until the remainder is 0.\n- The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nStep 2: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n- Divide 51035 by 30031, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 21004.\n- Divide 30031 by 21004, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 9027.\n- Divide 21004 by 9027, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 2950.\n- Divide 9027 by 2950, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 177.\n- Divide 2950 by 177, which gives a quotient of 16 and a remainder of 118.\n- Divide 177 by 118, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 59.\n- Divide 118 by 59, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is 59, so the GCD of 30031 and 51035 is 59.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n- Divide 30031 by 59, which equals 509.\n- Divide 51035 by 59, which equals 865.\n\nTherefore, the fraction 30031/51035 simplifies to 509/865.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<509/865>>>"
