    "To simplify the fraction 9700/25000 to its lowest terms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** \n   - The first step in simplifying a fraction is to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Perform prime factorization of both the numerator (9700) and the denominator (25000) to help find the GCD.\n   - 9700: \n     - 9700 is even, so divide by 2: 9700 ÷ 2 = 4850\n     - 4850 is even, so divide by 2: 4850 ÷ 2 = 2425\n     - 2425 ends in 5, so divide by 5: 2425 ÷ 5 = 485\n     - 485 ends in 5, so divide by 5: 485 ÷ 5 = 97\n     - 97 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 9700: 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 97\n\n   - 25000:\n     - 25000 is even, so divide by 2: 25000 ÷ 2 = 12500\n     - 12500 is even, so divide by 2: 12500 ÷ 2 = 6250\n     - 6250 is even, so divide by 2: 6250 ÷ 2 = 3125\n     - 3125 ends in 5, so divide by 5: 3125 ÷ 5 = 625\n     - 625 ends in 5, so divide by 5: 625 ÷ 5 = 125\n     - 125 ends in 5, so divide by 5: 125 ÷ 5 = 25\n     - 25 ends in 5, so divide by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 25000: 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5\n\n3. **Find the GCD:**\n   - Compare the prime factors of both numbers and identify the common factors.\n   - Common prime factors: 2 × 2 × 5 × 5\n   - GCD = 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 = 100\n\n4. **Divide Both the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - Divide the numerator (9700) by the GCD (100): 9700 ÷ 100 = 97\n   - Divide the denominator (25000) by the GCD (100): 25000 ÷ 100 = 250\n\n5. **Write the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The simplified fraction is 97/250.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction of 9700/25000 is:\n\n<<<97/250>>>"
