    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{2754}{4777}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 2754 and 4777.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - First, we attempt to factorize both numbers to find common factors.\n   - For 2754:\n     - 2754 is even, so divide by 2: \\(2754 \\div 2 = 1377\\).\n     - 1377 is not divisible by 2. Check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits is 18, which is divisible by 3): \\(1377 \\div 3 = 459\\).\n     - 459 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18): \\(459 \\div 3 = 153\\).\n     - 153 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 9): \\(153 \\div 3 = 51\\).\n     - 51 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 6): \\(51 \\div 3 = 17\\).\n     - 17 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 2754: \\(2 \\times 3^4 \\times 17\\).\n\n   - For 4777:\n     - 4777 is not even, not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 25), not divisible by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5).\n     - Check divisibility by 7: \\(4777 \\div 7 \\approx 682.428\\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 11: \\(4777 \\div 11 \\approx 434.272\\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 13: \\(4777 \\div 13 = 367\\).\n     - 367 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 4777: \\(13 \\times 367\\).\n\n2. **Common Factors:**\n   - From the prime factorizations, the only common factor is 1 (since 13 and 17 are distinct primes).\n\n3. **GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 2754 and 4777 is 1.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{2754}{4777}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{2754}{4777}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{2754}{4777}>>>"
