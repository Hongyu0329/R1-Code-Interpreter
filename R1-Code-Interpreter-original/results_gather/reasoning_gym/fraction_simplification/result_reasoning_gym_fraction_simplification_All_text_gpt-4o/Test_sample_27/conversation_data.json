    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{7308}{19320}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 7308:**\n   - Check divisibility by 2: 7308 is even, so divide by 2.\n     \\[\n     7308 \\div 2 = 3654\n     \\]\n   - 3654 is even, divide by 2 again.\n     \\[\n     3654 \\div 2 = 1827\n     \\]\n   - 1827 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits is 18, divisible by 3).\n     \\[\n     1827 \\div 3 = 609\n     \\]\n   - 609 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 15).\n     \\[\n     609 \\div 3 = 203\n     \\]\n   - 203 is not divisible by 3, check divisibility by 7 (203 divided by 7 is 29).\n     \\[\n     203 \\div 7 = 29\n     \\]\n   - 29 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 7308 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 29\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 19320:**\n   - Check divisibility by 2: 19320 is even, so divide by 2.\n     \\[\n     19320 \\div 2 = 9660\n     \\]\n   - 9660 is even, divide by 2 again.\n     \\[\n     9660 \\div 2 = 4830\n     \\]\n   - 4830 is even, divide by 2 again.\n     \\[\n     4830 \\div 2 = 2415\n     \\]\n   - 2415 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits is 12).\n     \\[\n     2415 \\div 3 = 805\n     \\]\n   - 805 is not divisible by 3, check divisibility by 5 (last digit is 5).\n     \\[\n     805 \\div 5 = 161\n     \\]\n   - 161 is not divisible by 5, check divisibility by 7 (161 divided by 7 is 23).\n     \\[\n     161 \\div 7 = 23\n     \\]\n   - 23 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 19320 is \\(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 23\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors are \\(2^2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(7\\).\n- The GCD is \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (84):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{7308}{84} = 87\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{19320}{84} = 230\n  \\]\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{87}{230}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{87}{230}\\)>>>"
