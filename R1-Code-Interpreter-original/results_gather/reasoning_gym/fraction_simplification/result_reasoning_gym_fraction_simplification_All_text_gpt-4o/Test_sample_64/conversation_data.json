    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{1479}{1740}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 1479 and 1740.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - **1479:**\n     - Check divisibility by 2: 1479 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n     - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \\(1 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 21\\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:\n       \\[\n       1479 \\div 3 = 493\n       \\]\n     - Check divisibility of 493 by 3: Sum of digits \\(4 + 9 + 3 = 16\\), not divisible by 3.\n     - Check divisibility by 5: 493 does not end in 0 or 5, not divisible by 5.\n     - Check divisibility by 7: \\(493 \\div 7 = 70.428\\ldots\\), not divisible by 7.\n     - Check divisibility by 11: Alternating sum \\(4 - 9 + 3 = -2\\), not divisible by 11.\n     - Check divisibility by 13: \\(493 \\div 13 = 37.923\\ldots\\), not divisible by 13.\n     - Check divisibility by 17: \\(493 \\div 17 = 29\\), divisible by 17.\n     - So, \\(493 = 17 \\times 29\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(1479 = 3 \\times 17 \\times 29\\).\n\n   - **1740:**\n     - Check divisibility by 2: 1740 is even, divide by 2:\n       \\[\n       1740 \\div 2 = 870\n       \\]\n     - 870 is even, divide by 2 again:\n       \\[\n       870 \\div 2 = 435\n       \\]\n     - Check divisibility of 435 by 3: Sum of digits \\(4 + 3 + 5 = 12\\), divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:\n       \\[\n       435 \\div 3 = 145\n       \\]\n     - Check divisibility of 145 by 5: Ends in 5, divide by 5:\n       \\[\n       145 \\div 5 = 29\n       \\]\n     - 29 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, \\(1740 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 29\\).\n\n2. **Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors of 1479 and 1740 are 3 and 29.\n\n3. **Calculate GCD:**\n   - GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors:\n   \\[\n   \\text{GCD} = 3^1 \\times 29^1 = 87\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (87):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1479}{1740} = \\frac{1479 \\div 87}{1740 \\div 87} = \\frac{17}{20}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{17}{20}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{17}{20}\\)>>>"
