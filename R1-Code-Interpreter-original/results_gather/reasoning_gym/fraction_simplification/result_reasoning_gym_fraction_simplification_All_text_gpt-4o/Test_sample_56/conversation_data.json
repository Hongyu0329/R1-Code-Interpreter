    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{5100}{12475}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 5100:**\n   - 5100 is even, so divide by 2: \\(5100 \\div 2 = 2550\\)\n   - 2550 is even, so divide by 2: \\(2550 \\div 2 = 1275\\)\n   - 1275 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(1275 \\div 5 = 255\\)\n   - 255 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(255 \\div 5 = 51\\)\n   - 51 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 6): \\(51 \\div 3 = 17\\)\n   - 17 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 5100 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 3 \\times 17\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 12475:**\n   - 12475 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(12475 \\div 5 = 2495\\)\n   - 2495 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(2495 \\div 5 = 499\\)\n   - 499 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, etc.\n   - 499 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 12475 is \\(5^2 \\times 499\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors are \\(5^2\\).\n- Therefore, the GCD of 5100 and 12475 is \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (25):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5100}{12475} = \\frac{5100 \\div 25}{12475 \\div 25} = \\frac{204}{499}\n  \\]\n\n- Check if \\(\\frac{204}{499}\\) can be simplified further:\n  - 204: \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 17\\)\n  - 499 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 204.\n\nThus, \\(\\frac{204}{499}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{204}{499}\\)>>>"
