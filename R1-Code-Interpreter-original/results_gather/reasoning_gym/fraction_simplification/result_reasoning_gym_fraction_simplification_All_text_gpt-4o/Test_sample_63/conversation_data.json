    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{35970}{51414} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 35970 and 51414.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start by finding the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 35970:\n     - 35970 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 35970 \\div 2 = 17985 \\).\n     - 17985 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 17985 \\div 5 = 3597 \\).\n     - 3597 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 24, which is divisible by 3): \\( 3597 \\div 3 = 1199 \\).\n     - 1199 is divisible by 7 (using divisibility rule for 7): \\( 1199 \\div 7 = 171 \\).\n     - 171 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 9): \\( 171 \\div 3 = 57 \\).\n     - 57 is divisible by 3: \\( 57 \\div 3 = 19 \\).\n     - 19 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 35970 is \\( 2 \\times 3^3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 19 \\).\n\n   - For 51414:\n     - 51414 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 51414 \\div 2 = 25707 \\).\n     - 25707 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 21): \\( 25707 \\div 3 = 8569 \\).\n     - 8569 is divisible by 7 (using divisibility rule for 7): \\( 8569 \\div 7 = 1223 \\).\n     - 1223 is divisible by 13 (using divisibility rule for 13): \\( 1223 \\div 13 = 94 \\).\n     - 94 is divisible by 2: \\( 94 \\div 2 = 47 \\).\n     - 47 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 51414 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\times 47 \\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors: \\( 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 = 42 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (42):\n  - Numerator: \\( 35970 \\div 42 = 856 \\).\n  - Denominator: \\( 51414 \\div 42 = 1223 \\).\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{856}{1223} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<856/1223>>>"
