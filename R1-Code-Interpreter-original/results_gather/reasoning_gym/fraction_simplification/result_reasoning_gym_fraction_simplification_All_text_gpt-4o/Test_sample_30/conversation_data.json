    "To simplify the fraction 13570/21873 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers:**\n   - Numerator: 13570\n   - Denominator: 21873\n\n2. **Find the GCD:**\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 13570 and 21873.\n   - Start by dividing the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n   Steps:\n   - 21873 ÷ 13570 = 1 remainder 8313\n   - 13570 ÷ 8313 = 1 remainder 5257\n   - 8313 ÷ 5257 = 1 remainder 3056\n   - 5257 ÷ 3056 = 1 remainder 2201\n   - 3056 ÷ 2201 = 1 remainder 855\n   - 2201 ÷ 855 = 2 remainder 491\n   - 855 ÷ 491 = 1 remainder 364\n   - 491 ÷ 364 = 1 remainder 127\n   - 364 ÷ 127 = 2 remainder 110\n   - 127 ÷ 110 = 1 remainder 17\n   - 110 ÷ 17 = 6 remainder 8\n   - 17 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 1\n   - 8 ÷ 1 = 8 remainder 0\n\n   The GCD is 1.\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Since the GCD is 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The fraction 13570/21873 is already simplified.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<13570/21873>>>"
