    "To simplify the fraction 29330/37310 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\nStep 1: Identify the numerator and the denominator.\n- Numerator: 29330\n- Denominator: 37310\n\nStep 2: Find the GCD of 29330 and 37310.\n- Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n- Divide 37310 by 29330 and find the remainder.\n  - 37310 ÷ 29330 = 1 remainder 7980\n- Divide 29330 by 7980 and find the remainder.\n  - 29330 ÷ 7980 = 3 remainder 3590\n- Divide 7980 by 3590 and find the remainder.\n  - 7980 ÷ 3590 = 2 remainder 800\n- Divide 3590 by 800 and find the remainder.\n  - 3590 ÷ 800 = 4 remainder 390\n- Divide 800 by 390 and find the remainder.\n  - 800 ÷ 390 = 2 remainder 20\n- Divide 390 by 20 and find the remainder.\n  - 390 ÷ 20 = 19 remainder 10\n- Divide 20 by 10 and find the remainder.\n  - 20 ÷ 10 = 2 remainder 0\n\nWhen the remainder is 0, the divisor at this step is the GCD. Here, the GCD is 10.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n- Simplified numerator: 29330 ÷ 10 = 2933\n- Simplified denominator: 37310 ÷ 10 = 3731\n\nStep 5: Write the simplified fraction.\n- The simplified fraction is 2933/3731.\n\nTherefore, the fraction 29330/37310 simplified to its lowest terms is:\n\n<<<2933/3731>>>"
