    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{42398}{73358}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 42398 and 73358.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - This method involves finding the prime factors of each number and then identifying the common factors.\n   - However, for large numbers, this method can be cumbersome, so we often use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers.\n   - It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\n   Apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n   - Compute \\(73358 \\mod 42398\\).\n   - \\(73358 \\div 42398\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(73358 - 42398 = 30960\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(42398 \\mod 30960\\).\n   - \\(42398 \\div 30960\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(42398 - 30960 = 11438\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(30960 \\mod 11438\\).\n   - \\(30960 \\div 11438\\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of \\(30960 - 2 \\times 11438 = 8094\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(11438 \\mod 8094\\).\n   - \\(11438 \\div 8094\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(11438 - 8094 = 3344\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(8094 \\mod 3344\\).\n   - \\(8094 \\div 3344\\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of \\(8094 - 2 \\times 3344 = 1406\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(3344 \\mod 1406\\).\n   - \\(3344 \\div 1406\\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of \\(3344 - 2 \\times 1406 = 532\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(1406 \\mod 532\\).\n   - \\(1406 \\div 532\\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of \\(1406 - 2 \\times 532 = 342\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(532 \\mod 342\\).\n   - \\(532 \\div 342\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(532 - 342 = 190\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(342 \\mod 190\\).\n   - \\(342 \\div 190\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(342 - 190 = 152\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(190 \\mod 152\\).\n   - \\(190 \\div 152\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(190 - 152 = 38\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(152 \\mod 38\\).\n   - \\(152 \\div 38\\) gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of \\(152 - 4 \\times 38 = 0\\).\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 38, so the GCD of 42398 and 73358 is 38.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, 38:\n  - \\(\\frac{42398}{38} = 1115\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{73358}{38} = 1930\\)\n\nThus, the fraction \\(\\frac{42398}{73358}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{1115}{1930}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{1115}{1930}\\)>>>"
