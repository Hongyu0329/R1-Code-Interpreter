    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{2509}{10855}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 2509 and 10855.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - First, we need to check if 2509 and 10855 have any common prime factors.\n   - Start with the smaller number, 2509, and find its prime factors.\n   - Check divisibility by small prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.).\n\n2. **Divisibility Tests:**\n   - 2509 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits of 2509 is \\(2 + 5 + 0 + 9 = 16\\), not divisible by 3.\n   - Last digit is not 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, etc., until a factor is found.\n\n3. **Using the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:\n     - \\(10855 \\div 2509 = 4\\) remainder \\(1319\\).\n     - \\(2509 \\div 1319 = 1\\) remainder \\(1190\\).\n     - \\(1319 \\div 1190 = 1\\) remainder \\(129\\).\n     - \\(1190 \\div 129 = 9\\) remainder \\(29\\).\n     - \\(129 \\div 29 = 4\\) remainder \\(13\\).\n     - \\(29 \\div 13 = 2\\) remainder \\(3\\).\n     - \\(13 \\div 3 = 4\\) remainder \\(1\\).\n     - \\(3 \\div 1 = 3\\) remainder \\(0\\).\n\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 1, indicating that 2509 and 10855 are coprime.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\nSince the GCD of 2509 and 10855 is 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{2509}{10855}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{2509}{10855}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{2509}{10855}>>>"
