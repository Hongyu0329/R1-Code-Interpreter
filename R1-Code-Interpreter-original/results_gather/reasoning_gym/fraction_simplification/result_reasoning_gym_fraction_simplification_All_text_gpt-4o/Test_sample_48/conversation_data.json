    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{19530}{28280}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 19530 and 28280.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - First, we perform the prime factorization of both numbers.\n\n   - **19530:**\n     - 19530 is even, so divide by 2: \\(19530 \\div 2 = 9765\\).\n     - 9765 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 27, which is divisible by 3): \\(9765 \\div 3 = 3255\\).\n     - 3255 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 15): \\(3255 \\div 3 = 1085\\).\n     - 1085 is divisible by 5 (ends in 5): \\(1085 \\div 5 = 217\\).\n     - 217 is divisible by 7 (217 divided by 7 is exactly 31): \\(217 \\div 7 = 31\\).\n     - 31 is a prime number.\n\n     So, the prime factorization of 19530 is \\(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 31\\).\n\n   - **28280:**\n     - 28280 is even, so divide by 2: \\(28280 \\div 2 = 14140\\).\n     - 14140 is even, so divide by 2: \\(14140 \\div 2 = 7070\\).\n     - 7070 is even, so divide by 2: \\(7070 \\div 2 = 3535\\).\n     - 3535 is divisible by 5 (ends in 5): \\(3535 \\div 5 = 707\\).\n     - 707 is divisible by 7 (707 divided by 7 is exactly 101): \\(707 \\div 7 = 101\\).\n     - 101 is a prime number.\n\n     So, the prime factorization of 28280 is \\(2^3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 101\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - Common factors are \\(2\\), \\(5\\), and \\(7\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors:\n   - \\(GCD = 2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 = 70\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide Both Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - \\(\\frac{19530}{70} = 279\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{28280}{70} = 404\\).\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{279}{404}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{279}{404}\\)>>>"
