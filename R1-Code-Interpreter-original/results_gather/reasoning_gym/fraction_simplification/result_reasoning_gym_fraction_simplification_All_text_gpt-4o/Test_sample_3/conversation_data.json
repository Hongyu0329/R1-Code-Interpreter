    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{16684}{27257} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 16684 and 27257.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - This method involves finding the prime factors of both numbers and then identifying the common factors.\n   - However, for large numbers, this method can be cumbersome, so we often use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is a process to find the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm.\n   - We perform the division of the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n   - We then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - We repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n   Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm to 16684 and 27257:\n\n   - Divide 27257 by 16684:\n     \\[\n     27257 \\div 16684 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 27257 - 16684 \\times 1 = 10573\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide 16684 by 10573:\n     \\[\n     16684 \\div 10573 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 16684 - 10573 \\times 1 = 6111\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide 10573 by 6111:\n     \\[\n     10573 \\div 6111 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 10573 - 6111 \\times 1 = 4462\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide 6111 by 4462:\n     \\[\n     6111 \\div 4462 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 6111 - 4462 \\times 1 = 1649\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide 4462 by 1649:\n     \\[\n     4462 \\div 1649 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 4462 - 1649 \\times 2 = 1164\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide 1649 by 1164:\n     \\[\n     1649 \\div 1164 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 1649 - 1164 \\times 1 = 485\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide 1164 by 485:\n     \\[\n     1164 \\div 485 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 1164 - 485 \\times 2 = 194\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide 485 by 194:\n     \\[\n     485 \\div 194 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 485 - 194 \\times 2 = 97\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide 194 by 97:\n     \\[\n     194 \\div 97 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 194 - 97 \\times 2 = 0\n     \\]\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 97, so the GCD of 16684 and 27257 is 97.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (97):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16684}{97} = 172\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{27257}{97} = 281\n  \\]\n\nThus, the fraction \\( \\frac{16684}{27257} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{172}{281} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<172/281>>>"
