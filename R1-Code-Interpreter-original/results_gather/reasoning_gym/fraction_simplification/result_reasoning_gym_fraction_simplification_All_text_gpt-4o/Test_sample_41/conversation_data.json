    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{1170}{2665}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 1170 and 2665.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 1170:**\n   - 1170 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1170 \\div 2 = 585\\).\n   - 585 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18, which is divisible by 3): \\(585 \\div 3 = 195\\).\n   - 195 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 15, which is divisible by 3): \\(195 \\div 3 = 65\\).\n   - 65 is divisible by 5 (ends in 5): \\(65 \\div 5 = 13\\).\n   - 13 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 1170 is \\(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 13\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 2665:**\n   - 2665 is not even, so not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits is 19, not divisible by 3.\n   - Ends in 5, so divisible by 5: \\(2665 \\div 5 = 533\\).\n   - 533 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 11).\n   - 533 is not divisible by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5).\n   - 533 is divisible by 13 (since \\(533 \\div 13 = 41\\)).\n   - 41 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 2665 is \\(5 \\times 13 \\times 41\\).\n\n3. **Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors of 1170 and 2665 are 5 and 13.\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of all common prime factors: \\(5 \\times 13 = 65\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - \\(\\frac{1170}{65} = 18\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{2665}{65} = 41\\).\n\nThus, the fraction \\(\\frac{1170}{2665}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{18}{41}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{18}{41}\\)>>>"
