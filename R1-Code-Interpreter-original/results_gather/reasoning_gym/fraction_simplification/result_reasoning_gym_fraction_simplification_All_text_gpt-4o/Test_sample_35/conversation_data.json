    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{1089}{1683}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 1089:**\n   - Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 1089 is \\(1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 1089 by 3: \\(1089 \\div 3 = 363\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 363 by 3: The sum of the digits of 363 is \\(3 + 6 + 3 = 12\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 363 by 3: \\(363 \\div 3 = 121\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 121 by 3: The sum of the digits of 121 is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\), which is not divisible by 3.\n   - Check divisibility of 121 by 11: 121 is \\(11 \\times 11\\).\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 1089 is \\(3^2 \\times 11^2\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 1683:**\n   - Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 1683 is \\(1 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 1683 by 3: \\(1683 \\div 3 = 561\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 561 by 3: The sum of the digits of 561 is \\(5 + 6 + 1 = 12\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide 561 by 3: \\(561 \\div 3 = 187\\).\n   - Check divisibility of 187 by 3: The sum of the digits of 187 is \\(1 + 8 + 7 = 16\\), which is not divisible by 3.\n   - Check divisibility of 187 by 11: The alternating sum of the digits is \\(1 - 8 + 7 = 0\\), which is divisible by 11.\n   - Divide 187 by 11: \\(187 \\div 11 = 17\\).\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 1683 is \\(3^2 \\times 11 \\times 17\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors of 1089 and 1683 are \\(3^2\\) and \\(11\\).\n- Therefore, the GCD is \\(3^2 \\times 11 = 99\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (99):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1089}{1683} = \\frac{1089 \\div 99}{1683 \\div 99} = \\frac{11}{17}\n  \\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{11}{17}\\) is in its lowest terms because 11 and 17 are both prime numbers and have no common factors other than 1.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{11}{17}\\)>>>"
