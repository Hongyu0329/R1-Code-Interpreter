    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{30621}{50740}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 30621 and 50740.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - Prime factorize both numbers and find the common factors.\n   - This method can be cumbersome for large numbers, so we will use the Euclidean algorithm instead.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers.\n   - It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Euclidean Algorithm.**\n\n1. Divide 50740 by 30621 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   50740 \\div 30621 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 50740 - 30621 \\times 1 = 20119\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide 30621 by 20119 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   30621 \\div 20119 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 30621 - 20119 \\times 1 = 10502\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide 20119 by 10502 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   20119 \\div 10502 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 20119 - 10502 \\times 1 = 9617\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide 10502 by 9617 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   10502 \\div 9617 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 10502 - 9617 \\times 1 = 885\n   \\]\n\n5. Divide 9617 by 885 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   9617 \\div 885 = 10 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 9617 - 885 \\times 10 = 767\n   \\]\n\n6. Divide 885 by 767 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   885 \\div 767 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 885 - 767 \\times 1 = 118\n   \\]\n\n7. Divide 767 by 118 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   767 \\div 118 = 6 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 767 - 118 \\times 6 = 65\n   \\]\n\n8. Divide 118 by 65 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   118 \\div 65 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 118 - 65 \\times 1 = 53\n   \\]\n\n9. Divide 65 by 53 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   65 \\div 53 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 65 - 53 \\times 1 = 12\n   \\]\n\n10. Divide 53 by 12 and find the remainder:\n    \\[\n    53 \\div 12 = 4 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 53 - 12 \\times 4 = 5\n    \\]\n\n11. Divide 12 by 5 and find the remainder:\n    \\[\n    12 \\div 5 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 12 - 5 \\times 2 = 2\n    \\]\n\n12. Divide 5 by 2 and find the remainder:\n    \\[\n    5 \\div 2 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 5 - 2 \\times 2 = 1\n    \\]\n\n13. Divide 2 by 1 and find the remainder:\n    \\[\n    2 \\div 1 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 2 - 1 \\times 2 = 0\n    \\]\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 30621 and 50740 is 1.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\nSince the GCD is 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{30621}{50740}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{30621}{50740}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{30621}{50740}>>>"
