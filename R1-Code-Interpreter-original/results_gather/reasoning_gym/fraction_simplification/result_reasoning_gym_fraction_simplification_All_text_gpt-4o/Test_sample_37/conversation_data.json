    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{507}{9113} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the numerator and the denominator.**\n- Numerator: 507\n- Denominator: 9113\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD of 507 and 9113.**\n- We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.**\n- Start with the numbers 9113 and 507.\n- Divide 9113 by 507 and find the remainder.\n  \\[\n  9113 \\div 507 = 17 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 9113 - 507 \\times 17 = 506\n  \\]\n- Now, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 507 and 506.\n  \\[\n  507 \\div 506 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 507 - 506 \\times 1 = 1\n  \\]\n- Apply the Euclidean algorithm to 506 and 1.\n  \\[\n  506 \\div 1 = 506 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 506 - 1 \\times 506 = 0\n  \\]\n- The last non-zero remainder is 1, so the GCD of 507 and 9113 is 1.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the fraction.**\n- Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \\( \\frac{507}{9113} \\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe fraction \\( \\frac{507}{9113} \\) is already simplified to its lowest terms.\n\n<<<507/9113>>>"
