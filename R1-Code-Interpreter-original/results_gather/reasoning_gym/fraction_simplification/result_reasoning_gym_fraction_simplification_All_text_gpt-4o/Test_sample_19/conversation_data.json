    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{16250}{55835} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 16250:**\n   - 16250 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 16250 \\div 2 = 8125 \\).\n   - 8125 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 8125 \\div 5 = 1625 \\).\n   - 1625 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 1625 \\div 5 = 325 \\).\n   - 325 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 325 \\div 5 = 65 \\).\n   - 65 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 65 \\div 5 = 13 \\).\n   - 13 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 16250 is \\( 2 \\times 5^4 \\times 13 \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 55835:**\n   - 55835 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 55835 \\div 5 = 11167 \\).\n   - 11167 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7: \\( 11167 \\div 7 = 1595 \\) (not an integer).\n   - Check divisibility by 11: \\( 11167 \\div 11 = 1015.18 \\) (not an integer).\n   - Check divisibility by 13: \\( 11167 \\div 13 = 859 \\) (integer).\n   - 859 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 55835 is \\( 5 \\times 13 \\times 859 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors of 16250 and 55835 are 5 and 13.\n- The lowest power of each common factor is:\n  - For 5: \\( 5^1 \\)\n  - For 13: \\( 13^1 \\)\n\nThus, the GCD is \\( 5 \\times 13 = 65 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (65):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16250}{65} = 250\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{55835}{65} = 859\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{250}{859} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<250/859>>>"
