    "To simplify the fraction 41316/58146 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: \n   - Numerator: 41316\n   - Denominator: 58146\n\n2. **Find the GCD**:\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 41316 and 58146.\n   - The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Divide 58146 by 41316, which gives a quotient and a remainder.\n   - 58146 ÷ 41316 = 1 remainder 16830\n   - Now, divide 41316 by 16830.\n   - 41316 ÷ 16830 = 2 remainder 7656\n   - Next, divide 16830 by 7656.\n   - 16830 ÷ 7656 = 2 remainder 1518\n   - Then, divide 7656 by 1518.\n   - 7656 ÷ 1518 = 5 remainder 126\n   - Next, divide 1518 by 126.\n   - 1518 ÷ 126 = 12 remainder 0\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD, which is 126.\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (126).\n   - 41316 ÷ 126 = 328\n   - 58146 ÷ 126 = 461\n\n5. **Write the Simplified Fraction**:\n   - The simplified fraction is 328/461.\n\nTherefore, the fraction 41316/58146 simplified to its lowest terms is:\n\n<<<328/461>>>"
