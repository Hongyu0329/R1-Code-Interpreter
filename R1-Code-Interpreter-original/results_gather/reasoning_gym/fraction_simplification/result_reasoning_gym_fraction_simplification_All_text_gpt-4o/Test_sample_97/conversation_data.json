    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{40267}{59563}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have the fraction \\(\\frac{40267}{59563}\\).\n\n2. **Find the GCD**: \n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 40267 and 59563.\n   - The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders:\n     - Divide 59563 by 40267, which gives a quotient and a remainder.\n     - Replace 59563 with 40267 and 40267 with the remainder.\n     - Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - \\(59563 \\div 40267 = 1\\) remainder \\(19296\\).\n   - \\(40267 \\div 19296 = 2\\) remainder \\(1675\\).\n   - \\(19296 \\div 1675 = 11\\) remainder \\(821\\).\n   - \\(1675 \\div 821 = 2\\) remainder \\(33\\).\n   - \\(821 \\div 33 = 24\\) remainder \\(28\\).\n   - \\(33 \\div 28 = 1\\) remainder \\(5\\).\n   - \\(28 \\div 5 = 5\\) remainder \\(3\\).\n   - \\(5 \\div 3 = 1\\) remainder \\(2\\).\n   - \\(3 \\div 2 = 1\\) remainder \\(1\\).\n   - \\(2 \\div 1 = 2\\) remainder \\(0\\).\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 40267 and 59563 is 1.\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{40267}{59563}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{40267}{59563}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{40267}{59563}>>>"
