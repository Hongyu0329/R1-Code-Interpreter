    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{6552}{61386}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 6552:**\n   - 6552 is even, so divide by 2: \\(6552 \\div 2 = 3276\\)\n   - 3276 is even, so divide by 2: \\(3276 \\div 2 = 1638\\)\n   - 1638 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1638 \\div 2 = 819\\)\n   - 819 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18, which is divisible by 3): \\(819 \\div 3 = 273\\)\n   - 273 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 12, which is divisible by 3): \\(273 \\div 3 = 91\\)\n   - 91 is divisible by 7: \\(91 \\div 7 = 13\\)\n   - 13 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 6552 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 13\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 61386:**\n   - 61386 is even, so divide by 2: \\(61386 \\div 2 = 30693\\)\n   - 30693 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 21, which is divisible by 3): \\(30693 \\div 3 = 10231\\)\n   - 10231 is divisible by 11 (alternating sum of digits is 0, which is divisible by 11): \\(10231 \\div 11 = 929\\)\n   - 929 is divisible by 13: \\(929 \\div 13 = 71\\)\n   - 71 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 61386 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 71\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors are: \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(13\\).\n- The lowest power of each common factor is:\n  - \\(2^1\\)\n  - \\(3^1\\)\n  - \\(13^1\\)\n\n- Therefore, the GCD is \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 13^1 = 78\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (78):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6552}{78} = 84\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{61386}{78} = 787\n  \\]\n\n- Therefore, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{84}{787}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{84}{787}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{84}{787}>>>"
