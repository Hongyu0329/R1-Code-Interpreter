    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3640}{20216}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 3640 and 20216.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the numerator, 3640:\n     - 3640 is even, so divide by 2: \\(3640 \\div 2 = 1820\\)\n     - 1820 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1820 \\div 2 = 910\\)\n     - 910 is even, so divide by 2: \\(910 \\div 2 = 455\\)\n     - 455 is not even, check divisibility by 5: \\(455 \\div 5 = 91\\)\n     - 91 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, check divisibility by 7: \\(91 \\div 7 = 13\\)\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 3640: \\(2^3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13\\)\n\n   - Now for the denominator, 20216:\n     - 20216 is even, so divide by 2: \\(20216 \\div 2 = 10108\\)\n     - 10108 is even, so divide by 2: \\(10108 \\div 2 = 5054\\)\n     - 5054 is even, so divide by 2: \\(5054 \\div 2 = 2527\\)\n     - 2527 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, check divisibility by 7: \\(2527 \\div 7 = 361\\)\n     - 361 is \\(19 \\times 19\\) (since \\(19^2 = 361\\))\n     - Prime factorization of 20216: \\(2^3 \\times 7 \\times 19^2\\)\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - Common prime factors: \\(2^3\\) and \\(7\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors:\n   - GCD = \\(2^3 \\times 7 = 8 \\times 7 = 56\\)\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - \\(\\frac{3640}{56} = 65\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{20216}{56} = 361\\)\n\n2. **Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{3640}{20216}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{65}{361}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{65}{361}\\).\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{65}{361}\\)>>>"
