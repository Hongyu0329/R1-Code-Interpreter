    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{5208}{25575}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 5208:**\n   - 5208 is even, so divide by 2: \\(5208 \\div 2 = 2604\\)\n   - 2604 is even, so divide by 2: \\(2604 \\div 2 = 1302\\)\n   - 1302 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1302 \\div 2 = 651\\)\n   - 651 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits \\(6 + 5 + 1 = 12\\), divisible by 3): \\(651 \\div 3 = 217\\)\n   - 217 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 7: \\(217 \\div 7 = 31\\)\n   - 31 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 5208 is \\(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 31\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 25575:**\n   - 25575 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits \\(2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 5 = 24\\), divisible by 3): \\(25575 \\div 3 = 8525\\)\n   - 8525 is not even, check divisibility by 5 (last digit is 5): \\(8525 \\div 5 = 1705\\)\n   - 1705 is not even, check divisibility by 5 (last digit is 5): \\(1705 \\div 5 = 341\\)\n   - 341 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 11 (alternating sum \\(3 - 4 + 1 = 0\\), divisible by 11): \\(341 \\div 11 = 31\\)\n   - 31 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 25575 is \\(3 \\times 5^2 \\times 11 \\times 31\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors are \\(3\\) and \\(31\\).\n- The GCD is \\(3 \\times 31 = 93\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (93):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5208}{93} = 56\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{25575}{93} = 275\n  \\]\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{56}{275}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{56}{275}\\)>>>"
