    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{5936}{6804}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 5936:**\n   - 5936 is even, so divide by 2: \\(5936 \\div 2 = 2968\\)\n   - 2968 is even, so divide by 2: \\(2968 \\div 2 = 1484\\)\n   - 1484 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1484 \\div 2 = 742\\)\n   - 742 is even, so divide by 2: \\(742 \\div 2 = 371\\)\n   - 371 is not even, check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\(3 + 7 + 1 = 11\\), not divisible by 3.\n   - Check divisibility by 5: last digit is not 0 or 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7: \\(371 \\div 7 \\approx 53\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 11: alternating sum \\(3 - 7 + 1 = -3\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 13: \\(371 \\div 13 = 28.538\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 17: \\(371 \\div 17 = 21.823\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 19: \\(371 \\div 19 = 19.526\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 23: \\(371 \\div 23 = 16.130\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 29: \\(371 \\div 29 = 12.793\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 31: \\(371 \\div 31 = 11.968\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 37: \\(371 \\div 37 = 10.027\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 41: \\(371 \\div 41 = 9.049\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 43: \\(371 \\div 43 = 8.628\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 47: \\(371 \\div 47 = 7.894\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 53: \\(371 \\div 53 = 7\\), divisible.\n   - So, \\(371 = 53 \\times 7\\).\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 5936 is \\(2^4 \\times 53 \\times 7\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 6804:**\n   - 6804 is even, so divide by 2: \\(6804 \\div 2 = 3402\\)\n   - 3402 is even, so divide by 2: \\(3402 \\div 2 = 1701\\)\n   - 1701 is not even, check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\(1 + 7 + 0 + 1 = 9\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(1701 \\div 3 = 567\\)\n   - 567 is divisible by 3: sum of digits \\(5 + 6 + 7 = 18\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(567 \\div 3 = 189\\)\n   - 189 is divisible by 3: sum of digits \\(1 + 8 + 9 = 18\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(189 \\div 3 = 63\\)\n   - 63 is divisible by 3: sum of digits \\(6 + 3 = 9\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(63 \\div 3 = 21\\)\n   - 21 is divisible by 3: sum of digits \\(2 + 1 = 3\\), divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(21 \\div 3 = 7\\)\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 6804 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^5 \\times 7\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors are \\(2\\) and \\(7\\).\n- The lowest power of 2 common to both is \\(2^2\\).\n- The lowest power of 7 common to both is \\(7^1\\).\n\nThus, the GCD is \\(2^2 \\times 7 = 28\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5936}{6804} = \\frac{5936 \\div 28}{6804 \\div 28} = \\frac{212}{243}\n\\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{212}{243}\\) is in its simplest form because 212 and 243 have no common factors other than 1.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{212}{243}\\)>>>"
