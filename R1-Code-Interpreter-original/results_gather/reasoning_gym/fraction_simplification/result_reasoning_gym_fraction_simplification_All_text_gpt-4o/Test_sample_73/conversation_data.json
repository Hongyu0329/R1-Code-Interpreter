    "To simplify the fraction 4545/6750 to its lowest terms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** \n   - The first step in simplifying a fraction is to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Perform prime factorization of both the numerator (4545) and the denominator (6750) to find their common factors.\n   - 4545: \n     - 4545 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5), so divide by 5: 4545 ÷ 5 = 909.\n     - 909 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits 9+0+9 = 18, which is divisible by 3), so divide by 3: 909 ÷ 3 = 303.\n     - 303 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits 3+0+3 = 6, which is divisible by 3), so divide by 3: 303 ÷ 3 = 101.\n     - 101 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 4545 is 5 × 3² × 101.\n\n   - 6750:\n     - 6750 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 0), so divide by 5: 6750 ÷ 5 = 1350.\n     - 1350 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 0), so divide by 5: 1350 ÷ 5 = 270.\n     - 270 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 0), so divide by 5: 270 ÷ 5 = 54.\n     - 54 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits 5+4 = 9, which is divisible by 3), so divide by 3: 54 ÷ 3 = 18.\n     - 18 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits 1+8 = 9, which is divisible by 3), so divide by 3: 18 ÷ 3 = 6.\n     - 6 is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: 6 ÷ 3 = 2.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6750 is 5² × 3³ × 2.\n\n3. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - From the prime factorizations, identify the common factors:\n     - Common factors are 5 and 3.\n     - The lowest power of each common factor is 5¹ and 3².\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common factors: \n     - GCD = 5¹ × 3² = 5 × 9 = 45.\n\n5. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:\n     - Simplified numerator: 4545 ÷ 45 = 101.\n     - Simplified denominator: 6750 ÷ 45 = 150.\n\n6. **Write the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The fraction 4545/6750 simplified to its lowest terms is 101/150.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<101/150>>>"
