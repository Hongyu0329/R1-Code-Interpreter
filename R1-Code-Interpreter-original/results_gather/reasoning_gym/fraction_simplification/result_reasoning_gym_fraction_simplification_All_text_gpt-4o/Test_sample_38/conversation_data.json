    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{2318}{17708}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 2318 and 17708.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the numerator, 2318.\n     - 2318 is even, so divide by 2: \\(2318 \\div 2 = 1159\\).\n     - Check 1159 for divisibility by 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n     - 1159 is divisible by 11: \\(1159 \\div 11 = 105\\).\n     - 105 is divisible by 3: \\(105 \\div 3 = 35\\).\n     - 35 is divisible by 5: \\(35 \\div 5 = 7\\).\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 2318 is \\(2 \\times 11 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\\).\n\n   - Now, for the denominator, 17708.\n     - 17708 is even, so divide by 2: \\(17708 \\div 2 = 8854\\).\n     - 8854 is even, so divide by 2: \\(8854 \\div 2 = 4427\\).\n     - Check 4427 for divisibility by 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n     - 4427 is divisible by 11: \\(4427 \\div 11 = 403\\).\n     - 403 is divisible by 13: \\(403 \\div 13 = 31\\).\n     - 31 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 17708 is \\(2^2 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 31\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors between 2318 and 17708 are 2 and 11.\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors.\n   - GCD = \\(2^1 \\times 11^1 = 22\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - Simplified numerator: \\(2318 \\div 22 = 105\\).\n   - Simplified denominator: \\(17708 \\div 22 = 805\\).\n\n2. **Resulting Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{2318}{17708}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{105}{805}\\).\n\n3. **Check for Further Simplification:**\n   - Check if 105 and 805 have any common factors.\n   - The GCD of 105 and 805 is 1, indicating that \\(\\frac{105}{805}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{105}{805}\\)>>>"
