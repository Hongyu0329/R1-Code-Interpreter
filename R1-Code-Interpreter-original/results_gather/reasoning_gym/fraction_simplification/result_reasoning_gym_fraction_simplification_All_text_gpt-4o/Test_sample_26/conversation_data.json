    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{5454}{16065} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 5454:**\n   - Check divisibility by 2: 5454 is even, so divide by 2.\n     \\[\n     5454 \\div 2 = 2727\n     \\]\n   - Check divisibility of 2727 by 3: Sum of digits \\(2 + 7 + 2 + 7 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n     \\[\n     2727 \\div 3 = 909\n     \\]\n   - Check divisibility of 909 by 3: Sum of digits \\(9 + 0 + 9 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n     \\[\n     909 \\div 3 = 303\n     \\]\n   - Check divisibility of 303 by 3: Sum of digits \\(3 + 0 + 3 = 6\\), which is divisible by 3.\n     \\[\n     303 \\div 3 = 101\n     \\]\n   - 101 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 5454 is \\(2 \\times 3^3 \\times 101\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 16065:**\n   - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \\(1 + 6 + 0 + 6 + 5 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n     \\[\n     16065 \\div 3 = 5355\n     \\]\n   - Check divisibility of 5355 by 3: Sum of digits \\(5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n     \\[\n     5355 \\div 3 = 1785\n     \\]\n   - Check divisibility of 1785 by 3: Sum of digits \\(1 + 7 + 8 + 5 = 21\\), which is divisible by 3.\n     \\[\n     1785 \\div 3 = 595\n     \\]\n   - Check divisibility of 595 by 5: Ends in 5.\n     \\[\n     595 \\div 5 = 119\n     \\]\n   - Check divisibility of 119 by 7: \\(119 \\div 7 = 17\\), and 17 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 16065 is \\(3^3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 17\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- Common prime factors: \\(3^3\\).\n- GCD is \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (27):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5454}{27} = 202\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16065}{27} = 595\n  \\]\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{202}{595}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{202}{595}\\)>>>"
