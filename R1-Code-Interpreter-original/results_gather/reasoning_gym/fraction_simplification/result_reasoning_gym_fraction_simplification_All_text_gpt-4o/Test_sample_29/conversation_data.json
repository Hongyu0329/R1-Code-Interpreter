    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{13464}{36504} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 13464 and 36504.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the smaller number, 13464.\n     - 13464 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 13464 \\div 2 = 6732 \\).\n     - 6732 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 6732 \\div 2 = 3366 \\).\n     - 3366 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 3366 \\div 2 = 1683 \\).\n     - 1683 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18, which is divisible by 3): \\( 1683 \\div 3 = 561 \\).\n     - 561 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 12, which is divisible by 3): \\( 561 \\div 3 = 187 \\).\n     - 187 is divisible by 11 (alternating sum of digits is 0, which is divisible by 11): \\( 187 \\div 11 = 17 \\).\n     - 17 is a prime number.\n   - Prime factorization of 13464: \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 11 \\times 17 \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 36504:**\n   - 36504 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 36504 \\div 2 = 18252 \\).\n   - 18252 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 18252 \\div 2 = 9126 \\).\n   - 9126 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 9126 \\div 2 = 4563 \\).\n   - 4563 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18, which is divisible by 3): \\( 4563 \\div 3 = 1521 \\).\n   - 1521 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 3): \\( 1521 \\div 3 = 507 \\).\n   - 507 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 12, which is divisible by 3): \\( 507 \\div 3 = 169 \\).\n   - 169 is \\( 13^2 \\).\n   - Prime factorization of 36504: \\( 2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 13^2 \\).\n\n3. **Find the GCD:**\n   - Compare the prime factorizations:\n     - Common factors: \\( 2^3 \\) and \\( 3^2 \\).\n   - GCD is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 = 8 \\times 9 = 72 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (72):\n  - \\( \\frac{13464}{72} = 187 \\).\n  - \\( \\frac{36504}{72} = 507 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Verify if the fraction can be simplified further.**\n\n- Check if 187 and 507 have any common factors:\n  - 187 is \\( 11 \\times 17 \\).\n  - 507 is \\( 3 \\times 13^2 \\).\n  - No common factors other than 1.\n\nThus, the fraction \\( \\frac{13464}{36504} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{187}{507} \\).\n\n<<<187/507>>>"
