    "To simplify the fraction 240/528 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this number. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numerator and Denominator:**\n   - Numerator: 240\n   - Denominator: 528\n\n2. **Find the GCD of 240 and 528:**\n   - List the prime factors of each number.\n   - Prime factorization of 240:\n     - 240 is even, divide by 2: 240 ÷ 2 = 120\n     - 120 is even, divide by 2: 120 ÷ 2 = 60\n     - 60 is even, divide by 2: 60 ÷ 2 = 30\n     - 30 is even, divide by 2: 30 ÷ 2 = 15\n     - 15 is divisible by 3: 15 ÷ 3 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 240: 2^4 × 3 × 5\n\n   - Prime factorization of 528:\n     - 528 is even, divide by 2: 528 ÷ 2 = 264\n     - 264 is even, divide by 2: 264 ÷ 2 = 132\n     - 132 is even, divide by 2: 132 ÷ 2 = 66\n     - 66 is even, divide by 2: 66 ÷ 2 = 33\n     - 33 is divisible by 3: 33 ÷ 3 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 528: 2^4 × 3 × 11\n\n3. **Determine the GCD:**\n   - Compare the prime factors: 2^4 × 3\n   - The common prime factors are 2^4 and 3.\n   - GCD = 2^4 × 3 = 16 × 3 = 48\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (48):\n     - Simplified numerator: 240 ÷ 48 = 5\n     - Simplified denominator: 528 ÷ 48 = 11\n\n5. **Write the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The fraction 240/528 simplified to its lowest terms is 5/11.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<5/11>>>"
