    "To simplify the fraction 3657/18709 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have the fraction 3657/18709.\n\n2. **Find the GCD**: \n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 3657 and 18709.\n   - Start by dividing 18709 by 3657 and find the remainder.\n   - Continue the process with the divisor and the remainder until the remainder is 0.\n   - The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - 18709 ÷ 3657 = 5 remainder 2380\n   - 3657 ÷ 2380 = 1 remainder 1277\n   - 2380 ÷ 1277 = 1 remainder 1103\n   - 1277 ÷ 1103 = 1 remainder 174\n   - 1103 ÷ 174 = 6 remainder 59\n   - 174 ÷ 59 = 2 remainder 56\n   - 59 ÷ 56 = 1 remainder 3\n   - 56 ÷ 3 = 18 remainder 2\n   - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n   - 2 ÷ 1 = 2 remainder 0\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 1, so the GCD of 3657 and 18709 is 1.\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - Since the GCD is 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The fraction 3657/18709 cannot be simplified further.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<3657/18709>>>"
