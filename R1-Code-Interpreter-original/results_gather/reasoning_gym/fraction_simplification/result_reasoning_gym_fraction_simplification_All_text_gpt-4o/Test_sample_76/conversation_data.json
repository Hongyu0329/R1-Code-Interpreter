    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{1474}{8063}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 1474 and 8063.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start by finding the prime factorization of 1474 and 8063.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 1474:**\n   - 1474 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1474 \\div 2 = 737\\).\n   - Check if 737 is divisible by 3, 5, 7, etc.\n   - 737 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7.\n   - Check divisibility by 11: \\(737 \\div 11 = 67\\).\n   - 67 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 1474 is \\(2 \\times 11 \\times 67\\).\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 8063:**\n   - 8063 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n   - Check divisibility by 3, 5, 7, etc.\n   - 8063 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61.\n   - Check divisibility by 67: \\(8063 \\div 67 = 120.358\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 67 again: \\(8063 \\div 67 = 120.358\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 67: \\(8063 \\div 67 = 120.358\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 67: \\(8063 \\div 67 = 120.358\\), not divisible.\n   -
