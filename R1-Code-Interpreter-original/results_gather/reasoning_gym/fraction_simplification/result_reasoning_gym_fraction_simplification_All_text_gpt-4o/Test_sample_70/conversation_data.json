    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{12008}{54747}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 12008 and 54747.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - Prime factorize both numbers and find the common factors.\n   - However, this method can be cumbersome for large numbers, so we will use the Euclidean algorithm instead.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers.\n   - It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\n   - Apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n     - \\(54747 \\div 12008\\) gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 6715.\n     - \\(12008 \\div 6715\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 5293.\n     - \\(6715 \\div 5293\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1422.\n     - \\(5293 \\div 1422\\) gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 27.\n     - \\(1422 \\div 27\\) gives a quotient of 52 and a remainder of 18.\n     - \\(27 \\div 18\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 9.\n     - \\(18 \\div 9\\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.\n\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 9, which is the GCD of 12008 and 54747.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (9):\n  - \\(\\frac{12008}{9} = 1334\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{54747}{9} = 6083\\)\n\n- Therefore, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{1334}{6083}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{1334}{6083}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{1334}{6083}>>>"
