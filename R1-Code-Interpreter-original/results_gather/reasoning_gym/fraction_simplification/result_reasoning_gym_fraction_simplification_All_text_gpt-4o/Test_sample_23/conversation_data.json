    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{2418}{25324} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 2418 and 25324.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the smaller number, 2418.\n   - Check divisibility by 2: 2418 is even, so divide by 2.\n     \\[\n     2418 \\div 2 = 1209\n     \\]\n   - 1209 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits \\(1 + 2 + 0 + 9 = 12\\), which is divisible by 3).\n     \\[\n     1209 \\div 3 = 403\n     \\]\n   - 403 is not divisible by 3, check divisibility by 5 (last digit is not 0 or 5).\n   - Check divisibility by 7: \\(403 \\div 7 \\approx 57.57\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 11: \\(403 \\div 11 \\approx 36.63\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 13: \\(403 \\div 13 = 31\\), which is an integer.\n   - 31 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 2418 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 13 \\times 31\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 25324:**\n   - 25324 is even, divide by 2.\n     \\[\n     25324 \\div 2 = 12662\n     \\]\n   - 12662 is even, divide by 2 again.\n     \\[\n     12662 \\div 2 = 6331\n     \\]\n   - 6331 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits \\(6 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 13\\), not divisible by 3).\n   - Check divisibility by 5 (last digit is not 0 or 5).\n   - Check divisibility by 7: \\(6331 \\div 7 \\approx 904.43\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 11: \\(6331 \\div 11 \\approx 575.55\\), not divisible.\n   - Check divisibility by 13: \\(6331 \\div 13 = 487\\), which is an integer.\n   - 487 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 25324 is \\(2^2 \\times 13 \\times 487\\).\n\n3. **Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors are 2 and 13.\n\n4. **Calculate GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors.\n   - GCD = \\(2^1 \\times 13^1 = 26\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (26):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2418}{25324} = \\frac{2418 \\div 26}{25324 \\div 26} = \\frac{93}{974}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Verify if Further Simplification is Possible.**\n\n- Check if 93 and 974 have any common factors:\n  - Prime factorization of 93: \\(3 \\times 31\\).\n  - Prime factorization of 974: \\(2 \\times 487\\).\n  - No common factors other than 1.\n\nThus, the fraction \\( \\frac{93}{974} \\) is in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<93/974>>>"
