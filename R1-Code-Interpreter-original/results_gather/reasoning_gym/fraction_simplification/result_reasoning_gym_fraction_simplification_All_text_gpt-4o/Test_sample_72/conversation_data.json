    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{546}{25558} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 546 and 25558.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 546:**\n   - 546 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 546 \\div 2 = 273 \\).\n   - 273 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits \\( 2 + 7 + 3 = 12 \\), which is divisible by 3): \\( 273 \\div 3 = 91 \\).\n   - 91 is divisible by 7 (since \\( 91 \\div 7 = 13 \\)).\n   - 13 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 546 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 25558:**\n   - 25558 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 25558 \\div 2 = 12779 \\).\n   - 12779 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits \\( 1 + 2 + 7 + 7 + 9 = 26 \\), which is not divisible by 3).\n   - 12779 is not divisible by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5).\n   - Check divisibility by 7: \\( 12779 \\div 7 \\approx 1825.57 \\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 11: \\( 12779 \\div 11 \\approx 1161.73 \\) (not divisible).\n   - Check divisibility by 13: \\( 12779 \\div 13 = 983 \\).\n   - 983 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 25558 is \\( 2 \\times 13 \\times 983 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the GCD.**\n\n- The common prime factors of 546 and 25558 are 2 and 13.\n- Therefore, the GCD is \\( 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (26):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{546}{25558} = \\frac{546 \\div 26}{25558 \\div 26} = \\frac{21}{983}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Verify that the fraction is in its lowest terms.**\n\n- 21 is \\( 3 \\times 7 \\).\n- 983 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 21 other than 1.\n\nThus, the fraction \\( \\frac{21}{983} \\) is in its simplest form.\n\nThe simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<21/983>>>"
