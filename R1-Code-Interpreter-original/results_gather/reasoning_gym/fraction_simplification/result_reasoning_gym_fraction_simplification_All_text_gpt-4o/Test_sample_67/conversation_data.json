    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{1690}{1794} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 1690 and 1794.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - **1690:**\n     - 1690 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 1690 \\div 2 = 845 \\).\n     - 845 is not divisible by 2. Check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\( 8 + 4 + 5 = 17 \\), not divisible by 3.\n     - Check divisibility by 5: last digit is 5, so divide by 5: \\( 845 \\div 5 = 169 \\).\n     - 169 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 13: \\( 169 \\div 13 = 13 \\).\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 1690: \\( 2 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\times 13 \\).\n\n   - **1794:**\n     - 1794 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 1794 \\div 2 = 897 \\).\n     - 897 is not divisible by 2. Check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\( 8 + 9 + 7 = 24 \\), divisible by 3. Divide by 3: \\( 897 \\div 3 = 299 \\).\n     - 299 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 13: \\( 299 \\div 13 = 23 \\).\n     - 23 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 1794: \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\).\n\n2. **Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factor is 13.\n\n3. **GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 1690 and 1794 is 13.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (13):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1690 \\div 13}{1794 \\div 13} = \\frac{130}{138}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify Further if Possible.**\n\n1. **Find the GCD of 130 and 138:**\n\n   - **130:**\n     - 130 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 130 \\div 2 = 65 \\).\n     - 65 is not divisible by 2. Check divisibility by 5: last digit is 5, so divide by 5: \\( 65 \\div 5 = 13 \\).\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 130: \\( 2 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\).\n\n   - **138:**\n     - 138 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 138 \\div 2 = 69 \\).\n     - 69 is not divisible by 2. Check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\( 6 + 9 = 15 \\), divisible by 3. Divide by 3: \\( 69 \\div 3 = 23 \\).\n     - 23 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 138: \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 23 \\).\n\n2. **Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factor is 2.\n\n3. **GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 130 and 138 is 2.\n\n4. **Simplify Further:**\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (2):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{130 \\div 2}{138 \\div 2} = \\frac{65}{69}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Check for Further Simplification:**\n\n   - **65:**\n     - Prime factors: \\( 5 \\times 13 \\).\n\n   - **69:**\n     - Prime factors: \\( 3 \\times 23 \\).\n\n   - No common factors other than 1.\n\n**Final Simplified Fraction:**\n\nThe fraction \\( \\frac{1690}{1794} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{65}{69} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{65}{69}\\)>>>"
