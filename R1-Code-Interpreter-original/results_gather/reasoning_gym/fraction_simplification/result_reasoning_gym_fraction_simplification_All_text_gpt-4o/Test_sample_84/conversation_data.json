    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{29414}{32417}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers:**\n   - Numerator: 29414\n   - Denominator: 32417\n\n2. **Find the GCD:**\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 29414 and 32417.\n   - The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders.\n\n3. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - Divide 32417 by 29414 and find the remainder.\n   - \\(32417 \\div 29414 = 1\\) remainder \\(32417 - 29414 = 3003\\).\n   - Now, divide 29414 by 3003.\n   - \\(29414 \\div 3003 = 9\\) remainder \\(29414 - 9 \\times 3003 = 293\\).\n   - Next, divide 3003 by 293.\n   - \\(3003 \\div 293 = 10\\) remainder \\(3003 - 10 \\times 293 = 83\\).\n   - Divide 293 by 83.\n   - \\(293 \\div 83 = 3\\) remainder \\(293 - 3 \\times 83 = 44\\).\n   - Divide 83 by 44.\n   - \\(83 \\div 44 = 1\\) remainder \\(83 - 44 = 39\\).\n   - Divide 44 by 39.\n   - \\(44 \\div 39 = 1\\) remainder \\(44 - 39 = 5\\).\n   - Divide 39 by 5.\n   - \\(39 \\div 5 = 7\\) remainder \\(39 - 7 \\times 5 = 4\\).\n   - Divide 5 by 4.\n   - \\(5 \\div 4 = 1\\) remainder \\(5 - 4 = 1\\).\n   - Divide 4 by 1.\n   - \\(4 \\div 1 = 4\\) remainder \\(0\\).\n\n4. **Determine the GCD:**\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 1, so the GCD of 29414 and 32417 is 1.\n\n5. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{29414}{32417}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{29414}{32417}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{29414}{32417}>>>"
