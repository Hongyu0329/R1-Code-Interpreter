    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3375}{8400}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime factorization of 3375:**\n   - 3375 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5).\n   - \\(3375 \\div 5 = 675\\)\n   - 675 is divisible by 5.\n   - \\(675 \\div 5 = 135\\)\n   - 135 is divisible by 5.\n   - \\(135 \\div 5 = 27\\)\n   - 27 is divisible by 3.\n   - \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\)\n   - 9 is divisible by 3.\n   - \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\)\n   - 3 is divisible by 3.\n   - \\(3 \\div 3 = 1\\)\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 3375 is \\(5^3 \\times 3^3\\).\n\n2. **Prime factorization of 8400:**\n   - 8400 is divisible by 2 (since it ends in 0).\n   - \\(8400 \\div 2 = 4200\\)\n   - 4200 is divisible by 2.\n   - \\(4200 \\div 2 = 2100\\)\n   - 2100 is divisible by 2.\n   - \\(2100 \\div 2 = 1050\\)\n   - 1050 is divisible by 2.\n   - \\(1050 \\div 2 = 525\\)\n   - 525 is divisible by 3.\n   - \\(525 \\div 3 = 175\\)\n   - 175 is divisible by 5.\n   - \\(175 \\div 5 = 35\\)\n   - 35 is divisible by 5.\n   - \\(35 \\div 5 = 7\\)\n   - 7 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 8400 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\nThe GCD is found by taking the lowest power of all common prime factors.\n\n- Common prime factors: 3 and 5.\n- For 3: The lowest power is \\(3^1\\).\n- For 5: The lowest power is \\(5^2\\).\n\nThus, the GCD is \\(3^1 \\times 5^2 = 3 \\times 25 = 75\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (75):\n\n- Numerator: \\(3375 \\div 75 = 45\\)\n- Denominator: \\(8400 \\div 75 = 112\\)\n\nTherefore, the fraction \\(\\frac{3375}{8400}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{45}{112}\\).\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{45}{112}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{45}{112}>>>"
