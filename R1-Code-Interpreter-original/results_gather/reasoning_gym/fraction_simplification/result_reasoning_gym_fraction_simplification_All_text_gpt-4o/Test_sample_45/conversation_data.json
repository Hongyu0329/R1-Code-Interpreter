    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{1554}{4914} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 1554 and 4914.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the numerator, 1554:\n     - 1554 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 1554 \\div 2 = 777 \\).\n     - 777 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits \\( 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \\), which is divisible by 3): \\( 777 \\div 3 = 259 \\).\n     - 259 is divisible by 7 (use divisibility rule or trial division): \\( 259 \\div 7 = 37 \\).\n     - 37 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 1554 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 37 \\).\n\n   - Now, for the denominator, 4914:\n     - 4914 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 4914 \\div 2 = 2457 \\).\n     - 2457 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits \\( 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 18 \\), which is divisible by 3): \\( 2457 \\div 3 = 819 \\).\n     - 819 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits \\( 8 + 1 + 9 = 18 \\), which is divisible by 3): \\( 819 \\div 3 = 273 \\).\n     - 273 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits \\( 2 + 7 + 3 = 12 \\), which is divisible by 3): \\( 273 \\div 3 = 91 \\).\n     - 91 is divisible by 7 (use divisibility rule or trial division): \\( 91 \\div 7 = 13 \\).\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 4914 is \\( 2 \\times 3^3 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors between 1554 and 4914 are 2, 3, and 7.\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors:\n   - \\( \\text{GCD} = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 = 42 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - Simplified numerator: \\( 1554 \\div 42 = 37 \\).\n   - Simplified denominator: \\( 4914 \\div 42 = 117 \\).\n\n2. **Check for Further Simplification:**\n   - The fraction \\( \\frac{37}{117} \\) is in its simplest form because 37 is a prime number and does not divide 117.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<37/117>>>"
