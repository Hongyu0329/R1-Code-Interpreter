    "To simplify the fraction 26560/41680 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\nStep 1: Identify the numerator and the denominator.\n- Numerator: 26560\n- Denominator: 41680\n\nStep 2: Find the GCD of 26560 and 41680.\n- To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeated division.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n- Divide 41680 by 26560 and find the remainder.\n  - 41680 ÷ 26560 = 1 remainder 15120\n- Now, divide 26560 by 15120 and find the remainder.\n  - 26560 ÷ 15120 = 1 remainder 11440\n- Next, divide 15120 by 11440 and find the remainder.\n  - 15120 ÷ 11440 = 1 remainder 3680\n- Then, divide 11440 by 3680 and find the remainder.\n  - 11440 ÷ 3680 = 3 remainder 400\n- Finally, divide 3680 by 400 and find the remainder.\n  - 3680 ÷ 400 = 9 remainder 80\n- Divide 400 by 80 and find the remainder.\n  - 400 ÷ 80 = 5 remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. Therefore, the GCD of 26560 and 41680 is 80.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n- Simplified numerator: 26560 ÷ 80 = 332\n- Simplified denominator: 41680 ÷ 80 = 521\n\nStep 5: Write the simplified fraction.\n- The fraction 26560/41680 simplifies to 332/521.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<332/521>>>"
