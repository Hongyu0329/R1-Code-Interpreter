    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{180}{1011}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 180 and 1011.**\n\n1. **Prime factorization of 180:**\n   - 180 is even, so divide by 2: \\(180 \\div 2 = 90\\).\n   - 90 is even, so divide by 2: \\(90 \\div 2 = 45\\).\n   - 45 is divisible by 3: \\(45 \\div 3 = 15\\).\n   - 15 is divisible by 3: \\(15 \\div 3 = 5\\).\n   - 5 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 180 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n2. **Prime factorization of 1011:**\n   - 1011 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits of 1011 is \\(1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3\\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3: \\(1011 \\div 3 = 337\\).\n   - Check if 337 is a prime number:\n     - 337 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19 (as none of these divisions result in an integer).\n     - Therefore, 337 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 1011 is \\(3 \\times 337\\).\n\n3. **Common factors:**\n   - The only common prime factor between 180 and 1011 is 3.\n\n4. **GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 180 and 1011 is 3.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.**\n\n- Divide the numerator by the GCD: \\(180 \\div 3 = 60\\).\n- Divide the denominator by the GCD: \\(1011 \\div 3 = 337\\).\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{60}{337}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{60}{337}\\)>>>"
