    "To simplify the fraction 21271/33820 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Identify the Numerator and Denominator:**\n   - Numerator: 21271\n   - Denominator: 33820\n\n2. **Find the GCD of 21271 and 33820:**\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n   - Start with the larger number (33820) and divide it by the smaller number (21271).\n   - Calculate the remainder: 33820 ÷ 21271 = 1 remainder 12549.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process: 21271 ÷ 12549 = 1 remainder 8722.\n   - Continue: 12549 ÷ 8722 = 1 remainder 3827.\n   - Continue: 8722 ÷ 3827 = 2 remainder 1068.\n   - Continue: 3827 ÷ 1068 = 3 remainder 623.\n   - Continue: 1068 ÷ 623 = 1 remainder 445.\n   - Continue: 623 ÷ 445 = 1 remainder 178.\n   - Continue: 445 ÷ 178 = 2 remainder 89.\n   - Continue: 178 ÷ 89 = 2 remainder 0.\n   - When the remainder is 0, the divisor at this step (89) is the GCD.\n\n3. **Divide Both Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - Divide 21271 by 89: 21271 ÷ 89 = 239.\n   - Divide 33820 by 89: 33820 ÷ 89 = 380.\n\n4. **Write the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The simplified fraction is 239/380.\n\nTherefore, the fraction 21271/33820 simplified to its lowest terms is:\n\n<<<239/380>>>"
