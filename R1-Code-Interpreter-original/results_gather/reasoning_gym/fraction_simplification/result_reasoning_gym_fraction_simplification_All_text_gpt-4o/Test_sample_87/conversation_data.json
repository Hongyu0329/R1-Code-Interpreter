    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{7032}{22776}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 7032 and 22776.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the numerator, 7032:\n     - 7032 is even, so divide by 2: \\(7032 \\div 2 = 3516\\)\n     - 3516 is even, so divide by 2: \\(3516 \\div 2 = 1758\\)\n     - 1758 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1758 \\div 2 = 879\\)\n     - 879 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits \\(8 + 7 + 9 = 24\\), which is divisible by 3):\n       - \\(879 \\div 3 = 293\\)\n     - 293 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 7032 is \\(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 293\\).\n\n   - Now for the denominator, 22776:\n     - 22776 is even, so divide by 2: \\(22776 \\div 2 = 11388\\)\n     - 11388 is even, so divide by 2: \\(11388 \\div 2 = 5694\\)\n     - 5694 is even, so divide by 2: \\(5694 \\div 2 = 2847\\)\n     - 2847 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits \\(2 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 21\\), which is divisible by 3):\n       - \\(2847 \\div 3 = 949\\)\n     - 949 is not divisible by 3, check divisibility by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5), check divisibility by 7:\n       - \\(949 \\div 7 = 135.571\\) (not divisible)\n     - Check divisibility by 11 (alternating sum of digits \\(9 - 4 + 9 = 14\\), not divisible by 11), check divisibility by 13:\n       - \\(949 \\div 13 = 73\\)\n     - 73 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 22776 is \\(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 13 \\times 73\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - Both 7032 and 22776 have the common factors \\(2^3\\) and 3.\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors:\n   - \\(GCD = 2^3 \\times 3 = 8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - \\(\\frac{7032}{24} = 293\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{22776}{24} = 949\\)\n\n2. **Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{7032}{22776}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{293}{949}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{293}{949}\\).\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{293}{949}\\)>>>"
