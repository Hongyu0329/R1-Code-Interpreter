    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{13932}{47385} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 13932 and 47385.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start by finding the prime factors of each number.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 13932:**\n   - Check divisibility by 2: 13932 is even, so divide by 2.\n     \\[\n     13932 \\div 2 = 6966\n     \\]\n   - 6966 is even, divide by 2 again.\n     \\[\n     6966 \\div 2 = 3483\n     \\]\n   - 3483 is not even, check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits is 18, divisible by 3).\n     \\[\n     3483 \\div 3 = 1161\n     \\]\n   - 1161 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 9).\n     \\[\n     1161 \\div 3 = 387\n     \\]\n   - 387 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18).\n     \\[\n     387 \\div 3 = 129\n     \\]\n   - 129 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 12).\n     \\[\n     129 \\div 3 = 43\n     \\]\n   - 43 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 13932 is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^4 \\times 43 \\).\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 47385:**\n   - Check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits is 27, divisible by 3).\n     \\[\n     47385 \\div 3 = 15795\n     \\]\n   - 15795 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 27).\n     \\[\n     15795 \\div 3 = 5265\n     \\]\n   - 5265 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18).\n     \\[\n     5265 \\div 3 = 1755\n     \\]\n   - 1755 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18).\n     \\[\n     1755 \\div 3 = 585\n     \\]\n   - 585 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 18).\n     \\[\n     585 \\div 3 = 195\n     \\]\n   - 195 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 15).\n     \\[\n     195 \\div 3 = 65\n     \\]\n   - 65 is divisible by 5.\n     \\[\n     65 \\div 5 = 13\n     \\]\n   - 13 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 47385 is \\( 3^6 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\).\n\n4. **Find the GCD:**\n   - The common prime factors are \\( 3^4 \\).\n   - Therefore, the GCD is \\( 3^4 = 81 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction.**\n\n1. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (81):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13932}{81} = 172\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{47385}{81} = 585\n   \\]\n\n2. Check if \\( \\frac{172}{585} \\) can be simplified further:\n   - 172 is \\( 2^2 \\times 43 \\).\n   - 585 is \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\).\n   - No common factors other than 1.\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{172}{585} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<172/585>>>"
