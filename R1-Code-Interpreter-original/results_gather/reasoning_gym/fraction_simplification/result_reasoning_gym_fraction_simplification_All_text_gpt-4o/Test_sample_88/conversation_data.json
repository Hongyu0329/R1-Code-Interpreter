    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3175}{6600}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 3175 and 6600.**\n\n1. **Prime factorization of 3175:**\n   - 3175 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits of 3175 is \\(3 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16\\), which is not divisible by 3.\n   - The last digit is 5, so 3175 is divisible by 5.\n   - Dividing 3175 by 5: \\(3175 \\div 5 = 635\\).\n   - 635 is also divisible by 5 (last digit is 5).\n   - Dividing 635 by 5: \\(635 \\div 5 = 127\\).\n   - 127 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 3175 is \\(5^2 \\times 127\\).\n\n2. **Prime factorization of 6600:**\n   - 6600 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Dividing 6600 by 2: \\(6600 \\div 2 = 3300\\).\n   - 3300 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Dividing 3300 by 2: \\(3300 \\div 2 = 1650\\).\n   - 1650 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Dividing 1650 by 2: \\(1650 \\div 2 = 825\\).\n   - Sum of digits of 825 is \\(8 + 2 + 5 = 15\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Dividing 825 by 3: \\(825 \\div 3 = 275\\).\n   - 275 is divisible by 5 (last digit is 5).\n   - Dividing 275 by 5: \\(275 \\div 5 = 55\\).\n   - 55 is divisible by 5 (last digit is 5).\n   - Dividing 55 by 5: \\(55 \\div 5 = 11\\).\n   - 11 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6600 is \\(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 11\\).\n\n3. **Find the common factors:**\n   - The common prime factors of 3175 and 6600 are \\(5^2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.**\n\n- Divide the numerator by the GCD: \\(3175 \\div 25 = 127\\).\n- Divide the denominator by the GCD: \\(6600 \\div 25 = 264\\).\n\nThus, the fraction \\(\\frac{3175}{6600}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{127}{264}\\).\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{127}{264}\\).\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{127}{264}\\)>>>"
