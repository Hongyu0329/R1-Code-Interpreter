    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{4588}{43438}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the GCD of 4588 and 43438.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - Find the prime factorization of 4588.\n   - Find the prime factorization of 43438.\n   - Identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n   - Apply the algorithm: \n     - Divide 43438 by 4588 and find the remainder.\n     - Replace 43438 with 4588 and 4588 with the remainder.\n     - Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n     - The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.**\n\n1. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n2. Write the simplified fraction.\n\n**Detailed Calculation:**\n\n1. **Using the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - \\(43438 \\div 4588 = 9\\) remainder \\(43438 - 9 \\times 4588 = 43438 - 41292 = 2146\\).\n   - \\(4588 \\div 2146 = 2\\) remainder \\(4588 - 2 \\times 2146 = 4588 - 4292 = 296\\).\n   - \\(2146 \\div 296 = 7\\) remainder \\(2146 - 7 \\times 296 = 2146 - 2072 = 74\\).\n   - \\(296 \\div 74 = 4\\) remainder \\(296 - 4 \\times 74 = 296 - 296 = 0\\).\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 74, so the GCD of 4588 and 43438 is 74.\n\n2. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 74:\n     - \\( \\frac{4588}{74} = 62 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{43438}{74} = 587 \\)\n\n   Therefore, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{62}{587}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{62}{587}\\)>>>"
