    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{8990}{9951}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 8990 and 9951.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the numerator, 8990:\n     - 8990 is even, so divide by 2: \\(8990 \\div 2 = 4495\\).\n     - 4495 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(4495 \\div 5 = 899\\).\n     - 899 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 7:\n       - \\(899 \\div 7 \\approx 128.43\\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 11:\n       - Sum of digits of 899 is 26, which is not divisible by 11.\n     - Check divisibility by 13:\n       - \\(899 \\div 13 = 69\\).\n     - 69 is divisible by 3: \\(69 \\div 3 = 23\\).\n     - 23 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 8990 is \\(2 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\times 3 \\times 23\\).\n\n   - Now, for the denominator, 9951:\n     - 9951 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Check divisibility by 7:\n       - \\(9951 \\div 7 \\approx 1421.57\\) (not divisible).\n     - Check divisibility by 11:\n       - Sum of digits of 9951 is 24, which is not divisible by 11.\n     - Check divisibility by 13:\n       - \\(9951 \\div 13 = 765\\).\n     - 765 is divisible by 3: \\(765 \\div 3 = 255\\).\n     - 255 is divisible by 3: \\(255 \\div 3 = 85\\).\n     - 85 is divisible by 5: \\(85 \\div 5 = 17\\).\n     - 17 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 9951 is \\(13 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 17\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - 8990: \\(2 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\times 3 \\times 23\\)\n     - 9951: \\(13 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 17\\)\n   - Common factors are \\(13\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - GCD is the product of all common prime factors: \\(13 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 195\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - \\(\\frac{8990}{195} = 46\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{9951}{195} = 51\\)\n\n2. **Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{46}{51}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{8990}{9951}\\) simplified to its lowest terms is \\(\\frac{46}{51}\\).\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{46}{51}\\)>>>"
