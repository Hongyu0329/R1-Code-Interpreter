    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{200}{250} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - First, we need to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator (200) and the denominator (250).\n   - To do this, we can list the factors of each number:\n     - Factors of 200: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200\n     - Factors of 250: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 125, 250\n   - The common factors are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\n   - The greatest of these common factors is 50.\n\n2. **Divide the Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (50):\n     - \\( \\frac{200}{50} = 4 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\)\n\n3. **Write the Simplified Fraction:**\n   - After dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 50, the fraction simplifies to \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\).\n\n4. **Verify the Simplification:**\n   - Check that 4 and 5 have no common factors other than 1, confirming that \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) is indeed in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<4/5>>>"
