    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{1978}{13915} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 1978 and 13915.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the smaller number, 1978.\n   - Check divisibility by small prime numbers:\n     - 1978 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 1978 \\div 2 = 989 \\).\n     - 989 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).\n     - Check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\( 9 + 8 + 9 = 26 \\), not divisible by 3.\n     - Check divisibility by 5: last digit is not 0 or 5.\n     - Check divisibility by 7: \\( 989 \\div 7 \\approx 141.2857 \\), not divisible.\n     - Check divisibility by 11: alternating sum \\( 9 - 8 + 9 = 10 \\), not divisible.\n     - Check divisibility by 13: \\( 989 \\div 13 = 76.0769 \\), not divisible.\n     - Check divisibility by 17: \\( 989 \\div 17 = 58.1765 \\), not divisible.\n     - Check divisibility by 19: \\( 989 \\div 19 = 52.0526 \\), not divisible.\n     - Check divisibility by 23: \\( 989 \\div 23 = 43 \\), divisible.\n     - So, \\( 989 = 23 \\times 43 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 1978 = 2 \\times 23 \\times 43 \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 13915:**\n   - Check divisibility by small prime numbers:\n     - 13915 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n     - Check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\( 1 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 5 = 19 \\), not divisible by 3.\n     - Check divisibility by 5: last digit is 5, divisible by 5.\n     - \\( 13915 \\div 5 = 2783 \\).\n     - Check divisibility of 2783 by small primes:\n       - 2783 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n       - Check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\( 2 + 7 + 8 + 3 = 20 \\), not divisible by 3.\n       - Check divisibility by 7: \\( 2783 \\div 7 \\approx 397.5714 \\), not divisible.\n       - Check divisibility by 11: alternating sum \\( 2 - 7 + 8 - 3 = 0 \\), divisible.\n       - \\( 2783 \\div 11 = 253 \\).\n     - Check divisibility of 253 by small primes:\n       - 253 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n       - Check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \\( 2 + 5 + 3 = 10 \\), not divisible by 3.\n       - Check divisibility by 5: last digit is not 0 or 5.\n       - Check divisibility by 7: \\( 253 \\div 7 = 36.1429 \\), not divisible.\n       - Check divisibility by 11: alternating sum \\( 2 - 5 + 3 = 0 \\), divisible.\n       - \\( 253 \\div 11 = 23 \\).\n     - Therefore, \\( 13915 = 5 \\times 11 \\times 11 \\times 23 \\).\n\n3. **Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factor is 23.\n\n4. **GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 1978 and 13915 is 23.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (23):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1978}{13915} = \\frac{1978 \\div 23}{13915 \\div 23} = \\frac{86}{605}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Check if Further Simplification is Possible.**\n\n- Factor 86: \\( 86 = 2 \\times 43 \\).\n- Factor 605: \\( 605 = 5 \\times 11 \\times 11 \\).\n- No common factors between 86 and 605.\n\nThus, the fraction \\( \\frac{86}{605} \\) is in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<86/605>>>"
