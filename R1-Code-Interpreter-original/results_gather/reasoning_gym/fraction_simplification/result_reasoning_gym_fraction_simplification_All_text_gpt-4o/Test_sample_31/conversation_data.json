    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{17290}{17328}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 17290 and 17328.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - First, we can try to factorize both numbers to find common factors.\n   - However, since these numbers are large, it might be more efficient to use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division to find the GCD.\n   - Start with the two numbers: 17290 and 17328.\n\n   - Calculate \\(17328 \\mod 17290\\):\n     \\[\n     17328 - 17290 = 38\n     \\]\n     So, \\(17328 \\equiv 38 \\pmod{17290}\\).\n\n   - Now, calculate \\(17290 \\mod 38\\):\n     - Divide 17290 by 38:\n     \\[\n     17290 \\div 38 = 455 \\quad \\text{(quotient)}, \\quad \\text{remainder} = 0\n     \\]\n     So, \\(17290 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{38}\\).\n\n   - Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 38.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (38):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{17290}{38} = 455\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{17328}{38} = 456\n  \\]\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{455}{456}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{455}{456}\\)>>>"
