    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{30646}{73689} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 30646 and 73689.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - We can attempt to factor both numbers into their prime factors, but this can be cumbersome for large numbers.\n   \n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is a more efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers. It involves repeated division and taking remainders.\n\n   - Apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n     - Divide 73689 by 30646 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 73689 \\div 30646 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 12497 \\).\n     - Now, divide 30646 by 12497.\n     - \\( 30646 \\div 12497 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 5652 \\).\n     - Now, divide 12497 by 5652.\n     - \\( 12497 \\div 5652 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 1193 \\).\n     - Now, divide 5652 by 1193.\n     - \\( 5652 \\div 1193 = 4 \\) remainder \\( 880 \\).\n     - Now, divide 1193 by 880.\n     - \\( 1193 \\div 880 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 313 \\).\n     - Now, divide 880 by 313.\n     - \\( 880 \\div 313 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 254 \\).\n     - Now, divide 313 by 254.\n     - \\( 313 \\div 254 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 59 \\).\n     - Now, divide 254 by 59.\n     - \\( 254 \\div 59 = 4 \\) remainder \\( 18 \\).\n     - Now, divide 59 by 18.\n     - \\( 59 \\div 18 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 5 \\).\n     - Now, divide 18 by 5.\n     - \\( 18 \\div 5 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 3 \\).\n     - Now, divide 5 by 3.\n     - \\( 5 \\div 3 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 2 \\).\n     - Now, divide 3 by 2.\n     - \\( 3 \\div 2 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\).\n     - Now, divide 2 by 1.\n     - \\( 2 \\div 1 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\).\n\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 30646 and 73689 is 1.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction.**\n\n- Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \\( \\frac{30646}{73689} \\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{30646}{73689} \\).\n\n<<<30646/73689>>>"
