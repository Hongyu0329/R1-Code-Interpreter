    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{18975}{47625}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 18975:**\n   - 18975 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits of 18975 is \\(1 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 5 = 30\\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:\n     \\[\n     18975 \\div 3 = 6325\n     \\]\n   - 6325 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 16).\n   - 6325 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5:\n     \\[\n     6325 \\div 5 = 1265\n     \\]\n   - 1265 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5:\n     \\[\n     1265 \\div 5 = 253\n     \\]\n   - 253 is not divisible by 3 or 5. Check divisibility by 7:\n     \\[\n     253 \\div 7 = 36.14 \\quad (\\text{not divisible})\n     \\]\n   - Check divisibility by 11:\n     - Alternating sum of digits: \\(2 - 5 + 3 = 0\\), divisible by 11.\n     \\[\n     253 \\div 11 = 23\n     \\]\n   - 23 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 18975 is \\(3 \\times 5^2 \\times 11 \\times 23\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 47625:**\n   - 47625 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits of 47625 is \\(4 + 7 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 24\\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:\n     \\[\n     47625 \\div 3 = 15875\n     \\]\n   - 15875 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 26).\n   - 15875 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5:\n     \\[\n     15875 \\div 5 = 3175\n     \\]\n   - 3175 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5:\n     \\[\n     3175 \\div 5 = 635\n     \\]\n   - 635 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5:\n     \\[\n     635 \\div 5 = 127\n     \\]\n   - 127 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 47625 is \\(3 \\times 5^3 \\times 127\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- Common prime factors: \\(3\\) and \\(5^2\\).\n- GCD is \\(3 \\times 5^2 = 75\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (75):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{18975}{47625} = \\frac{18975 \\div 75}{47625 \\div 75} = \\frac{253}{635}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Further Simplification**\n\n- Check if \\(\\frac{253}{635}\\) can be simplified further:\n  - Prime factorization of 253: \\(11 \\times 23\\).\n  - Prime factorization of 635: \\(5 \\times 127\\).\n  - No common factors.\n\nThus, the fraction \\(\\frac{253}{635}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{253}{635}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{253}{635}>>>"
