    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{25872}{33544}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 25872 and 33544.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start by finding the prime factorization of each number.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 25872:**\n   - Check divisibility by 2 (since 25872 is even):\n     \\[\n     25872 \\div 2 = 12936\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     12936 \\div 2 = 6468\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     6468 \\div 2 = 3234\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3234 \\div 2 = 1617\n     \\]\n   - 1617 is not divisible by 2. Check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits is 15, which is divisible by 3):\n     \\[\n     1617 \\div 3 = 539\n     \\]\n   - 539 is not divisible by 3. Check divisibility by 11 (alternating sum of digits is 0, which is divisible by 11):\n     \\[\n     539 \\div 11 = 49\n     \\]\n   - 49 is \\(7 \\times 7\\).\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 25872 is \\(2^4 \\times 3 \\times 11 \\times 7^2\\).\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 33544:**\n   - Check divisibility by 2 (since 33544 is even):\n     \\[\n     33544 \\div 2 = 16772\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     16772 \\div 2 = 8386\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     8386 \\div 2 = 4193\n     \\]\n   - 4193 is not divisible by 2. Check divisibility by 3 (sum of digits is 17, not divisible by 3).\n   - Check divisibility by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5).\n   - Check divisibility by 7 (use division):\n     \\[\n     4193 \\div 7 = 599\n     \\]\n   - 599 is not divisible by 7. Check divisibility by 11 (alternating sum of digits is 0, divisible by 11):\n     \\[\n     599 \\div 11 = 59\n     \\]\n   - 59 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 33544 is \\(2^3 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 59\\).\n\n4. **Find the GCD:**\n   - The common prime factors are \\(2^3\\), \\(7\\), and \\(11\\).\n   - Therefore, the GCD is \\(2^3 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 616\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction.**\n\n1. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (616):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{25872}{616} = 42\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{33544}{616} = 54\n   \\]\n\n2. The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{42}{54}\\).\n\n3. Simplify \\(\\frac{42}{54}\\) further by finding the GCD of 42 and 54:\n   - Prime factorization of 42: \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n   - Prime factorization of 54: \\(2 \\times 3^3\\).\n   - Common factors: \\(2 \\times 3\\).\n   - GCD is \\(6\\).\n\n4. Divide both by 6:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42}{6} = 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{54}{6} = 9\n   \\]\n\n5. The fraction \\(\\frac{7}{9}\\) is in its lowest terms.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{7}{9}\\)>>>"
