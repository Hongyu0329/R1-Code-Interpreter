    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{15260}{18655}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 15260 and 18655.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start by finding the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 15260:\n     - 15260 is even, so divide by 2: \\(15260 \\div 2 = 7630\\).\n     - 7630 is even, so divide by 2: \\(7630 \\div 2 = 3815\\).\n     - 3815 is divisible by 5 (last digit is 5): \\(3815 \\div 5 = 763\\).\n     - 763 is divisible by 7 (sum of digits is 16, which is divisible by 7): \\(763 \\div 7 = 109\\).\n     - 109 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 15260 is \\(2^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 109\\).\n\n   - For 18655:\n     - 18655 is divisible by 5 (last digit is 5): \\(18655 \\div 5 = 3731\\).\n     - 3731 is divisible by 7 (sum of digits is 14, which is divisible by 7): \\(3731 \\div 7 = 533\\).\n     - 533 is divisible by 13 (sum of digits is 11, which is divisible by 13): \\(533 \\div 13 = 41\\).\n     - 41 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 18655 is \\(5 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\times 41\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors of 15260 and 18655 are 5 and 7.\n\n3. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors.\n   - GCD = \\(5^1 \\times 7^1 = 35\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. **Divide Both Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**\n   - \\(\\frac{15260}{35} = 436\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{18655}{35} = 533\\).\n\n2. **Simplified Fraction:**\n   - The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{436}{533}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{15260}{18655}\\) simplified to its lowest terms is \\(\\frac{436}{533}\\).\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{436}{533}\\)>>>"
