    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{648}{3300}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime factorization of 648:**\n   - 648 is even, divide by 2: \\(648 \\div 2 = 324\\)\n   - 324 is even, divide by 2: \\(324 \\div 2 = 162\\)\n   - 162 is even, divide by 2: \\(162 \\div 2 = 81\\)\n   - 81 is divisible by 3: \\(81 \\div 3 = 27\\)\n   - 27 is divisible by 3: \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\)\n   - 9 is divisible by 3: \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\)\n   - 3 is divisible by 3: \\(3 \\div 3 = 1\\)\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 648 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^4\\).\n\n2. **Prime factorization of 3300:**\n   - 3300 is even, divide by 2: \\(3300 \\div 2 = 1650\\)\n   - 1650 is even, divide by 2: \\(1650 \\div 2 = 825\\)\n   - 825 is divisible by 3: \\(825 \\div 3 = 275\\)\n   - 275 is divisible by 5: \\(275 \\div 5 = 55\\)\n   - 55 is divisible by 5: \\(55 \\div 5 = 11\\)\n   - 11 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 3300 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 11^1\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\nThe GCD is found by taking the lowest power of all common prime factors.\n\n- Common prime factors: 2 and 3.\n- Lowest power of 2: \\(2^2\\)\n- Lowest power of 3: \\(3^1\\)\n\nThus, the GCD is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (12):\n\n- Numerator: \\(648 \\div 12 = 54\\)\n- Denominator: \\(3300 \\div 12 = 275\\)\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{54}{275}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{648}{3300}\\) simplified to its lowest terms is \\(\\frac{54}{275}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{54}{275}>>>"
