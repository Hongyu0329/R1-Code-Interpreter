    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3725}{5425}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 3725 and 5425.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with 3725:\n     - 3725 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n     - Sum of digits of 3725 is \\(3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17\\), which is not divisible by 3.\n     - The last digit is 5, so 3725 is divisible by 5.\n     - \\(3725 \\div 5 = 745\\).\n     - 745 is also divisible by 5 (last digit is 5).\n     - \\(745 \\div 5 = 149\\).\n     - 149 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 3725 is \\(5^2 \\times 149\\).\n\n   - Now for 5425:\n     - 5425 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n     - Sum of digits of 5425 is \\(5 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 16\\), which is not divisible by 3.\n     - The last digit is 5, so 5425 is divisible by 5.\n     - \\(5425 \\div 5 = 1085\\).\n     - 1085 is also divisible by 5 (last digit is 5).\n     - \\(1085 \\div 5 = 217\\).\n     - 217 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n     - Check divisibility by 7: \\(217 \\div 7 = 31\\).\n     - 31 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 5425 is \\(5^2 \\times 31\\).\n\n2. **Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors of 3725 and 5425 are \\(5^2\\).\n\n3. **GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 3725 and 5425 is \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (25):\n  - \\(\\frac{3725}{25} = 149\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{5425}{25} = 217\\)\n\nThus, the fraction \\(\\frac{3725}{5425}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{149}{217}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{149}{217}\\)>>>"
