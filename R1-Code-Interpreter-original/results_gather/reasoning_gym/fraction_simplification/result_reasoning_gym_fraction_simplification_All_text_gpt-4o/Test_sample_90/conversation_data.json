    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{16863}{40271}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 16863 and 40271.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - This method involves finding the prime factors of both numbers and then identifying the common factors.\n   - However, for large numbers, this method can be cumbersome, so we often use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers.\n   - It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\n   Apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n   - Compute \\(40271 \\mod 16863\\).\n   - \\(40271 \\div 16863\\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of \\(40271 - 2 \\times 16863 = 6545\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(16863 \\mod 6545\\).\n   - \\(16863 \\div 6545\\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of \\(16863 - 2 \\times 6545 = 3773\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(6545 \\mod 3773\\).\n   - \\(6545 \\div 3773\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(6545 - 1 \\times 3773 = 2772\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(3773 \\mod 2772\\).\n   - \\(3773 \\div 2772\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(3773 - 1 \\times 2772 = 1001\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(2772 \\mod 1001\\).\n   - \\(2772 \\div 1001\\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of \\(2772 - 2 \\times 1001 = 770\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(1001 \\mod 770\\).\n   - \\(1001 \\div 770\\) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of \\(1001 - 1 \\times 770 = 231\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(770 \\mod 231\\).\n   - \\(770 \\div 231\\) gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of \\(770 - 3 \\times 231 = 77\\).\n   - Now, compute \\(231 \\mod 77\\).\n   - \\(231 \\div 77\\) gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of \\(231 - 3 \\times 77 = 0\\).\n\n   The remainder is now 0, and the last non-zero remainder is 77. Therefore, the GCD of 16863 and 40271 is 77.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, 77:\n  - \\(\\frac{16863}{77} = 219\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{40271}{77} = 523\\)\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{219}{523}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{219}{523}\\)>>>"
