    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{31536}{38617}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 31536 and 38617.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - This method involves finding the prime factors of both numbers and then identifying the common factors.\n   - However, for large numbers, this method can be cumbersome without computational tools.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is a more efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers.\n   - It involves repeated division and taking remainders until a remainder of 0 is reached.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Euclidean Algorithm.**\n\n1. Divide 38617 by 31536 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   38617 \\div 31536 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 38617 - 31536 = 7071\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide 31536 by 7071 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   31536 \\div 7071 = 4 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 31536 - 4 \\times 7071 = 2252\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide 7071 by 2252 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   7071 \\div 2252 = 3 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 7071 - 3 \\times 2252 = 315\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide 2252 by 315 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   2252 \\div 315 = 7 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 2252 - 7 \\times 315 = 47\n   \\]\n\n5. Divide 315 by 47 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   315 \\div 47 = 6 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 315 - 6 \\times 47 = 33\n   \\]\n\n6. Divide 47 by 33 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   47 \\div 33 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 47 - 33 = 14\n   \\]\n\n7. Divide 33 by 14 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   33 \\div 14 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 33 - 2 \\times 14 = 5\n   \\]\n\n8. Divide 14 by 5 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   14 \\div 5 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 14 - 2 \\times 5 = 4\n   \\]\n\n9. Divide 5 by 4 and find the remainder.\n   \\[\n   5 \\div 4 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 5 - 4 = 1\n   \\]\n\n10. Divide 4 by 1 and find the remainder.\n    \\[\n    4 \\div 1 = 4 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 0\n    \\]\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 31536 and 38617 is 1.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\nSince the GCD is 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{31536}{38617}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{31536}{38617}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{31536}{38617}>>>"
