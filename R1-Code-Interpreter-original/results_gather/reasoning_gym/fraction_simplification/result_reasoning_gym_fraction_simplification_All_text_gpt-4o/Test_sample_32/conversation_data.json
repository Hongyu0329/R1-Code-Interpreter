    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{1296}{4941}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 1296:**\n   - 1296 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1296 \\div 2 = 648\\)\n   - 648 is even, so divide by 2: \\(648 \\div 2 = 324\\)\n   - 324 is even, so divide by 2: \\(324 \\div 2 = 162\\)\n   - 162 is even, so divide by 2: \\(162 \\div 2 = 81\\)\n   - 81 is not even, but it is \\(9 \\times 9\\), and 9 is \\(3 \\times 3\\).\n   - So, \\(81 = 3^4\\).\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 1296 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^4\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 4941:**\n   - 4941 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits of 4941 is \\(4 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(4941 \\div 3 = 1647\\)\n   - Sum of digits of 1647 is \\(1 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(1647 \\div 3 = 549\\)\n   - Sum of digits of 549 is \\(5 + 4 + 9 = 18\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(549 \\div 3 = 183\\)\n   - Sum of digits of 183 is \\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - Divide by 3: \\(183 \\div 3 = 61\\)\n   - 61 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 4941 is \\(3^4 \\times 61\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The common prime factors are \\(3^4\\).\n- Therefore, the GCD of 1296 and 4941 is \\(3^4 = 81\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (81):\n  - \\(\\frac{1296}{81} = 16\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{4941}{81} = 61\\)\n\nThus, the fraction \\(\\frac{1296}{4941}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{16}{61}\\).\n\nThe simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<16/61>>>"
