    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{192}{216}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime factorization of 192:**\n   - 192 is even, divide by 2: \\(192 \\div 2 = 96\\)\n   - 96 is even, divide by 2: \\(96 \\div 2 = 48\\)\n   - 48 is even, divide by 2: \\(48 \\div 2 = 24\\)\n   - 24 is even, divide by 2: \\(24 \\div 2 = 12\\)\n   - 12 is even, divide by 2: \\(12 \\div 2 = 6\\)\n   - 6 is even, divide by 2: \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\)\n   - 3 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 192 is \\(2^6 \\times 3^1\\).\n\n2. **Prime factorization of 216:**\n   - 216 is even, divide by 2: \\(216 \\div 2 = 108\\)\n   - 108 is even, divide by 2: \\(108 \\div 2 = 54\\)\n   - 54 is even, divide by 2: \\(54 \\div 2 = 27\\)\n   - 27 is divisible by 3: \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\)\n   - 9 is divisible by 3: \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\)\n   - 3 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 216 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^3\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\n- The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of all prime factors present in both numbers.\n- For 2, the lowest power is \\(2^3\\).\n- For 3, the lowest power is \\(3^1\\).\n\nThus, the GCD of 192 and 216 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 = 8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (24):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{192}{216} = \\frac{192 \\div 24}{216 \\div 24} = \\frac{8}{9}\n  \\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{192}{216}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{8}{9}\\).\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<8/9>>>"
