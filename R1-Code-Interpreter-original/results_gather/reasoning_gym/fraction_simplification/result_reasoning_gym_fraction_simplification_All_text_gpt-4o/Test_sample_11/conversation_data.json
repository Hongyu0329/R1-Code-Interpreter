    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{3600}{26370} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n1. **Prime factorization of 3600:**\n   - 3600 is even, divide by 2: \\( 3600 \\div 2 = 1800 \\)\n   - 1800 is even, divide by 2: \\( 1800 \\div 2 = 900 \\)\n   - 900 is even, divide by 2: \\( 900 \\div 2 = 450 \\)\n   - 450 is even, divide by 2: \\( 450 \\div 2 = 225 \\)\n   - 225 is divisible by 3: \\( 225 \\div 3 = 75 \\)\n   - 75 is divisible by 3: \\( 75 \\div 3 = 25 \\)\n   - 25 is divisible by 5: \\( 25 \\div 5 = 5 \\)\n   - 5 is divisible by 5: \\( 5 \\div 5 = 1 \\)\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 3600 is \\( 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\n2. **Prime factorization of 26370:**\n   - 26370 is even, divide by 2: \\( 26370 \\div 2 = 13185 \\)\n   - 13185 is divisible by 3: \\( 13185 \\div 3 = 4395 \\)\n   - 4395 is divisible by 3: \\( 4395 \\div 3 = 1465 \\)\n   - 1465 is divisible by 5: \\( 1465 \\div 5 = 293 \\)\n   - 293 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factorization of 26370 is \\( 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 293^1 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCD**\n\nThe GCD is found by taking the lowest power of all common prime factors:\n\n- Common prime factors: 2, 3, 5\n- Lowest powers: \\( 2^1, 3^2, 5^1 \\)\n\nThus, the GCD is \\( 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 = 2 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 90 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:\n\n- Numerator: \\( 3600 \\div 90 = 40 \\)\n- Denominator: \\( 26370 \\div 90 = 293 \\)\n\nThus, the simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{40}{293} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<40/293>>>"
