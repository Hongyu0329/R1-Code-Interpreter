    "To simplify the fraction 3680/74800 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\nStep 1: Identify the numerator and the denominator.\n- Numerator: 3680\n- Denominator: 74800\n\nStep 2: Find the GCD of 3680 and 74800.\n- We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n- Divide 74800 by 3680 and find the remainder.\n  - 74800 ÷ 3680 = 20 remainder 800\n- Now, divide 3680 by 800 and find the remainder.\n  - 3680 ÷ 800 = 4 remainder 80\n- Next, divide 800 by 80 and find the remainder.\n  - 800 ÷ 80 = 10 remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. Therefore, the GCD of 3680 and 74800 is 80.\n\nStep 4: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n- Simplified numerator: 3680 ÷ 80 = 46\n- Simplified denominator: 74800 ÷ 80 = 935\n\nStep 5: Write the simplified fraction.\n- The fraction 3680/74800 simplified to its lowest terms is 46/935.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<46/935>>>"
