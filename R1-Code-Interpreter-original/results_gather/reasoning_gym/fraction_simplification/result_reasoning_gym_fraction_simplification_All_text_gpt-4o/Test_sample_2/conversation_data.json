    "To simplify the fraction 13725/20325 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\nStep 1: Identify the numerator and the denominator.\n- Numerator: 13725\n- Denominator: 20325\n\nStep 2: Find the GCD of 13725 and 20325.\n- To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeated division.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n- Divide 20325 by 13725 and find the remainder.\n  - 20325 ÷ 13725 = 1 remainder 6600\n- Now, divide 13725 by 6600 and find the remainder.\n  - 13725 ÷ 6600 = 2 remainder 525\n- Next, divide 6600 by 525 and find the remainder.\n  - 6600 ÷ 525 = 12 remainder 300\n- Then, divide 525 by 300 and find the remainder.\n  - 525 ÷ 300 = 1 remainder 225\n- Now, divide 300 by 225 and find the remainder.\n  - 300 ÷ 225 = 1 remainder 75\n- Finally, divide 225 by 75 and find the remainder.\n  - 225 ÷ 75 = 3 remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. Therefore, the GCD of 13725 and 20325 is 75.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n- Simplified numerator: 13725 ÷ 75 = 183\n- Simplified denominator: 20325 ÷ 75 = 271\n\nStep 5: Write the simplified fraction.\n- The fraction 13725/20325 simplifies to 183/271.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<183/271>>>"
