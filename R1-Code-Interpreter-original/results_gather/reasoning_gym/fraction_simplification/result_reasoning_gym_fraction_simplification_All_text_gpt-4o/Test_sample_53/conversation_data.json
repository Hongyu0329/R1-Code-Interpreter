    "To simplify the fraction 16195/56801 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: \n   - Numerator: 16195\n   - Denominator: 56801\n\n2. **Find the GCD**:\n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 16195 and 56801.\n   - The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Divide 56801 by 16195, which gives a quotient and a remainder.\n   - 56801 ÷ 16195 = 3 remainder 8216\n   - Now, divide 16195 by 8216.\n   - 16195 ÷ 8216 = 1 remainder 7979\n   - Next, divide 8216 by 7979.\n   - 8216 ÷ 7979 = 1 remainder 237\n   - Then, divide 7979 by 237.\n   - 7979 ÷ 237 = 33 remainder 130\n   - Next, divide 237 by 130.\n   - 237 ÷ 130 = 1 remainder 107\n   - Then, divide 130 by 107.\n   - 130 ÷ 107 = 1 remainder 23\n   - Next, divide 107 by 23.\n   - 107 ÷ 23 = 4 remainder 15\n   - Then, divide 23 by 15.\n   - 23 ÷ 15 = 1 remainder 8\n   - Next, divide 15 by 8.\n   - 15 ÷ 8 = 1 remainder 7\n   - Then, divide 8 by 7.\n   - 8 ÷ 7 = 1 remainder 1\n   - Finally, divide 7 by 1.\n   - 7 ÷ 1 = 7 remainder 0\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 16195 and 56801 is 1.\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - Since the GCD is 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The fraction 16195/56801 cannot be simplified further.\n\nThe simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<16195/56801>>>"
