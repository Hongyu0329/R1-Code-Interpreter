    "To simplify the fraction 625/3150 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this number. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of the numerator (625):**\n   - 625 is a perfect square, specifically \\(25 \\times 25\\).\n   - 25 can be factored into \\(5 \\times 5\\).\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 625 is \\(5^4\\).\n\n2. **Find the prime factorization of the denominator (3150):**\n   - 3150 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2: \\(3150 \\div 2 = 1575\\).\n   - 1575 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5: \\(1575 \\div 5 = 315\\).\n   - 315 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5: \\(315 \\div 5 = 63\\).\n   - 63 is divisible by 3: \\(63 \\div 3 = 21\\).\n   - 21 is divisible by 3: \\(21 \\div 3 = 7\\).\n   - 7 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 3150 is \\(2 \\times 5^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7\\).\n\n3. **Identify the common factors:**\n   - The common prime factor between 625 and 3150 is 5.\n   - The highest power of 5 that is common to both factorizations is \\(5^2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD:**\n   - The GCD of 625 and 3150 is \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n\n5. **Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:**\n   - Numerator: \\(625 \\div 25 = 25\\).\n   - Denominator: \\(3150 \\div 25 = 126\\).\n\n6. **Verify that the fraction is in its simplest form:**\n   - The prime factorization of 25 is \\(5^2\\).\n   - The prime factorization of 126 is \\(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7\\).\n   - There are no common factors between 25 and 126, confirming that the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<25/126>>>"
