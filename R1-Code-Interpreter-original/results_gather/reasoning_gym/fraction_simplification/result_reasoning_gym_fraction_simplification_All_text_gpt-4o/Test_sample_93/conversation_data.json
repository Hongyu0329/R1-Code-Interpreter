    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{7221}{26738}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 7221 and 26738.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**\n   - First, we need to find the prime factors of both numbers.\n   - For 7221:\n     - Check divisibility by 2: 7221 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n     - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \\(7 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 12\\), which is divisible by 3. So, 7221 is divisible by 3.\n     - Divide 7221 by 3: \\(7221 \\div 3 = 2407\\).\n     - Check divisibility of 2407 by 3: Sum of digits \\(2 + 4 + 0 + 7 = 13\\), not divisible by 3.\n     - Check divisibility by 5: 2407 does not end in 0 or 5, not divisible by 5.\n     - Check divisibility by 7: \\(2407 \\div 7 = 343\\).\n     - 343 is \\(7^3\\).\n     - So, the prime factorization of 7221 is \\(3 \\times 7^3\\).\n\n   - For 26738:\n     - Check divisibility by 2: 26738 is even, divisible by 2.\n     - Divide 26738 by 2: \\(26738 \\div 2 = 13369\\).\n     - Check divisibility of 13369 by 3: Sum of digits \\(1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 22\\), not divisible by 3.\n     - Check divisibility by 5: 13369 does not end in 0 or 5, not divisible by 5.\n     - Check divisibility by 7: \\(13369 \\div 7 = 1909\\).\n     - Check divisibility of 1909 by 7: \\(1909 \\div 7 = 273\\).\n     - Check divisibility of 273 by 7: \\(273 \\div 7 = 39\\).\n     - 39 is \\(3 \\times 13\\).\n     - So, the prime factorization of 26738 is \\(2 \\times 7^3 \\times 3 \\times 13\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - The common prime factors are \\(3\\) and \\(7^3\\).\n\n3. **Calculate GCD:**\n   - The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors.\n   - GCD = \\(3 \\times 7^3 = 3 \\times 343 = 1029\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n1. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (1029):\n   - Numerator: \\(7221 \\div 1029 = 7\\).\n   - Denominator: \\(26738 \\div 1029 = 26\\).\n\n2. The simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{7}{26}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{7}{26}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{7}{26}>>>"
