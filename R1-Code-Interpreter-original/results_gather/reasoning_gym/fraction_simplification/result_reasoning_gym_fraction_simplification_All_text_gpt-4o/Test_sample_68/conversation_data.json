    "To simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{2950}{9263} \\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 2950 and 9263.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start with the prime factorization of 2950:\n     - 2950 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 2950 \\div 2 = 1475 \\).\n     - 1475 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 1475 \\div 5 = 295 \\).\n     - 295 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\( 295 \\div 5 = 59 \\).\n     - 59 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 2950 is \\( 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 59 \\).\n\n   - Now, find the prime factorization of 9263:\n     - 9263 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n     - The sum of the digits of 9263 is 20, which is not divisible by 3.\n     - 9263 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\n     - Check divisibility by 7: \\( 9263 \\div 7 \\approx 1323.2857 \\), not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 11: The alternating sum of the digits is \\( 9 - 2 + 6 - 3 = 10 \\), not divisible by 11.\n     - Check divisibility by 13: \\( 9263 \\div 13 \\approx 712.5385 \\), not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 17: \\( 9263 \\div 17 \\approx 544.8824 \\), not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 19: \\( 9263 \\div 19 = 487 \\), which is an integer.\n     - 487 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 9263 is \\( 19 \\times 487 \\).\n\n2. **Common Factors:**\n   - The prime factors of 2950 are \\( 2, 5, \\) and \\( 59 \\).\n   - The prime factors of 9263 are \\( 19 \\) and \\( 487 \\).\n   - There are no common prime factors between 2950 and 9263.\n\n3. **GCD:**\n   - Since there are no common prime factors, the GCD of 2950 and 9263 is 1.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction.**\n\n- Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \\( \\frac{2950}{9263} \\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{2950}{9263} \\).\n\n<<<2950/9263>>>"
