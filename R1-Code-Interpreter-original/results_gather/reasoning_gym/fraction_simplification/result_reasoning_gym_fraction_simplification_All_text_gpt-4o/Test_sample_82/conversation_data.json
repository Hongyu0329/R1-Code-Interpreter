    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{3211}{7501}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator (3211) and the denominator (7501). If the GCD is greater than 1, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD to simplify the fraction.\n\nStep 1: Check if 3211 and 7501 have any common factors other than 1.\n\n- We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 3211 and 7501.\n\nStep 2: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n- Divide 7501 by 3211 and find the remainder:\n  \\[\n  7501 \\div 3211 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 7501 - 2 \\times 3211 = 1079\n  \\]\n\n- Now, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 3211 and 1079:\n  \\[\n  3211 \\div 1079 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 3211 - 2 \\times 1079 = 1053\n  \\]\n\n- Apply the Euclidean algorithm to 1079 and 1053:\n  \\[\n  1079 \\div 1053 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 1079 - 1 \\times 1053 = 26\n  \\]\n\n- Apply the Euclidean algorithm to 1053 and 26:\n  \\[\n  1053 \\div 26 = 40 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 1053 - 40 \\times 26 = 13\n  \\]\n\n- Apply the Euclidean algorithm to 26 and 13:\n  \\[\n  26 \\div 13 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 26 - 2 \\times 13 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 13.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.\n\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (13):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3211}{7501} = \\frac{3211 \\div 13}{7501 \\div 13} = \\frac{247}{577}\n  \\]\n\nStep 4: Verify that \\(\\frac{247}{577}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\n- Check if 247 and 577 have any common factors other than 1. Since both are prime numbers, their only common factor is 1.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{247}{577}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<\\frac{247}{577}>>>"
