    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{13865}{16933}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have the fraction \\(\\frac{13865}{16933}\\).\n\n2. **Find the GCD**: \n   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 13865 and 16933.\n   - Start by dividing the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process with the divisor and the remainder until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Apply the Euclidean algorithm**:\n   - Divide 16933 by 13865:\n     \\[\n     16933 \\div 13865 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 16933 - 13865 \\times 1 = 3068\n     \\]\n   - Divide 13865 by 3068:\n     \\[\n     13865 \\div 3068 = 4 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 13865 - 3068 \\times 4 = 593\n     \\]\n   - Divide 3068 by 593:\n     \\[\n     3068 \\div 593 = 5 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 3068 - 593 \\times 5 = 103\n     \\]\n   - Divide 593 by 103:\n     \\[\n     593 \\div 103 = 5 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 593 - 103 \\times 5 = 78\n     \\]\n   - Divide 103 by 78:\n     \\[\n     103 \\div 78 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 103 - 78 \\times 1 = 25\n     \\]\n   - Divide 78 by 25:\n     \\[\n     78 \\div 25 = 3 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 78 - 25 \\times 3 = 3\n     \\]\n   - Divide 25 by 3:\n     \\[\n     25 \\div 3 = 8 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 25 - 3 \\times 8 = 1\n     \\]\n   - Divide 3 by 1:\n     \\[\n     3 \\div 1 = 3 \\quad \\text{remainder} = 3 - 1 \\times 3 = 0\n     \\]\n\n   The last non-zero remainder is 1, so the GCD of 13865 and 16933 is 1.\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   - Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{13865}{16933}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{13865}{16933}\\)>>>"
