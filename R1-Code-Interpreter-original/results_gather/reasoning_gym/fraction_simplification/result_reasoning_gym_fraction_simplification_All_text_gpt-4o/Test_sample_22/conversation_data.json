    "To simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{2679}{17784}\\) to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and then divide both by this GCD.\n\n1. **Find the GCD of 2679 and 17784:**\n\n   - **Prime Factorization:**\n     - Start with the numerator, 2679:\n       - Check divisibility by 2: 2679 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n       - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \\(2 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 24\\), which is divisible by 3. Divide 2679 by 3:\n         \\[\n         2679 \\div 3 = 893\n         \\]\n       - Check 893 for divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \\(8 + 9 + 3 = 20\\), not divisible by 3.\n       - Check divisibility by 5: 893 does not end in 0 or 5, not divisible by 5.\n       - Check divisibility by 7: Perform division:\n         \\[\n         893 \\div 7 \\approx 127.57\n         \\]\n         Not divisible by 7.\n       - Check divisibility by 11: Alternating sum of digits \\(8 - 9 + 3 = 2\\), not divisible by 11.\n       - Check divisibility by 13: Perform division:\n         \\[\n         893 \\div 13 = 68.69\n         \\]\n         Not divisible by 13.\n       - Check divisibility by 17: Perform division:\n         \\[\n         893 \\div 17 = 52.53\n         \\]\n         Not divisible by 17.\n       - Check divisibility by 19: Perform division:\n         \\[\n         893 \\div 19 = 47\n         \\]\n         893 is divisible by 19. Divide:\n         \\[\n         893 \\div 19 = 47\n         \\]\n       - 47 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 2679 is \\(3 \\times 19 \\times 47\\).\n\n     - Now, factorize the denominator, 17784:\n       - Check divisibility by 2: 17784 is even, divide by 2:\n         \\[\n         17784 \\div 2 = 8892\n         \\]\n       - 8892 is even, divide by 2:\n         \\[\n         8892 \\div 2 = 4446\n         \\]\n       - 4446 is even, divide by 2:\n         \\[\n         4446 \\div 2 = 2223\n         \\]\n       - Check 2223 for divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9\\), divisible by 3. Divide:\n         \\[\n         2223 \\div 3 = 741\n         \\]\n       - Check 741 for divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \\(7 + 4 + 1 = 12\\), divisible by 3. Divide:\n         \\[\n         741 \\div 3 = 247\n         \\]\n       - Check 247 for divisibility by 7: Perform division:\n         \\[\n         247 \\div 7 = 35.2857\n         \\]\n         Not divisible by 7.\n       - Check divisibility by 11: Alternating sum of digits \\(2 - 4 + 7 = 5\\), not divisible by 11.\n       - Check divisibility by 13: Perform division:\n         \\[\n         247 \\div 13 = 19\n         \\]\n         247 is divisible by 13. Divide:\n         \\[\n         247 \\div 13 = 19\n         \\]\n       - 19 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 17784 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 13 \\times 19\\).\n\n2. **Determine the GCD:**\n   - Common prime factors: 3 and 19.\n   - GCD is \\(3^1 \\times 19^1 = 57\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (57):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2679}{17784} = \\frac{2679 \\div 57}{17784 \\div 57} = \\frac{47}{312}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Check if \\(\\frac{47}{312}\\) is in its simplest form:**\n   - 47 is a prime number and does not divide 312, so \\(\\frac{47}{312}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{47}{312}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<\\(\\frac{47}{312}\\)>>>"
