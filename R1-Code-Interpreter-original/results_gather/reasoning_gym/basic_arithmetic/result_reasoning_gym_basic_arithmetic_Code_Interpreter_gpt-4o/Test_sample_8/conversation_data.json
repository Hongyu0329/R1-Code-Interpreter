    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\(-3 + 2 \\times -9 \\times -5 + -3\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, perform the multiplication: \\(2 \\times -9 \\times -5\\).\n2. Then, add and subtract the results in sequence.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = -3 + 2 * -9 * -5 + -3\nresult\nassistant > The final answer to the expression \\(-3 + 2 \\times -9 \\times -5 + -3\\) is \\(\\boxed{84}\\).\n\nSo, the output in the specified format is: <<<84>>>"
