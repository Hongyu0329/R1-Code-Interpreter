    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\((6 + -4 - 0 \\times -5 - -3) / 5\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   \\[\n   6 + (-4) - 0 \\times (-5) - (-3)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Perform the multiplication inside the parentheses.\n   \\[\n   0 \\times -5 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   \\[\n   6 + (-4) - 0 - (-3) = 6 - 4 + 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n   \\[\n   6 - 4 + 3 = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Division**: Finally, divide the result by 5.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{5} = 1\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\nThe final answer is <<<1>>>."
