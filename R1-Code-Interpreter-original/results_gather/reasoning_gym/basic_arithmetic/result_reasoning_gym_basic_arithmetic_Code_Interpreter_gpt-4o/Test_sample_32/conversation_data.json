    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\(-9 + -1 \\times -3 \\times -5 + 4\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, perform the multiplication: \\(-1 \\times -3 \\times -5\\).\n2. Then, add and subtract the results in sequence: \\(-9 + \\text{(result from step 1)} + 4\\).\n\nLet's calculate it.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = -9 + (-1 * -3 * -5) + 4\nresult\nassistant > The final answer is \\(\\text{<<<-20>>>}\\)."
