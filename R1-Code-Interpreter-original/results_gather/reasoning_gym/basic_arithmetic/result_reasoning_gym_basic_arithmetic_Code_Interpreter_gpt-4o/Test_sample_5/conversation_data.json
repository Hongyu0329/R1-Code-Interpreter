    "\nassistant > To solve the expression \\(-(2 - 7 + 5 \\times 0 - 4) / 1\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Inside the parentheses: \\(2 - 7 + 5 \\times 0 - 4\\)\n2. Perform the multiplication: \\(5 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n3. Substitute back into the expression: \\(2 - 7 + 0 - 4\\)\n4. Perform the operations from left to right:\n   - \\(2 - 7 = -5\\)\n   - \\(-5 + 0 = -5\\)\n   - \\(-5 - 4 = -9\\)\n\nNow, substitute back into the original expression:\n\n\\(-(-9) / 1\\)\n\nFinally, calculate the division:\n\n\\(-(-9) / 1 = 9\\)\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<9>>>}\n\\]"
