    "To solve the expression \\(-\\left(\\frac{(77 - 14)}{3}\\right) / 21 + (-21)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then division, and finally addition/subtraction.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Calculate \\(77 - 14\\).\n2. **Division**: Divide the result by 3.\n3. **Negation**: Apply the negative sign to the result of the division.\n4. **Division**: Divide the negated result by 21.\n5. **Addition**: Add \\(-21\\) to the result.\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 77 - 14\nresult = 77 - 14\n\n# Step 2: Divide the result by 3\nresult /= 3\n\n# Step 3: Apply the negative sign\nresult = -result\n\n# Step 4: Divide by 21\nresult /= 21\n\n# Step 5: Add -21\nresult += -21\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression. Based on the calculations, the final answer to the expression \\(-\\left(\\frac{(77 - 14)}{3}\\right) / 21 + (-21)\\) is:\n\n<<<-22.0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -( ( ( 77 - 14 ) / 3 ) ) / 21 + -21.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
