    "To solve the expression \\(-( -1 + ( 0 * -2 ) / 3 + 6 )\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The expression inside the parentheses is \\(-1 + ( 0 * -2 ) / 3 + 6\\).\n2. **Multiplication and Division**: Inside the parentheses, we first handle the multiplication and division:\n   - \\(0 * -2 = 0\\)\n   - \\(0 / 3 = 0\\)\n3. **Addition**: Now, the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to \\(-1 + 0 + 6\\).\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Simplify further:\n   - \\(-1 + 0 = -1\\)\n   - \\(-1 + 6 = 5\\)\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to \\(-(5)\\), which is \\(-5\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = -( -1 + ( 0 * -2 ) / 3 + 6 )\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression \\(-( -1 + ( 0 * -2 ) / 3 + 6 )\\) is \\(-5.0\\). The result is a floating-point number due to the division operation, but it is equivalent to \\(-5\\) in integer terms.\n\n<<<-5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
