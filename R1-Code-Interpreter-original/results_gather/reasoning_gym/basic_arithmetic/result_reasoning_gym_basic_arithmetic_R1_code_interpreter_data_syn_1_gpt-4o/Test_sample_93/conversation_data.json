    "To solve the problem of calculating the sum of 89, -10, and 56, we can break it down into simple arithmetic operations. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 89 + (-10) + 56 \\]\n\nWe can compute this step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the first two numbers: \\( 89 + (-10) \\).\n2. Then add the result to the third number: \\( \\text{result} + 56 \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of the numbers\nresult = 89 + (-10) + 56\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the calculation.",
    "The calculation of the sum \\( 89 + (-10) + 56 \\) results in 135. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<135>>>"
