    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-294 + 735\\), we need to perform a simple arithmetic operation: addition. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: We have two numbers, \\(-294\\) and \\(735\\).\n2. **Perform the addition**: We need to add these two numbers together.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of -294 and 735\nresult = -294 + 735\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the addition.",
    "The calculation of \\(-294 + 735\\) results in \\(441\\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<441>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -294 + 735.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
