    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-539 \\times -405\\), we need to consider the multiplication of two negative numbers. The product of two negative numbers is positive. Therefore, the result will be a positive number.\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n539 \\times 405\n\\]\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I will write a Python script to compute this multiplication.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of -539 and -405\nresult = -539 * -405\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the product of \\(-539 \\times -405\\) is calculated to be 218295. Since both numbers are negative, their product is positive.\n\n<<<218295>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -539 * -405.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
