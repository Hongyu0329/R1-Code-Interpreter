    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( -286 + 539 - 351 ) / 98 + 907 ) / 4\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). \n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Start with the innermost parentheses: \\(-286 + 539 - 351\\).\n2. **Division**: Divide the result of the parentheses by 98.\n3. **Addition**: Add 907 to the result of the division.\n4. **Negation**: Apply the negation to the result of the addition.\n5. **Division**: Finally, divide the result by 4.\n\nLet's compute this step by step using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the innermost parentheses\ninner_parentheses = -286 + 539 - 351\n\n# Step 2: Divide the result by 98\ndivision_result = inner_parentheses / 98\n\n# Step 3: Add 907 to the result\naddition_result = division_result + 907\n\n# Step 4: Apply negation\nnegation_result = -addition_result\n\n# Step 5: Divide the result by 4\nfinal_result = negation_result / 4\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression. Based on the calculations, the final result of the expression \\(-( -( -286 + 539 - 351 ) / 98 + 907 ) / 4\\) is \\(-226.5\\).\n\n<<<-226.5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -( -( -286 + 539 - 351 ) / 98 + 907 ) / 4.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
