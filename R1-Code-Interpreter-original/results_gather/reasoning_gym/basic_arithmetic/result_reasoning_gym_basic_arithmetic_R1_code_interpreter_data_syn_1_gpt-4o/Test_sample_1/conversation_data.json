    "To solve the expression \\(-29 - 67 \\times 36 + 67 \\times 29 - 76\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). \n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   - Calculate \\(67 \\times 36\\)\n   - Calculate \\(67 \\times 29\\)\n\n2. **Subtraction and Addition**:\n   - Substitute the results from the multiplication into the expression.\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the multiplications\nmult1 = 67 * 36\nmult2 = 67 * 29\n\n# Step 2: Substitute and compute the final expression\nresult = -29 - mult1 + mult2 - 76\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -29 - 67 * 36 + 67 * 29 - 76.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
