    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-340 + -683\\), we need to add two negative numbers. When adding two negative numbers, the result is also negative, and the absolute values of the numbers are added together.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the absolute values of the numbers:\n   - The absolute value of \\(-340\\) is \\(340\\).\n   - The absolute value of \\(-683\\) is \\(683\\).\n\n2. Add the absolute values:\n   - \\(340 + 683 = 1023\\).\n\n3. Since both numbers are negative, the result will also be negative:\n   - The result is \\(-1023\\).\n\nTo confirm this calculation, let's write a simple Python script to perform the addition:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of -340 and -683\nresult = -340 + -683\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the addition.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The sum of \\(-340\\) and \\(-683\\) is \\(-1023\\).\n\n<<<-1023>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -340 + -683.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
