    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( -1 - -7 ) ) - 3\\), we need to carefully evaluate it step by step, considering the order of operations and the handling of negative signs.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: Start by evaluating the expression inside the innermost parentheses: \\(-1 - -7\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(-1 - -7\\) becomes \\(-1 + 7\\).\n\n2. **Simplify**: Calculate \\(-1 + 7\\).\n   - This results in \\(6\\).\n\n3. **Negation**: Apply the negation to the result from step 2.\n   - The expression becomes \\(-6\\).\n\n4. **Outer Negation**: Apply the outer negation to the result from step 3.\n   - The expression becomes \\(-(-6)\\), which simplifies to \\(6\\).\n\n5. **Final Subtraction**: Subtract 3 from the result of step 4.\n   - The expression becomes \\(6 - 3\\).\n\n6. **Final Calculation**: Calculate \\(6 - 3\\).\n   - This results in \\(3\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = -(-( -1 - -7 )) - 3\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -( -( -1 - -7 ) ) - 3.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
