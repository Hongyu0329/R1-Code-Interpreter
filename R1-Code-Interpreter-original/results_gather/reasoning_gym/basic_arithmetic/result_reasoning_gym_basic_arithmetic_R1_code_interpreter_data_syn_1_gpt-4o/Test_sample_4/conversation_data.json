    "To solve the expression \\(0 + 7 - \\frac{-1}{1}\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Division**: First, we handle the division \\(\\frac{-1}{1}\\), which simplifies to \\(-1\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction**: Next, we substitute \\(-1\\) into the expression, resulting in \\(0 + 7 - (-1)\\).\n\n3. **Handling Negative Sign**: Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart. Therefore, \\(7 - (-1)\\) becomes \\(7 + 1\\).\n\n4. **Addition**: Finally, we perform the addition: \\(0 + 7 + 1\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = 0 + 7 - (-1) / 1\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the result of the expression \\(0 + 7 - \\frac{-1}{1}\\) is 8.0. The division operation resulted in a float, which is why the final answer is presented as a floating-point number.\n\n<<<8.0>>>"
