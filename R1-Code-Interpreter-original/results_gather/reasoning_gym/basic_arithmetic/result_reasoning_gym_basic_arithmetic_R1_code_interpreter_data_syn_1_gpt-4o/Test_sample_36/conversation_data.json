    "To solve the expression \\(-( ( -8 / 1 ) * -7 ) - -3 + 5\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The expression inside the parentheses is \\(-8 / 1\\). This simplifies to \\(-8\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Next, we have \\((-8) * -7\\). Multiplying these gives us \\(56\\).\n\n3. **Negation**: The expression becomes \\(-56\\).\n\n4. **Subtraction and Addition**: Now, we have \\(-56 - -3 + 5\\). \n   - First, \\(-56 - -3\\) is equivalent to \\(-56 + 3\\), which equals \\(-53\\).\n   - Then, \\(-53 + 5\\) equals \\(-48\\).\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = -(( -8 / 1 ) * -7) - -3 + 5\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression \\(-( ( -8 / 1 ) * -7 ) - -3 + 5\\) is \\(-48.0\\). The result is a floating-point number due to the division operation, but it is equivalent to \\(-48\\) as an integer.\n\n<<<-48>>>"
