    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-5 \\times -6\\), we need to understand the rules of multiplication involving negative numbers. The rule is that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number. Therefore, the product of \\(-5\\) and \\(-6\\) should be a positive number.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nresult = -5 * -6\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The calculation of \\(-5 \\times -6\\) results in \\(30\\). This is consistent with the rule that the product of two negative numbers is positive.\n\n<<<30>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -5 * -6.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
