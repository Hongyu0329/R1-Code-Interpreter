    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\(5976 - (-2823) - 816\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Expression**: \n   - The expression involves subtraction and a negative number. \n   - Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart. Therefore, \\(5976 - (-2823)\\) is the same as \\(5976 + 2823\\).\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Calculation**:\n   - First, calculate \\(5976 + 2823\\).\n   - Then, subtract 816 from the result of the first calculation.\n\n3. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   - Let's use Python to perform these calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = 5976 - (-2823) - 816\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly. The expression \\(5976 - (-2823) - 816\\) simplifies to \\(5976 + 2823 - 816\\), which equals 7983.\n\n<<<7983>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate 5976 - -2823 - 816.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
