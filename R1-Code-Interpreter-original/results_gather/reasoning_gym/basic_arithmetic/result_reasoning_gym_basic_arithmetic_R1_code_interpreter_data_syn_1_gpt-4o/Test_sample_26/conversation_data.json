    "To solve the expression \\(-( -89 - 4 ) * ( ( -96 / 48 ) / 1 ) / 2\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: \n   - Inside the first parentheses: \\(-89 - 4\\).\n   - Inside the second parentheses: \\(-96 / 48\\).\n\n2. **Calculate inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(-89 - 4 = -93\\).\n   - \\(-96 / 48 = -2\\).\n\n3. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - The expression becomes \\(-( -93 ) * ( -2 / 1 ) / 2\\).\n\n4. **Simplify further**:\n   - \\(-( -93 ) = 93\\).\n   - \\(-2 / 1 = -2\\).\n\n5. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - The expression becomes \\(93 * -2 / 2\\).\n\n6. **Perform multiplication and division from left to right**:\n   - \\(93 * -2 = -186\\).\n   - \\(-186 / 2 = -93\\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = -(-89 - 4) * ((-96 / 48) / 1) / 2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the expression \\(-( -89 - 4 ) * ( ( -96 / 48 ) / 1 ) / 2\\) is \\(-93.0\\).\n\n<<<-93.0>>>"
