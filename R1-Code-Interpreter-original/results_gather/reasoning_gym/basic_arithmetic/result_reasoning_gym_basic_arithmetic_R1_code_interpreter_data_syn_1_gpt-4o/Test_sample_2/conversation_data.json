    "To solve the expression \\(-530 + 807 - (-253) + (-131) - (-301) + (-802)\\), we need to carefully handle the negative signs and perform the arithmetic operations step by step.\n\n1. **Identify and simplify double negatives**: \n   - The expression \\(-(-253)\\) becomes \\(+253\\).\n   - The expression \\(-(-301)\\) becomes \\(+301\\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the expression**: \n   - The expression becomes \\(-530 + 807 + 253 - 131 + 301 - 802\\).\n\n3. **Perform the arithmetic operations**:\n   - Start by adding and subtracting the numbers from left to right.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [-530, 807, 253, -131, 301, -802]\n\n# Calculate the sum\nresult = sum(numbers)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -530 + 807 - -253 + -131 - -301 + -802.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
