    "To solve the expression \\(136 - (-121) \\times 191\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves subtraction and multiplication.\n2. **Handle the negative sign**: The expression \\(136 - (-121) \\times 191\\) can be rewritten as \\(136 + 121 \\times 191\\) because subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive.\n3. **Perform the multiplication first**: Calculate \\(121 \\times 191\\).\n4. **Perform the addition**: Add the result of the multiplication to 136.\n\nLet's calculate the result using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = 136 + 121 * 191\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate 136 - -121 * 191.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
