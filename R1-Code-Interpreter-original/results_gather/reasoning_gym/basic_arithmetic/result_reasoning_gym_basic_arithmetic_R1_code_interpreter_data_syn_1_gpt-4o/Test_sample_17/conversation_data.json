    "To solve the problem of calculating \\( 393 + (-683) \\), we need to perform a simple arithmetic operation involving addition of a positive and a negative number. \n\nThe operation can be broken down as follows:\n- Start with the positive number: 393\n- Add the negative number: -683\n\nThis is equivalent to subtracting 683 from 393. Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the expression\nresult = 393 + (-683)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the calculation.",
    "The calculation \\( 393 + (-683) \\) results in \\(-290\\). This is because adding a negative number is equivalent to subtracting its absolute value from the other number.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-290>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( 393 + -683 ).\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
