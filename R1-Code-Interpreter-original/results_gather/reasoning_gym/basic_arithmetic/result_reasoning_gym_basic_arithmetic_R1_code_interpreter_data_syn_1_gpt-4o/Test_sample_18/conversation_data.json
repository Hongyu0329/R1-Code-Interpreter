    "To solve the expression \\(( ( 141 + 906 ) - 691 ) + -612 + 992\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is typically Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\(141 + 906\\).\n2. **Subtraction**: Subtract 691 from the result of the parentheses.\n3. **Addition/Subtraction**: Add -612 and then add 992 to the result.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses\nparentheses_result = 141 + 906\n\n# Step 2: Subtract 691 from the result of the parentheses\nsubtraction_result = parentheses_result - 691\n\n# Step 3: Add -612 and then add 992\nfinal_result = subtraction_result + (-612) + 992\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( ( 141 + 906 ) - 691 ) + -612 + 992.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
