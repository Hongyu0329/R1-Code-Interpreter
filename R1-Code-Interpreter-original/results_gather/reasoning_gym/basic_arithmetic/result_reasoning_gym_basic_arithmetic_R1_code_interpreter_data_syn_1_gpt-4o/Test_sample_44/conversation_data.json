    "To solve the problem of calculating the sum of the numbers -268, 3701, -771, and -4359, we can break it down into a simple arithmetic operation. The task is to add these numbers together to find the total sum.\n\nLet's perform the calculation step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first number: -268\n2. Add the second number: -268 + 3701\n3. Add the third number: (-268 + 3701) + (-771)\n4. Add the fourth number: ((-268 + 3701) + (-771)) - 4359\n\nTo ensure accuracy and efficiency, we can use a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [-268, 3701, -771, -4359]\n\n# Calculate the sum\ntotal_sum = sum(numbers)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_sum)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the sum of the numbers -268, 3701, -771, and -4359. The result of this calculation is -1697.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1697>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -268 + 3701 + -771 - 4359.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
