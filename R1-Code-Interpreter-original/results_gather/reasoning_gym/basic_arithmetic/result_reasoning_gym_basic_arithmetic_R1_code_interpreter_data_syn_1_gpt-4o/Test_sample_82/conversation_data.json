    "To solve the expression \\((-5 \\times 8) \\times -6\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is typically parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right.\n\n1. **Calculate the expression inside the parentheses**: \n   - \\(-5 \\times 8\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the result by -6**:\n   - Result from step 1 \\(\\times -6\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (-5 * 8) * -6\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\((-5 \\times 8) \\times -6\\) results in 240. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- First, calculate \\(-5 \\times 8 = -40\\).\n- Then, multiply \\(-40 \\times -6 = 240\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<240>>>"
