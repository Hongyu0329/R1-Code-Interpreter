    "To solve the expression \\((-7162 \\times 7394) + (3817 \\times 9281) + 2255\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. First, we perform the multiplications:\n   - Calculate \\(-7162 \\times 7394\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3817 \\times 9281\\).\n\n2. Then, we add the results of the multiplications and the constant 2255.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (-7162 * 7394) + (3817 * 9281) + 2255\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final result of the expression.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( -7162 * 7394 ) + 3817 * 9281 + 2255.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
