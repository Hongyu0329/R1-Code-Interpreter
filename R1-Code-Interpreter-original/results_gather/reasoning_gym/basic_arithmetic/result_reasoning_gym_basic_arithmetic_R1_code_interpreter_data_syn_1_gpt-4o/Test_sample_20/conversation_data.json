    "To solve the expression \\((-5 - -(-( -2 + -4 )) - -2)\\), we need to carefully evaluate it step by step, considering the order of operations and the handling of negative signs.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: Start by evaluating the expression inside the innermost parentheses: \\((-2 + -4)\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(-6\\).\n\n2. **Double Negative**: Next, handle the double negative sign in \\(-(-6)\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(6\\).\n\n3. **Substitute Back**: Substitute back into the original expression: \\((-5 - 6 - -2)\\).\n\n4. **Simplify Further**: Evaluate the expression from left to right:\n   - \\(-5 - 6\\) simplifies to \\(-11\\).\n   - \\(-11 - -2\\) simplifies to \\(-11 + 2\\), which is \\(-9\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = -5 - -(-( -2 + -4 )) - -2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "It seems there was an error in my manual calculation. Let's go through the steps again to identify the mistake:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: Evaluate \\((-2 + -4)\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(-6\\).\n\n2. **Double Negative**: Handle the double negative sign in \\(-(-6)\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(6\\).\n\n3. **Substitute Back**: Substitute back into the original expression: \\((-5 - 6 - -2)\\).\n\n4. **Simplify Further**: Evaluate the expression from left to right:\n   - \\(-5 - 6\\) simplifies to \\(-11\\).\n   - \\(-11 - -2\\) simplifies to \\(-11 + 2\\), which is \\(-9\\).\n\nIt seems I made a mistake in the substitution step. Let's correct it:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: \\((-2 + -4)\\) simplifies to \\(-6\\).\n2. **Double Negative**: \\(-(-6)\\) simplifies to \\(6\\).\n3. **Substitute Back**: \\((-5 - 6 - -2)\\) should actually be \\((-5 - 6 + 2)\\).\n4. **Simplify Further**: \n   - \\(-5 - 6\\) simplifies to \\(-11\\).\n   - \\(-11 + 2\\) simplifies to \\(-9\\).\n\nThe correct expression should be \\((-5 - 6 + 2)\\), which simplifies to \\(-9\\).\n\nLet's correct the final answer based on the code output:\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( -5 - -( ( -2 + -4 ) ) - -2 ).\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
