    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the product of two numbers: 765 and -805, and then negate the result. The expression is given as:\n\n\\[\n-(765 \\times -805)\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the product of 765 and -805. Since one of the numbers is negative, the product will be negative. However, because we are negating the entire product, the final result will be positive.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product\nproduct = 765 * -805\n\n# Negate the product\nresult = -product\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the calculation is 615825. Therefore, the final answer to the expression \\(-(765 \\times -805)\\) is:\n\n<<<615825>>>"
