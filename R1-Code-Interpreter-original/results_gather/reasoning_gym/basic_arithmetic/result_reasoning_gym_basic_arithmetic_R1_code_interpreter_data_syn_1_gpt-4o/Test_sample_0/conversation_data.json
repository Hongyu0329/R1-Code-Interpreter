    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-22 - (-93)\\), we need to understand the operation involved. The expression involves subtracting a negative number, which is equivalent to adding the positive version of that number. Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n-22 - (-93) = -22 + 93\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to perform the addition of \\(-22\\) and \\(93\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of -22 - (-93)\nresult = -22 - (-93)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the calculation.",
    "The calculation \\(-22 - (-93)\\) simplifies to \\(-22 + 93\\), which equals \\(71\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<71>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -22 - -93.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
