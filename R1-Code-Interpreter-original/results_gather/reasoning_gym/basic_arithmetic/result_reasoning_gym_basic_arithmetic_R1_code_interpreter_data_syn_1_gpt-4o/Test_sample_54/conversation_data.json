    "To solve the problem of calculating 575 + 683, we can simply add these two numbers together. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation. However, to ensure accuracy and demonstrate the process, I will write a small Python script to perform this addition.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of 575 and 683\nresult = 575 + 683\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sum of the two numbers.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate 575 + 683.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
