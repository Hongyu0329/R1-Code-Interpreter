    "To solve the expression \\((7463 + 4941) \\times -3299\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\(7463 + 4941\\).\n2. **Multiplication**: Then, we multiply the result by \\(-3299\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the sum inside the parentheses\nsum_result = 7463 + 4941\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by -3299\nfinal_result = sum_result * -3299\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly. The expression \\((7463 + 4941) \\times -3299\\) evaluates to \\(-40920796\\).\n\n<<<-40920796>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( ( 7463 + 4941 ) ) * -3299.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
