    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-20 \\times -106\\), we need to understand the rules of multiplication involving negative numbers. The product of two negative numbers is positive. Therefore, the result of multiplying \\(-20\\) by \\(-106\\) will be a positive number.\n\nLet's calculate the product:\n\n\\[\n-20 \\times -106 = 20 \\times 106\n\\]\n\nTo find the product of 20 and 106, we can perform the multiplication directly. Let's write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of -20 and -106\nresult = -20 * -106\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the result of the multiplication.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 2120. This confirms that the product of \\(-20\\) and \\(-106\\) is indeed 2120.\n\n<<<2120>>>"
