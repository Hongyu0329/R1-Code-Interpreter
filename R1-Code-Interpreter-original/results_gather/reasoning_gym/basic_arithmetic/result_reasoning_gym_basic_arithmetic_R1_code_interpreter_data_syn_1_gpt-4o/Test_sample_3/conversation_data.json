    "To solve the given expression, we need to break it down into smaller parts and evaluate each part step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n-( -483 \\times -873 ) \\times -( -253 + -802 / 2 ) + 383\n\\]\n\nLet's evaluate this step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the first parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -483 \\times -873\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the division inside the second parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -802 / 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the addition inside the second parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -253 + \\text{(result from step 2)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the negation of the results from steps 1 and 3:**\n   \\[\n   -(\\text{result from step 1}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -(\\text{result from step 3})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Evaluate the multiplication of the results from step 4:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{result from step 4a} \\times \\text{result from step 4b}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finally, add 383 to the result from step 5.**\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Evaluate the multiplication inside the first parentheses\nstep1 = -483 * -873\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate the division inside the second parentheses\nstep2 = -802 / 2\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the addition inside the second parentheses\nstep3 = -253 + step2\n\n# Step 4: Evaluate the negation of the results from steps 1 and 3\nstep4a = -step1\nstep4b = -step3\n\n# Step 5: Evaluate the multiplication of the results from step 4\nstep5 = step4a * step4b\n\n# Step 6: Add 383 to the result from step 5\nresult = step5 + 383\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is \\(-275764603.0\\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-275764603.0>>>"
