    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( 499 * -980 ) ) - ( -693 * -472 + 607 )\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and evaluate each part step by step.\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost expressions:\n   - \\(499 \\times -980\\)\n   - \\(-693 \\times -472\\)\n\n2. Apply the negations and additions:\n   - \\(-(-(499 \\times -980))\\)\n   - \\(-693 \\times -472 + 607\\)\n\n3. Subtract the results from step 2.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the innermost expressions\npart1 = 499 * -980\npart2 = -693 * -472\n\n# Apply negations and additions\nresult1 = -(-part1)\nresult2 = part2 + 607\n\n# Final calculation\nfinal_result = result1 - result2\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression. The final result of the calculation is \\(-816723\\).\n\n<<<-816723>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -( -( 499 * -980 ) ) - ( -693 * -472 + 607 ).\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
