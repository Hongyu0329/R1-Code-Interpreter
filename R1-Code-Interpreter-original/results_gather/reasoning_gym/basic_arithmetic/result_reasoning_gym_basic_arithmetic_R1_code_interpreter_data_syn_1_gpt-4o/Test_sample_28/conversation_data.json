    "To solve the expression \\(655 - (-43) \\times 623 + (-684)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). \n\n1. **Identify the operations**: \n   - Multiplication: \\(-43 \\times 623\\)\n   - Subtraction and addition: \\(655 - \\text{(result of multiplication)} + (-684)\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the multiplication**: \n   - \\(-43 \\times 623\\)\n\n3. **Substitute the result of the multiplication back into the expression** and perform the addition and subtraction.\n\nLet's calculate the multiplication first:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the multiplication\nmultiplication_result = -43 * 623\nprint(multiplication_result)\n```\n\nOnce we have the result of the multiplication, we can substitute it back into the expression and calculate the final result.",
    "Now that we have the result of the multiplication, which is \\(-26789\\), we can substitute it back into the expression and perform the remaining operations:\n\nThe expression becomes:\n\\[ 655 - (-26789) + (-684) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 655 + 26789 - 684 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the final result:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = 655 + 26789 - 684\nprint(final_result)\n```",
