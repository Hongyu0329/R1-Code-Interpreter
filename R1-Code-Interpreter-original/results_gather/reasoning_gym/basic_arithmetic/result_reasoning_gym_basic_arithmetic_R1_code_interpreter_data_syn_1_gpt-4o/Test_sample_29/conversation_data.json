    "To solve the expression \\(-17 - (-17) \\times (-92) - (-8) - (-83)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Identify and simplify the negative signs**: \n   - \\(-(-17)\\) becomes \\(+17\\)\n   - \\(-(-8)\\) becomes \\(+8\\)\n   - \\(-(-83)\\) becomes \\(+83\\)\n\n2. **Simplify the expression**: \n   - The expression becomes \\(-17 + 17 \\times (-92) + 8 + 83\\)\n\n3. **Perform multiplication**: \n   - \\(17 \\times (-92) = -1564\\)\n\n4. **Substitute back into the expression**: \n   - The expression becomes \\(-17 - 1564 + 8 + 83\\)\n\n5. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**:\n   - \\(-17 - 1564 = -1581\\)\n   - \\(-1581 + 8 = -1573\\)\n   - \\(-1573 + 83 = -1490\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = -17 - (-17) * -92 - (-8) - (-83)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -17 - -17 * -92 - -8 - -83.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
