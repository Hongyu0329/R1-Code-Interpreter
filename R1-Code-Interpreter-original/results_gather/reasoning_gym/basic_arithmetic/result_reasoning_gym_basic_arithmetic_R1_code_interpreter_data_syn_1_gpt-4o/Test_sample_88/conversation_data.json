    "To solve the expression \\(-( -45 + -35 ) * -( ( -44 + 29 + -46 ) ) - -75\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication, and finally addition or subtraction.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Calculate \\(-45 + -35\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-44 + 29 + -46\\).\n\n2. **Negate the results of the parentheses:**\n   - Negate the result of \\(-45 + -35\\).\n   - Negate the result of \\(-44 + 29 + -46\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the negated results:**\n   - Multiply the two negated results from step 2.\n\n4. **Subtract the result of the multiplication from \\(-75\\):**\n   - Finally, subtract the result of the multiplication from \\(-75\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Evaluate the innermost parentheses\ninner1 = -45 + -35\ninner2 = -44 + 29 + -46\n\n# Step 2: Negate the results\nneg_inner1 = -inner1\nneg_inner2 = -inner2\n\n# Step 3: Multiply the negated results\nproduct = neg_inner1 * neg_inner2\n\n# Step 4: Subtract the result of the multiplication from -75\nresult = product - -75\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(-( -45 + -35 ) * -( ( -44 + 29 + -46 ) ) - -75\\) is 4955.\n\n<<<4955>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -( -45 + -35 ) * -( ( -44 + 29 + -46 ) ) - -75.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
