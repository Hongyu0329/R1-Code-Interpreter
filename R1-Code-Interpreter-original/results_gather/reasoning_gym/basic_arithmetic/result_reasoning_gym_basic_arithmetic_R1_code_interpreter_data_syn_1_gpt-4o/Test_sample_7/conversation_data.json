    "To solve the expression \\(-548 - 493 + 386\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction.\n\n1. Start with the first two numbers: \\(-548 - 493\\).\n2. Then, add the result to 386.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step:\n\n- First, calculate \\(-548 - 493\\).\n- Then, add 386 to the result of the first calculation.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = -548 - 493 + 386\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(-548 - 493 + 386\\) results in \\(-655\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-655>>>"
