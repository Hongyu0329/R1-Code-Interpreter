    "To solve the expression \\(( ( 1 \\times 9 + -8 \\times 8 ) ) - -( ( 8 - -4 ) )\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(1 \\times 9 + -8 \\times 8\\)\n     - Calculate \\(1 \\times 9 = 9\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-8 \\times 8 = -64\\)\n     - Add the results: \\(9 + (-64) = -55\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(8 - -4\\)\n     - Subtract: \\(8 - (-4) = 8 + 4 = 12\\)\n\n2. **Combine the results:**\n\n   - The expression becomes: \\(-55 - -(12)\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(-55 + 12\\)\n\n3. **Final calculation:**\n\n   - Calculate \\(-55 + 12 = -43\\)\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = 1 * 9 + (-8 * 8)\npart2 = 8 - (-4)\nresult = part1 - (-part2)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
