    "To solve the expression \\(-40 \\times ((-98) + (-92))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\((-98) + (-92)\\).\n2. **Multiplication**: Then, we multiply the result by \\(-40\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the sum inside the parentheses: \\((-98) + (-92)\\).\n2. Multiply the result by \\(-40\\).\n\nLet's compute this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the sum inside the parentheses\nsum_inside_parentheses = -98 + -92\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by -40\nresult = -40 * sum_inside_parentheses\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully. The expression \\(-40 \\times ((-98) + (-92))\\) evaluates to 7600.\n\n<<<7600>>>"
