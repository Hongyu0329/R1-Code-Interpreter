    "To solve the expression \\(-( 78 - -944 / 118 + 493 ) / 3\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: We need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first: \\(78 - -944 / 118 + 493\\).\n\n2. **Division**: Inside the parentheses, perform the division first: \\(-944 / 118\\).\n\n3. **Subtraction and Addition**: After the division, perform the subtraction and addition inside the parentheses.\n\n4. **Negation and Division**: Finally, negate the result from the parentheses and divide by 3.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the division inside the parentheses\ndivision_result = -944 / 118\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses\nparentheses_result = 78 - division_result + 493\n\n# Step 3: Negate the result and divide by 3\nfinal_result = -(parentheses_result) / 3\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(-( 78 - -944 / 118 + 493 ) / 3\\) is \\(-193.0\\).\n\n<<<-193.0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -( 78 - -944 / 118 + 493 ) / 3.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
