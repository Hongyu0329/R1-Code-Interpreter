    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order. The expression given is:\n\n\\[ 6845 \\times 5489 \\times 1327 + 388 + (-1002) \\]\n\nThe order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) dictates that we first perform the multiplication, then the addition and subtraction. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Calculate the product of 6845, 5489, and 1327.\n2. Add 388 to the result of the multiplication.\n3. Subtract 1002 from the result of the addition.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the product of the three numbers\nproduct = 6845 * 5489 * 1327\n\n# Step 2: Add 388 to the product\nresult_with_addition = product + 388\n\n# Step 3: Subtract 1002 from the result\nfinal_result = result_with_addition - 1002\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
