    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-9 \\times 4\\), we need to perform a simple multiplication operation. The multiplication of a negative number by a positive number results in a negative number. Therefore, the result of \\(-9 \\times 4\\) will be negative.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nresult = -9 * 4\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of the multiplication. Therefore, the calculation of \\(-9 \\times 4\\) is \\(-36\\).\n\n<<<-36>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -9 * 4.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
