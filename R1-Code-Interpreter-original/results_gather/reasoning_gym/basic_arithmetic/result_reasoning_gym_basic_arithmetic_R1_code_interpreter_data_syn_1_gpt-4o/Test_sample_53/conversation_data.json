    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( 9 / 3 ) ) ) / 1\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The innermost parentheses contain the expression \\(9 / 3\\).\n2. **Division**: Calculate \\(9 / 3\\), which equals 3.\n3. **Negation**: The expression now becomes \\(-( -( 3 ) ) ) / 1\\).\n4. **Negation**: The first negation changes 3 to -3, and the second negation changes -3 back to 3.\n5. **Division**: Finally, divide 3 by 1, which equals 3.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nresult = -( -( 9 / 3 ) ) / 1\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the expression and print the result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(-( -( 9 / 3 ) ) ) / 1\\) results in 3.0. The division by 1 does not change the value, and the double negation returns the original positive value.\n\n<<<3.0>>>"
