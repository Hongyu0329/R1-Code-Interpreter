    "To solve the problem of calculating \\( \\frac{3}{3} \\), we can perform a simple division operation. The division of any number by itself, except zero, results in 1. Therefore, \\( \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\).\n\nLet's confirm this by executing a small Python script to perform the division and print the result.\n\n```python\nresult = 3 / 3\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the division.",
    "The code output confirms that the result of \\( \\frac{3}{3} \\) is indeed 1.0. The division operation in Python returns a floating-point number, which is why the result is displayed as 1.0 instead of 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate 3 / 3.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
