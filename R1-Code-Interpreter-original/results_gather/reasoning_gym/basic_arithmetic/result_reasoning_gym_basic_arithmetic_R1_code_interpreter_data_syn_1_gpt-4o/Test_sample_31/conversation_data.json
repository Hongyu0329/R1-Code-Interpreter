    "To solve the expression \\((-7426 + -3364 - -7577) * -2710 - -2305\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication, and finally addition/subtraction.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses: \\(-7426 + -3364 - -7577\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(-7426 - 3364 + 7577\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Once we have the result from the parentheses, multiply it by \\(-2710\\).\n\n3. **Subtraction**: Finally, subtract \\(-2305\\) from the result of the multiplication.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses\nparentheses_result = -7426 + -3364 - -7577\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by -2710\nmultiplication_result = parentheses_result * -2710\n\n# Step 3: Subtract -2305 from the multiplication result\nfinal_result = multiplication_result - -2305\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully. The final result of the expression \\((-7426 + -3364 - -7577) * -2710 - -2305\\) is:\n\n<<<8709535>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( -7426 + -3364 - -7577 ) * -2710 - -2305.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
