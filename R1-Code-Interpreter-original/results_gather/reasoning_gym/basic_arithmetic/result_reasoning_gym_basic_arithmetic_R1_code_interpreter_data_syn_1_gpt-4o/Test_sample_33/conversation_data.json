    "To solve the expression \\( -( ( -852 / 3 ) ) - 277 ) + 83 * 759 \\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have \\(-852 / 3\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-852 / 3\\).\n\n2. **Negation**: Apply the negation to the result of the division.\n\n3. **Subtraction**: Subtract 277 from the result of the negation.\n\n4. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(83 * 759\\).\n\n5. **Addition**: Add the result of the multiplication to the result of the subtraction.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate -852 / 3\ndivision_result = -852 / 3\n\n# Step 2: Apply negation\nnegation_result = -division_result\n\n# Step 3: Subtract 277\nsubtraction_result = negation_result - 277\n\n# Step 4: Calculate 83 * 759\nmultiplication_result = 83 * 759\n\n# Step 5: Add the results of subtraction and multiplication\nfinal_result = subtraction_result + multiplication_result\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the final result of the expression \\( -( ( -852 / 3 ) ) - 277 ) + 83 * 759 \\) is 63004.0.\n\n<<<63004>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( -( ( -852 / 3 ) ) - 277 ) + 83 * 759.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
