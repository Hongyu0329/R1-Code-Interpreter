    "To solve the expression \\( ( -( -56 \\times -33 + -87 ) \\times 13 ) - -67 - 30 \\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents (none in this case), multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Calculate inside the parentheses**: \n   - First, calculate \\(-56 \\times -33\\).\n   - Then, add \\(-87\\) to the result.\n\n2. **Negate the result**: \n   - Multiply the result from step 1 by \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Multiply by 13**: \n   - Take the result from step 2 and multiply it by 13.\n\n4. **Subtract -67**: \n   - This is equivalent to adding 67.\n\n5. **Subtract 30**: \n   - Finally, subtract 30 from the result of step 4.\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate inside the parentheses\nresult = -56 * -33 + -87\n\n# Step 2: Negate the result\nresult = -result\n\n# Step 3: Multiply by 13\nresult *= 13\n\n# Step 4: Subtract -67 (equivalent to adding 67)\nresult += 67\n\n# Step 5: Subtract 30\nresult -= 30\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
