    "To solve the expression \\((6 + -4 - 0 * -5 - -3) / 5\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - Inside the parentheses: \\(6 + -4 - 0 * -5 - -3\\)\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Perform any multiplication inside the parentheses.\n   - \\(0 * -5 = 0\\)\n\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.\n   - \\(6 + -4 = 2\\)\n   - \\(2 - 0 = 2\\)\n   - \\(2 - -3 = 2 + 3 = 5\\)\n\n4. **Division**: Now divide the result by 5.\n   - \\(5 / 5 = 1\\)\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (6 + -4 - 0 * -5 - -3) / 5\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of the expression as 1.0. This confirms that the calculation was performed correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\((6 + -4 - 0 * -5 - -3) / 5\\) is:\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( 6 + -4 - 0 * -5 - -3 ) / 5.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
