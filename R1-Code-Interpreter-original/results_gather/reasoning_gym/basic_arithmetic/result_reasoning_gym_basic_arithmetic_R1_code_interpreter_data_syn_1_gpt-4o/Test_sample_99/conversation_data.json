    "To solve the expression \\(-195 \\times -200 + -(-545 / 109)\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(-195 \\times -200\\):**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - So, \\(-195 \\times -200 = 195 \\times 200\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(-545 / 109\\):**\n   - Division of a negative number by a positive number results in a negative number.\n   - So, \\(-545 / 109\\) will be a negative number.\n\n3. **Negate the result of \\(-545 / 109\\):**\n   - Negating a negative number results in a positive number.\n   - So, \\(-(-545 / 109)\\) will be a positive number.\n\n4. **Add the results from steps 1 and 3:**\n   - Add the positive result from step 1 to the positive result from step 3.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate -195 * -200\nproduct = -195 * -200\n\n# Step 2: Calculate -545 / 109\ndivision = -545 / 109\n\n# Step 3: Negate the result of the division\nnegated_division = -division\n\n# Step 4: Add the results from step 1 and step 3\nresult = product + negated_division\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(-195 \\times -200 + -(-545 / 109)\\) is 39005.0.\n\n<<<39005.0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -195 * -200 + -( -545 / 109 ).\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
