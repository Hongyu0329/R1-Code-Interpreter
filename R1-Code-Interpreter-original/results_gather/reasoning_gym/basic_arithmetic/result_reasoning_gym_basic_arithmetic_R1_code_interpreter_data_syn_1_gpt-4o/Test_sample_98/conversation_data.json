    "To solve the expression \\(-( ( 9044 \\times 1130 ) + 1764 ) + 2158 + \\frac{-9096}{758}\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses**: \\(9044 \\times 1130\\).\n2. **Add 1764 to the result of the multiplication**.\n3. **Negate the result from step 2**.\n4. **Divide -9096 by 758**.\n5. **Add the result from step 3 to 2158**.\n6. **Add the result from step 4 to the result from step 5**.\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 9044 * 1130\n\n# Step 2: Add 1764\naddition_result = multiplication_result + 1764\n\n# Step 3: Negate the result\nnegated_result = -addition_result\n\n# Step 4: Divide -9096 by 758\ndivision_result = -9096 / 758\n\n# Step 5: Add the result from step 3 to 2158\nintermediate_result = negated_result + 2158\n\n# Step 6: Add the result from step 4 to the result from step 5\nfinal_result = intermediate_result + division_result\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate -( ( 9044 * 1130 ) + 1764 ) + 2158 + -9096 / 758.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
