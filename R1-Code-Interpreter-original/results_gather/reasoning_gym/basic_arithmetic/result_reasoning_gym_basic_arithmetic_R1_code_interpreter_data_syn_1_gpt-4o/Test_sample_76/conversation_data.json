    "To solve the expression \\(-1 - (-3) + 0\\), we need to follow the order of operations and simplify the expression step by step.\n\n1. **Simplify the double negative**: The expression \\(-1 - (-3)\\) can be simplified by recognizing that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive of that number. Therefore, \\(-1 - (-3)\\) becomes \\(-1 + 3\\).\n\n2. **Perform the addition**: Now, we need to calculate \\(-1 + 3\\). This results in \\(2\\).\n\n3. **Add zero**: Finally, we add \\(0\\) to the result from the previous step. Since adding zero does not change the value, the final result remains \\(2\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using a simple Python script.\n\n```python\nresult = -1 - (-3) + 0\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<2>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output confirms that the calculation is correct. The final answer to the expression \\(-1 - (-3) + 0\\) is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
