    "To solve the expression \\( 439 \\times \\left( \\frac{245}{7} \\right) \\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Division inside the parentheses**: First, we calculate \\( \\frac{245}{7} \\).\n2. **Multiplication**: Then, we multiply the result by 439.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the division inside the parentheses\ndivision_result = 245 / 7\n\n# Multiply the result by 439\nfinal_result = 439 * division_result\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
