    "To solve the expression \\(55 + (-13) \\times (-69) - (-78) + (-43)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, we calculate the multiplication part of the expression \\((-13) \\times (-69)\\).\n2. **Addition and Subtraction**: Then, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the expression\nresult = 55 + (-13) * (-69) - (-78) + (-43)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The calculation of the expression \\(55 + (-13) \\times (-69) - (-78) + (-43)\\) results in 987. The steps involved were:\n\n1. Calculate \\((-13) \\times (-69)\\) which equals 897.\n2. Add 55 to 897, resulting in 952.\n3. Subtract \\(-78\\) (which is equivalent to adding 78) from 952, resulting in 1030.\n4. Finally, add \\(-43\\) (which is equivalent to subtracting 43) to 1030, resulting in 987.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<987>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate 55 + -13 * -69 - -78 + -43.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
