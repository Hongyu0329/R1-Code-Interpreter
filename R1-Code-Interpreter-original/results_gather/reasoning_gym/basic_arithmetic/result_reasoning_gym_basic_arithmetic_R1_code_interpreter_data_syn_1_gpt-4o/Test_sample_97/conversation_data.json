    "To solve the expression \\(812 / 2 + 680 + -770 - 389 \\times 601\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Division**: Calculate \\(812 / 2\\).\n2. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(389 \\times 601\\).\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Division\ndivision_result = 812 / 2\n\n# Step 2: Multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 389 * 601\n\n# Step 3: Addition and Subtraction\nfinal_result = division_result + 680 + (-770) - multiplication_result\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression \\(812 / 2 + 680 + -770 - 389 \\times 601\\).\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n1. \\(812 / 2 = 406\\)\n2. \\(389 \\times 601 = 233689\\)\n3. \\(406 + 680 - 770 - 233689 = -233473\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-233473>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate 812 / 2 + 680 + -770 - 389 * 601.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
