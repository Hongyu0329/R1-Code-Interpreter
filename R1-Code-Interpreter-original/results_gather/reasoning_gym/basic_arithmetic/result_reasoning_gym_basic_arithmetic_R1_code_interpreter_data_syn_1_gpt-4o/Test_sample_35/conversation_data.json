    "To solve the problem of calculating \\((-1) + (-8)\\), we need to perform a simple arithmetic operation of adding two negative numbers. \n\nWhen adding two negative numbers, the result is also negative, and the magnitude of the result is the sum of the magnitudes of the two numbers. \n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of -1 and -8\nresult = -1 + -8\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate ( -1 + -8 ).\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
