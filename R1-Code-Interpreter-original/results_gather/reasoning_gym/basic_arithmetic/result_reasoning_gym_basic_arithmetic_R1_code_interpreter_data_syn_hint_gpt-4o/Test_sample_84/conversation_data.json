    "To solve the expression \\(542 + (-9) + \\frac{-438}{-(953 \\times -340 + -324018)}\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Calculate the expression inside the parentheses**: \n   \\[\n   953 \\times -340 + -324018\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the division**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-438}{\\text{result from step 1}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the addition and subtraction**:\n   \\[\n   542 + (-9) + \\text{result from step 2}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses\nparentheses_result = 953 * -340 + -324018\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the division\ndivision_result = -438 / -parentheses_result\n\n# Step 3: Perform the addition and subtraction\nfinal_result = 542 + (-9) + division_result\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution result provides the final value of the expression, which is approximately 532.9993. This result is obtained by following the order of operations and correctly handling the arithmetic operations, including the division and addition/subtraction.\n\nThe expression was evaluated as follows:\n\n1. **Calculate the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   \\[\n   953 \\times -340 + -324018 = -324018 - 324020 = -648038\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the division**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-438}{648038} \\approx -0.0006758862907\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the addition and subtraction**:\n   \\[\n   542 + (-9) + (-0.0006758862907) \\approx 532.9993241137093\n   \\]\n\nThe final result of the expression is approximately 532.9993.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
