    "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the product of two numbers: \\(-(765 \\times -805)\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Signs**: \n   - The expression involves two negative signs. \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Therefore, \\(-765 \\times -805\\) is equivalent to \\(765 \\times 805\\).\n\n2. **Calculation**:\n   - We need to multiply 765 by 805.\n   - After obtaining the result, we will apply the negative sign to the final product.\n\nLet's calculate the product using Python code for accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of 765 and 805\nproduct = 765 * 805\n\n# Apply the negative sign to the result\nresult = -product\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the calculation was straightforward. The task was to compute \\(-(765 \\times -805)\\), which simplifies to \\(-615825\\) after considering the signs.\n\nThe steps were:\n1. Calculate \\(765 \\times 805\\).\n2. Apply the negative sign to the result.\n\nThe final result is \\(-615825\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-615825<<<answer>>>"
