    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-340 + -683\\), we need to add the two negative numbers together. When adding two negative numbers, the result is also negative, and the magnitude of the result is the sum of the magnitudes of the two numbers.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The first number is \\(-340\\).\n2. The second number is \\(-683\\).\n3. Adding these two numbers together: \\(-340 + -683\\).\n\nThe sum of the magnitudes is \\(340 + 683\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum:\n\n\\[\n340 + 683 = 1023\n\\]\n\nSince both numbers are negative, the result will also be negative:\n\n\\[\n-340 + -683 = -1023\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(-1023\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-1023<<<answer>>>"
