  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-9 + -1 \\times -3 \\times -5 + 4\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, we perform the multiplication \\(-1 \\times -3 \\times -5\\).\n   - \\(-1 \\times -3 = 3\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times -5 = -15\\)\n\n2. **Addition and Subtraction**: Now, substitute the result of the multiplication back into the expression and perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n   - The expression becomes \\(-9 + (-15) + 4\\).\n   - \\(-9 + (-15) = -24\\)\n   - \\(-24 + 4 = -20\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-20\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-20<<<answer>>>"
