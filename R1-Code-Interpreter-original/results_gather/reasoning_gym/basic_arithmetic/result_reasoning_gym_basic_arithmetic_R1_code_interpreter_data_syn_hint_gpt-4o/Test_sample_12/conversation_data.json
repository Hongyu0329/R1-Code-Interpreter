  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(0 + -2 + -4 \\times 0 \\times 3\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   - Calculate \\(-4 \\times 0\\), which equals 0.\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: \\(0 \\times 3 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   - Now, the expression simplifies to \\(0 + -2 + 0\\).\n   - Calculate \\(0 + -2 = -2\\).\n   - Finally, add 0: \\(-2 + 0 = -2\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-2\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-2<<<answer>>>"
