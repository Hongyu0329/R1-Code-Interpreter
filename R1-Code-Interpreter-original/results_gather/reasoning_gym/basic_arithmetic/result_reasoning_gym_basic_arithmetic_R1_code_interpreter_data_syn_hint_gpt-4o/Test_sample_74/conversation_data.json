  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-( -1 + ( 0 * -2 ) / 3 + 6 )\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first: \\(-1 + ( 0 * -2 ) / 3 + 6\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication/Division**: Inside the parentheses, perform the multiplication and division from left to right:\n   - \\(0 * -2 = 0\\)\n   - \\(0 / 3 = 0\\)\n\n3. **Addition/Subtraction**: Now, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n   - \\(-1 + 0 + 6 = 5\\)\n\n4. **Negation**: Finally, apply the negation outside the parentheses:\n   - \\(-5\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-5\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-5<<<answer>>>"
