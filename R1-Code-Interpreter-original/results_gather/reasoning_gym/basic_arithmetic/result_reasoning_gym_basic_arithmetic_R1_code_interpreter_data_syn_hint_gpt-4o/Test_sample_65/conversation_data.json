  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-(8821 + -9457) * -9148\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication.\n\n1. **Calculate the expression inside the parentheses**: \n   \\[\n   8821 + (-9457) = 8821 - 9457\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the subtraction**:\n   \\[\n   8821 - 9457 = -636\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the result by -9148**:\n   \\[\n   -(-636) * -9148 = 636 * 9148\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(636 * 9148\\) using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the multiplication\nresult = 636 * 9148\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final result.",
    "The code execution result provides the multiplication of \\(636\\) and \\(9148\\), which is \\(5818128\\). This confirms the calculation of the expression \\(-(8821 + -9457) * -9148\\).\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n1. Calculate the sum inside the parentheses: \\(8821 + (-9457) = -636\\).\n2. Multiply the result by \\(-9148\\): \\(-(-636) * -9148 = 636 * 9148\\).\n3. The multiplication result is \\(5818128\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<'5818128'>>>"
