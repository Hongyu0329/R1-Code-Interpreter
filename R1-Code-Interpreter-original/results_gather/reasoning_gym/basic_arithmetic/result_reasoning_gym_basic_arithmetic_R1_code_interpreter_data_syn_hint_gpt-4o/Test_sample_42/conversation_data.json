  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(0 + -3 - -6 / (1 * 7 + -6)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have \\(1 * 7 + -6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(1 * 7 = 7\\).\n   - Then, \\(7 + -6 = 1\\).\n\n2. **Division**: Next, perform the division.\n   - The expression now is \\(0 + -3 - -6 / 1\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-6 / 1 = -6\\).\n\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**: Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n   - The expression becomes \\(0 + -3 - (-6)\\).\n   - Calculate \\(0 + -3 = -3\\).\n   - Then, \\(-3 - (-6) = -3 + 6 = 3\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 3.\n\n<<<answer>>>3"
