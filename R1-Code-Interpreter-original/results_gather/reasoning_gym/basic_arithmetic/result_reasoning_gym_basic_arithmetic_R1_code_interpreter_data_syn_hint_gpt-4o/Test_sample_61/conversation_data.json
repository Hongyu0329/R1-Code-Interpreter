    "To solve the expression \\(-811 \\times -750 + 192 + 391 \\times 858\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   - Calculate \\(-811 \\times -750\\).\n   - Calculate \\(391 \\times 858\\).\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   - Add the results of the multiplications and the number 192.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (-811 * -750) + 192 + (391 * 858)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
    "The code execution result provided the output of the expression, which is 943920. This result is obtained by following the order of operations correctly:\n\n1. **Multiplication**:\n   - \\(-811 \\times -750 = 608250\\)\n   - \\(391 \\times 858 = 335478\\)\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   - \\(608250 + 192 + 335478 = 943920\\)\n\nThe calculations were performed correctly, and the result matches the expected outcome. Therefore, the final answer to the expression \\(-811 \\times -750 + 192 + 391 \\times 858\\) is:\n\n<<<'943920'>>>"
