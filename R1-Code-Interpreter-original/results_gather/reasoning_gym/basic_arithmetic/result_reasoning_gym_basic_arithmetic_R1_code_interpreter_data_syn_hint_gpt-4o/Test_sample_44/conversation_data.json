    "To solve the problem of calculating the sum of the numbers -268, 3701, -771, and -4359, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by adding the first two numbers: -268 + 3701.\n2. Then, add the result to the third number: result + (-771).\n3. Finally, add the result to the fourth number: result + (-4359).\n\nLet's perform these calculations step by step:\n\n- First, calculate -268 + 3701.\n- Then, add the result to -771.\n- Finally, add the result to -4359.\n\nWe can use Python code to perform these calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [-268, 3701, -771, -4359]\n\n# Calculate the sum\nresult = sum(numbers)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution result provided the correct sum of the numbers: -268 + 3701 + -771 - 4359, which is -1697. The calculation was straightforward, and the code correctly computed the sum of the list of numbers.\n\nSince the task was to calculate a simple arithmetic sum, the code was appropriate for the task, and the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<answer>>> -1697"
