  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-(2 - 7 + 5 \\times 0 - 4) / 1\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\(2 - 7 + 5 \\times 0 - 4\\).\n   - Inside the parentheses, handle the multiplication first: \\(5 \\times 0 = 0\\).\n   - Now the expression inside the parentheses becomes: \\(2 - 7 + 0 - 4\\).\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     - \\(2 - 7 = -5\\)\n     - \\(-5 + 0 = -5\\)\n     - \\(-5 - 4 = -9\\)\n\n2. **Division**: Now, divide the result by 1: \\(-9 / 1 = -9\\).\n\n3. **Negation**: Finally, apply the negation to the result: \\(-(-9) = 9\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 9.\n\n<<<answer>>>9"
