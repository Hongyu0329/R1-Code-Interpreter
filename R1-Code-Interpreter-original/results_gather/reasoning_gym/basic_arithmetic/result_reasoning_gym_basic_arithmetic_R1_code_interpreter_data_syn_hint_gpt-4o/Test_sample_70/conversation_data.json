    "To solve the expression \\(136 - (-121) \\times 191\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves subtraction and multiplication.\n2. **Handle the negative sign**: The expression \\( -(-121) \\) becomes \\( +121 \\).\n3. **Perform the multiplication**: Calculate \\( 121 \\times 191 \\).\n4. **Perform the subtraction**: Subtract the result of the multiplication from 136.\n\nLet's calculate the multiplication first:\n\n\\[ 121 \\times 191 \\]\n\nNow, let's perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 121 * 191\n\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = 136 + multiplication_result\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final result.",
    "The code execution result provided the output of the calculation, which is 23247. This result is obtained by following the order of operations correctly:\n\n1. The expression \\(136 - (-121) \\times 191\\) simplifies to \\(136 + 121 \\times 191\\).\n2. The multiplication \\(121 \\times 191\\) is calculated first, resulting in 23111.\n3. Finally, adding 136 to 23111 gives the final result of 23247.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<'23247'>>>"
