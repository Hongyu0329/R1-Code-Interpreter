    "To solve the problem of calculating \\((-1) + (-8)\\), we need to understand that both numbers are negative. When adding two negative numbers, the result is also negative, and the magnitude of the result is the sum of the magnitudes of the two numbers.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the numbers: \\(-1\\) and \\(-8\\).\n2. Both numbers are negative.\n3. Add the magnitudes: \\(1 + 8 = 9\\).\n4. Since both numbers are negative, the result is also negative.\n\nTherefore, \\((-1) + (-8) = -9\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-9<<<answer>>>"
