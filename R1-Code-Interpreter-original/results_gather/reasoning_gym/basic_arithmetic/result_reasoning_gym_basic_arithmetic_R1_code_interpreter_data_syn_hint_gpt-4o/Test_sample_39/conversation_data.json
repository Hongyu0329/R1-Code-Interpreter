    "To solve the expression \\(-( -1 + 7 + 7 ) + 5\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then addition/subtraction from left to right.\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: \\(-1 + 7 + 7\\).\n2. Simplify the expression: \\(-1 + 7 = 6\\), then \\(6 + 7 = 13\\).\n3. Now, the expression becomes \\(-(13) + 5\\).\n4. Simplify further: \\(-13 + 5 = -8\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-8\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-8<<<answer>>>"
