    "To solve the expression \\(6 - 8 + 6 - (-8)\\), we need to follow the order of operations and simplify step by step:\n\n1. Start with the expression: \\(6 - 8 + 6 - (-8)\\).\n2. Simplify the double negative: \\(-(-8)\\) becomes \\(+8\\).\n3. The expression now is: \\(6 - 8 + 6 + 8\\).\n4. Perform the operations from left to right:\n   - \\(6 - 8 = -2\\)\n   - \\(-2 + 6 = 4\\)\n   - \\(4 + 8 = 12\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 12.\n\n<<<answer>>>12<<<answer>>>"
