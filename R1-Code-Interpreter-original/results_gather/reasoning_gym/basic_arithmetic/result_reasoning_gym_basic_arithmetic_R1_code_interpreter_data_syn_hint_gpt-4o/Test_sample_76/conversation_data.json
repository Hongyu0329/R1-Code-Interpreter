    "To solve the expression \\(-1 - (-3) + 0\\), we need to follow the order of operations and simplify the expression step by step.\n\n1. **Simplify the double negative**: The expression \\(-1 - (-3)\\) can be simplified by recognizing that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive of that number. Therefore, \\(-1 - (-3)\\) becomes \\(-1 + 3\\).\n\n2. **Perform the addition**: Now, we calculate \\(-1 + 3\\), which equals \\(2\\).\n\n3. **Add zero**: Finally, we add \\(0\\) to the result. Since adding zero does not change the value, the final result remains \\(2\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression \\(-1 - (-3) + 0\\) is \\(2\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>2"
