    "To solve the expression \\(-29 - 67 \\times 36 + 67 \\times 29 - 76\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). \n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   - Calculate \\(67 \\times 36\\)\n   - Calculate \\(67 \\times 29\\)\n\n2. **Substitution**: \n   - Substitute the results of the multiplications back into the expression.\n\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**: \n   - Perform the operations from left to right.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the multiplications\nmult1 = 67 * 36\nmult2 = 67 * 29\n\n# Step 2: Substitute and calculate the final expression\nresult = -29 - mult1 + mult2 - 76\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code execution result of \\(-574\\) is correct. Let's verify the steps to ensure the accuracy of the calculation:\n\n1. **Multiplication**:\n   - \\(67 \\times 36 = 2412\\)\n   - \\(67 \\times 29 = 1943\\)\n\n2. **Substitution and Calculation**:\n   - Substitute these values back into the expression: \\(-29 - 2412 + 1943 - 76\\)\n   - Simplify step by step:\n     - \\(-29 - 2412 = -2441\\)\n     - \\(-2441 + 1943 = -498\\)\n     - \\(-498 - 76 = -574\\)\n\nThe final result of the expression is \\(-574\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'-574'>>>"
