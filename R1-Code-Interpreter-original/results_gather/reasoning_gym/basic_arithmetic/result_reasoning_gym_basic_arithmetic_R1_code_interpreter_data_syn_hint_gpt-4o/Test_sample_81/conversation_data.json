    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-20 \\times -106\\), we need to understand the rules of multiplication involving negative numbers. \n\nWhen two negative numbers are multiplied together, the result is a positive number. This is because the negative signs cancel each other out. Therefore, the product of \\(-20\\) and \\(-106\\) will be positive.\n\nNow, let's calculate the product:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 106 = 2120\n\\]\n\nSince both numbers are negative, the result will be positive:\n\n\\[\n-20 \\times -106 = 2120\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2120>>>"
