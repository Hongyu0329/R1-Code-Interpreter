    "To solve the expression \\(( ( 1 \\times 9 + -8 \\times 8 ) ) - -( ( 8 - -4 ) )\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - First, calculate the multiplication inside the first set of parentheses:\n     - \\(1 \\times 9 = 9\\)\n     - \\(-8 \\times 8 = -64\\)\n   - Then, add the results of these multiplications:\n     - \\(9 + (-64) = 9 - 64 = -55\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**:\n   - Calculate the expression inside the parentheses:\n     - \\(8 - (-4) = 8 + 4 = 12\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - The expression becomes \\(-55 - (-12)\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive:\n     - \\(-55 + 12 = -43\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-43\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-43"
