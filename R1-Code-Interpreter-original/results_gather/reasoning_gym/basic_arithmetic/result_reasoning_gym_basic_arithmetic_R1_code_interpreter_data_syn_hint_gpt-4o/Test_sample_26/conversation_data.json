    "To solve the expression \\(-( -89 - 4 ) * ( ( -96 / 48 ) / 1 ) / 2\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: \n   - Inside the first parentheses: \\(-89 - 4 = -93\\).\n   - Inside the second parentheses: \\(-96 / 48 = -2\\).\n\n2. **Negation**: \n   - The expression becomes \\(-(-93) * (-2 / 1) / 2\\).\n\n3. **Simplify**:\n   - \\(-(-93)\\) becomes \\(93\\).\n   - \\(-2 / 1\\) simplifies to \\(-2\\).\n\n4. **Multiplication and Division**:\n   - \\(93 * (-2) = -186\\).\n   - \\(-186 / 2 = -93\\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = -(-89 - 4) * ((-96 / 48) / 1) / 2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is \\(-93.0\\). The steps followed in the reasoning process were correct, and the code verified the result accurately.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(-( -89 - 4 ) * ( ( -96 / 48 ) / 1 ) / 2\\) is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> -93.0"
