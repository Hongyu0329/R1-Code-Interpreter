    "To solve the expression \\(-146 \\times 663 - 430\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which dictates that multiplication should be performed before subtraction.\n\n1. First, calculate the multiplication: \\(-146 \\times 663\\).\n2. Then, subtract 430 from the result of the multiplication.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = -146 * 663 - 430\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code execution result provided the output of the expression \\(-146 \\times 663 - 430\\) as \\(-97228\\). This result is consistent with the arithmetic operations performed:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-146\\) by \\(663\\):\n   \\[\n   -146 \\times 663 = -96858\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\(430\\) from \\(-96858\\):\n   \\[\n   -96858 - 430 = -97228\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct, and the final result of the expression is \\(-97228\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-97228<<<answer>>>"
