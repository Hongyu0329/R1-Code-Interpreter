    "To solve the expression \\(-96 \\times -78 \\times -29 + -88 - -7 \\times -4\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   - Calculate \\(-96 \\times -78 \\times -29\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-7 \\times -4\\).\n\n2. **Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - Add the result of the multiplication to \\(-88\\).\n   - Subtract the result of the second multiplication.\n\nLet's calculate these step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = (-96 * -78 * -29) + (-88) - (-7 * -4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the calculation was performed correctly, and the result is \\(-217268\\). \n\nLet's break down the calculation to ensure everything is clear:\n\n1. **Multiplication**:\n   - \\(-96 \\times -78 = 7488\\)\n   - \\(7488 \\times -29 = -217152\\)\n\n2. **Second Multiplication**:\n   - \\(-7 \\times -4 = 28\\)\n\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - \\(-217152 + (-88) = -217240\\)\n   - \\(-217240 - 28 = -217268\\)\n\nThe calculations confirm that the result of the expression is \\(-217268\\).\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
