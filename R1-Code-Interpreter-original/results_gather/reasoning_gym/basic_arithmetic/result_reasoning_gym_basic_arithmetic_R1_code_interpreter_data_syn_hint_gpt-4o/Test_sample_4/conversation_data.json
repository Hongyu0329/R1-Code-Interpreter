    "To solve the expression \\(0 + 7 - \\frac{-1}{1}\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Division**: First, we perform the division \\(\\frac{-1}{1}\\), which equals \\(-1\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction**: Next, we substitute the result of the division back into the expression: \\(0 + 7 - (-1)\\).\n\n3. **Handling Negative Sign**: Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart. Therefore, \\(7 - (-1)\\) becomes \\(7 + 1\\).\n\n4. **Addition**: Finally, we perform the addition: \\(0 + 7 + 1\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step:\n\n- \\(0 + 7 = 7\\)\n- \\(7 + 1 = 8\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 8.\n\n<<<answer>>>8"
