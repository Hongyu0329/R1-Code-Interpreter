    "To solve the expression \\(-( 87 \\times 72 \\times 52 - \\frac{-22}{22} ) / 325729\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Calculate inside the parentheses**:\n   - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(87 \\times 72 \\times 52\\).\n   - Then, calculate the division: \\(\\frac{-22}{22}\\).\n   - Subtract the result of the division from the result of the multiplication.\n\n2. **Negate the result**: Multiply the result from step 1 by -1.\n\n3. **Divide by 325729**: Take the result from step 2 and divide it by 325729.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate inside the parentheses\nmultiplication_result = 87 * 72 * 52\ndivision_result = -22 / 22\nparentheses_result = multiplication_result - division_result\n\n# Step 2: Negate the result\nnegated_result = -parentheses_result\n\n# Step 3: Divide by 325729\nfinal_result = negated_result / 325729\n\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the calculation was performed correctly, and the result is \\(-1.0\\). This matches the expected outcome based on the mathematical operations described.\n\nTo summarize the steps and confirm the result:\n1. **Multiplication**: \\(87 \\times 72 \\times 52 = 325728\\).\n2. **Division**: \\(\\frac{-22}{22} = -1\\).\n3. **Subtraction inside parentheses**: \\(325728 - (-1) = 325728 + 1 = 325729\\).\n4. **Negation**: \\(-325729\\).\n5. **Division by 325729**: \\(-325729 / 325729 = -1.0\\).\n\nThe final result of the expression is \\(-1.0\\).\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
