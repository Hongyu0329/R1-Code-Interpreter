    "To solve the expression \\(94 - 66 \\times 81\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, we perform the multiplication operation in the expression.\n   \\[\n   66 \\times 81\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtraction**: After calculating the multiplication, we subtract the result from 94.\n\nLet's calculate the multiplication first:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression 94 - 66 * 81\nresult = 94 - 66 * 81\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code execution result is \\(-5252\\), which is the correct result for the expression \\(94 - 66 \\times 81\\). \n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   \\[\n   66 \\times 81 = 5346\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtraction**:\n   \\[\n   94 - 5346 = -5252\n   \\]\n\nThe calculation follows the order of operations correctly, and the result is \\(-5252\\).\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
