    "To solve the expression \\(-85 + (-41) \\times 28 - 45\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, we perform the multiplication \\((-41) \\times 28\\).\n2. **Addition and Subtraction**: Then, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n- Calculate \\((-41) \\times 28\\).\n- Add the result to \\(-85\\).\n- Subtract 45 from the result.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculation\nresult = -85 + (-41) * 28 - 45\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final result.",
    "The code execution result of \\(-1278\\) is correct for the expression \\(-85 + (-41) \\times 28 - 45\\). Let's break down the calculation to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   \\[\n   (-41) \\times 28 = -1148\n   \\]\n\n2. **Addition and Subtraction**:\n   \\[\n   -85 + (-1148) = -1233\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -1233 - 45 = -1278\n   \\]\n\nThe calculation steps confirm that the result is indeed \\(-1278\\). Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
