    "To solve the expression \\(10 \\times -37 + -35 - -46\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, calculate \\(10 \\times -37\\).\n2. **Addition/Subtraction**: Then, add and subtract the remaining numbers in the expression.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\(10 \\times -37\\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\times -37 = -370\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   -370 + -35 - -46\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the expression:\n   - First, handle the subtraction of a negative, which is equivalent to addition:\n     \\[\n     -370 + -35 + 46\n     \\]\n\n4. Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   - Add \\(-370\\) and \\(-35\\):\n     \\[\n     -370 + -35 = -405\n     \\]\n   - Add \\(-405\\) and \\(46\\):\n     \\[\n     -405 + 46 = -359\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-359\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-359<<<answer>>>"
