  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-( ( 4 + -9 * 8 ) + 9 )\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Start by solving the expression inside the innermost parentheses.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have \\(4 + (-9 \\times 8)\\).\n   \n2. **Multiplication**: Perform the multiplication inside the parentheses.\n   - \\(-9 \\times 8 = -72\\).\n\n3. **Addition**: Now, add the result to 4.\n   - \\(4 + (-72) = 4 - 72 = -68\\).\n\n4. **Outer Parentheses**: Now, we have \\(-(-68 + 9)\\).\n   - First, solve the addition inside the parentheses: \\(-68 + 9 = -59\\).\n\n5. **Negation**: Finally, apply the negation to the result.\n   - \\(-(-59) = 59\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 59.\n\n<<<answer>>>59"
