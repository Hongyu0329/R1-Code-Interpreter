  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-3 + 2 \\times -9 \\times -5 + -3\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, we perform the multiplication operations.\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times -9 = -18\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(-18 \\times -5 = 90\\).\n\n2. **Addition and Subtraction**: Next, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n   - Start with \\(-3 + 90 = 87\\).\n   - Finally, add \\(-3\\) to \\(87\\), which gives \\(87 - 3 = 84\\).\n\nThus, the result of the expression is 84.\n\n<<<answer>>>84<<<answer>>>"
