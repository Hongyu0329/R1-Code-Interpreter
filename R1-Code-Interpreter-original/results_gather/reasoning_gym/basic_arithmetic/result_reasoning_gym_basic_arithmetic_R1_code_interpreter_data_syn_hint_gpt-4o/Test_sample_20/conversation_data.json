    "To solve the expression \\(-5 - -(( -2 + -4 )) - -2\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: \\(-2 + -4\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(-6\\).\n\n2. Substitute back into the expression: \\(-5 - -(-6) - -2\\).\n\n3. Simplify the double negative: \\(-(-6)\\) becomes \\(6\\).\n\n4. Substitute back into the expression: \\(-5 - 6 - -2\\).\n\n5. Simplify the next double negative: \\(-(-2)\\) becomes \\(2\\).\n\n6. Substitute back into the expression: \\(-5 - 6 + 2\\).\n\n7. Perform the operations from left to right:\n   - \\(-5 - 6\\) equals \\(-11\\).\n   - \\(-11 + 2\\) equals \\(-9\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-9\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-9<<<answer>>>"
