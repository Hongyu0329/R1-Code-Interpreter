    "To solve the expression \\(55 + (-13) \\times (-69) - (-78) + (-43)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, we calculate the multiplication part of the expression:\n   \\[\n   (-13) \\times (-69) = 897\n   \\]\n   Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n\n2. **Substitution**: Substitute the result back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   55 + 897 - (-78) + (-43)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify**: Simplify the expression by handling the subtraction of a negative number, which is equivalent to addition:\n   \\[\n   55 + 897 + 78 - 43\n   \\]\n\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   - First, add 55 and 897:\n     \\[\n     55 + 897 = 952\n     \\]\n   - Then, add 78:\n     \\[\n     952 + 78 = 1030\n     \\]\n   - Finally, subtract 43:\n     \\[\n     1030 - 43 = 987\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 987.\n\n<<<answer>>>987<<<answer>>>"
