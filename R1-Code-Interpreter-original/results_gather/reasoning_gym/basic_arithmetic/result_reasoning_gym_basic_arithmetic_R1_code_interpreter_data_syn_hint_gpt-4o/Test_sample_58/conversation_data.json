    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( -1 - -7 ) ) - 3\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then negations, and finally subtraction.\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**: \n   - The expression inside the parentheses is \\(-1 - -7\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(-1 - -7\\) becomes \\(-1 + 7\\).\n   - \\(-1 + 7 = 6\\).\n\n2. **Apply the first negation**: \n   - The expression becomes \\(-(6)\\), which is \\(-6\\).\n\n3. **Apply the second negation**: \n   - The expression becomes \\(-(-6)\\), which is \\(6\\).\n\n4. **Subtract 3**: \n   - Finally, we have \\(6 - 3\\).\n   - \\(6 - 3 = 3\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 3.\n\n<<<answer>>>3"
