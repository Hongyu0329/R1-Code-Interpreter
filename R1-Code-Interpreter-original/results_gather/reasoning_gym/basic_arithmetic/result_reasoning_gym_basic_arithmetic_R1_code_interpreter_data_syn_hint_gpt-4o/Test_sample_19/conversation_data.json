    "To solve the expression \\(-40 \\times ( (-98) + (-92) )\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\((-98) + (-92)\\).\n2. **Addition inside Parentheses**: \\(-98 + (-92) = -190\\).\n3. **Multiplication**: Now, multiply the result by \\(-40\\): \\(-40 \\times (-190)\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = -40 * ((-98) + (-92))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and there are no errors. The calculation was straightforward, involving basic arithmetic operations. The steps were:\n\n1. Calculate the sum inside the parentheses: \\((-98) + (-92) = -190\\).\n2. Multiply the result by \\(-40\\): \\(-40 \\times (-190) = 7600\\).\n\nThe final result of the expression \\(-40 \\times ( (-98) + (-92) )\\) is 7600.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
