    "To solve the expression \\(655 - (-43) \\times 623 + (-684)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, we calculate \\(-43 \\times 623\\).\n2. **Subtraction and Addition**: Then, we substitute the result back into the expression and perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the multiplication\nmultiplication_result = -43 * 623\n\n# Step 2: Substitute back into the expression and calculate the final result\nfinal_result = 655 - multiplication_result + (-684)\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution result of 26760 is correct for the given expression. Let's break down the steps to ensure the accuracy of the calculation:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   \\[\n   -43 \\times 623 = -26789\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitution and Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   655 - (-26789) + (-684) = 655 + 26789 - 684\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   655 + 26789 = 27444\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   27444 - 684 = 26760\n   \\]\n\nThe final result of the expression \\(655 - (-43) \\times 623 + (-684)\\) is indeed 26760.\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 26760"
