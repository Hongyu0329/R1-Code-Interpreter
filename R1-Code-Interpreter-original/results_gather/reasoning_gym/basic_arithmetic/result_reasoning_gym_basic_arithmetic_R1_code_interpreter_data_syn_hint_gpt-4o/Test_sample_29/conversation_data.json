    "To solve the expression \\(-17 - (-17) \\times (-92) - (-8) - (-83)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Identify and simplify the negative signs**: \n   - \\(-(-17)\\) becomes \\(+17\\)\n   - \\(-(-8)\\) becomes \\(+8\\)\n   - \\(-(-83)\\) becomes \\(+83\\)\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - \\((-17) \\times (-92)\\) becomes \\(+1564\\) because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n\n3. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - The expression becomes \\(-17 + 1564 + 8 + 83\\).\n\n4. **Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right**:\n   - \\(-17 + 1564 = 1547\\)\n   - \\(1547 + 8 = 1555\\)\n   - \\(1555 + 83 = 1638\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 1638.\n\n<<<answer>>>1638<<<answer>>>"
