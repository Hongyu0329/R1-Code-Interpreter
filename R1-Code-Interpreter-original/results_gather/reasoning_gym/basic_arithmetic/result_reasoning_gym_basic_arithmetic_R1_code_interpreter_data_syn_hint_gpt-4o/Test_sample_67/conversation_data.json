    "To solve the expression \\((-7162 \\times 7394) + (3817 \\times 9281) + 2255\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is multiplication before addition.\n\n1. First, calculate the product of \\(-7162\\) and \\(7394\\).\n2. Then, calculate the product of \\(3817\\) and \\(9281\\).\n3. Add the results of the two multiplications.\n4. Finally, add \\(2255\\) to the result from step 3.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code for accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (-7162 * 7394) + (3817 * 9281) + 2255\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code execution result provided the output of the expression as \\(-17527996\\). This result is obtained by following the order of operations correctly and performing the calculations step by step.\n\nLet's break down the steps to ensure the accuracy of the result:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(-7162 \\times 7394\\):**\n   - This is a multiplication of two negative numbers, which results in a negative product.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(3817 \\times 9281\\):**\n   - This is a multiplication of two positive numbers, resulting in a positive product.\n\n3. **Add the results of the two multiplications:**\n   - The sum of a negative and a positive number will depend on their magnitudes.\n\n4. **Add \\(2255\\) to the result from step 3:**\n   - This is a simple addition to the result obtained from the previous step.\n\nThe code correctly computes these steps, and the final result is \\(-17527996\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> -17527996"
