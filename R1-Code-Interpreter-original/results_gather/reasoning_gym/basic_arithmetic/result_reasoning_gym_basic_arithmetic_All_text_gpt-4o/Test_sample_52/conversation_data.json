  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(1 + 5 - 8 \\times 2\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify operations**: The expression contains addition (+), subtraction (-), and multiplication (*).\n\n2. **Order of operations**: According to PEMDAS, we perform multiplication before addition and subtraction.\n\n3. **Perform multiplication**: \n   - The multiplication in the expression is \\(8 \\times 2\\).\n   - Calculate \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\).\n\n4. **Rewrite the expression**: After performing the multiplication, the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   1 + 5 - 16\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**:\n   - First, perform the addition: \\(1 + 5 = 6\\).\n   - Next, perform the subtraction: \\(6 - 16 = -10\\).\n\n6. **Final result**: The result of the expression \\(1 + 5 - 8 \\times 2\\) is \\(-10\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-10>>>"
