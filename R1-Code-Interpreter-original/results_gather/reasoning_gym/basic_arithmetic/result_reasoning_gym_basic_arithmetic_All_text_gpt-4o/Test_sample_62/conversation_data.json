    "To solve the expression \\(-28 * -(((91 / 7) / 13) - 6) / 1\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the innermost expression: \\(91 / 7\\)**\n   - \\(91\\) divided by \\(7\\) equals \\(13\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression: \\((13 / 13) - 6\\)**\n   - \\(13\\) divided by \\(13\\) equals \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Substitute the result back into the expression: \\(1 - 6\\)**\n   - \\(1\\) minus \\(6\\) equals \\(-5\\).\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression: \\(-28 * -(-5) / 1\\)**\n   - The negative sign in front of \\(-5\\) makes it positive, so it becomes \\(5\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(-28 * 5\\)**\n   - \\(-28\\) multiplied by \\(5\\) equals \\(-140\\).\n\n6. **Divide by 1: \\(-140 / 1\\)**\n   - \\(-140\\) divided by \\(1\\) equals \\(-140\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-140>>>"
