  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-1 - (-3) + 0\\), we need to carefully analyze each part of the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operation**: The expression involves subtraction and addition. The operations are:\n   - Subtraction of \\(-3\\) from \\(-1\\).\n   - Addition of \\(0\\) to the result.\n\n2. **Handle double negatives**: The expression \\(-1 - (-3)\\) involves a double negative. Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive of that number. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   -1 - (-3) = -1 + 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the addition**: Now, calculate \\(-1 + 3\\):\n   - Start from \\(-1\\) on the number line.\n   - Move 3 units to the right (since we are adding 3).\n   - This results in \\(2\\).\n\n4. **Add zero**: The next step is to add \\(0\\) to the result:\n   \\[\n   2 + 0 = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final result**: The final result of the expression \\(-1 - (-3) + 0\\) is \\(2\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
