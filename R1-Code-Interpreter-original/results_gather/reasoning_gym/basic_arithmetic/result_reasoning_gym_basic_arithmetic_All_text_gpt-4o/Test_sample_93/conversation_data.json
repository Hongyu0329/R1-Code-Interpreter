    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(89 + (-10) + 56\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers and Operations:**\n   - We have three numbers: 89, -10, and 56.\n   - The operations involved are addition and subtraction (since adding a negative number is equivalent to subtraction).\n\n2. **Perform the First Operation:**\n   - Start with the first two numbers: 89 and -10.\n   - Calculate \\(89 + (-10)\\).\n   - Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting the positive equivalent of that number.\n   - Therefore, \\(89 + (-10) = 89 - 10\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Result of the First Operation:**\n   - Subtract 10 from 89.\n   - \\(89 - 10 = 79\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Second Operation:**\n   - Now, take the result from the first operation, which is 79, and add the third number, 56.\n   - Calculate \\(79 + 56\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Result of the Second Operation:**\n   - Add 56 to 79.\n   - \\(79 + 56 = 135\\).\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The result of the entire expression \\(89 + (-10) + 56\\) is 135.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that each part of the calculation is handled correctly and systematically.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<135>>>"
