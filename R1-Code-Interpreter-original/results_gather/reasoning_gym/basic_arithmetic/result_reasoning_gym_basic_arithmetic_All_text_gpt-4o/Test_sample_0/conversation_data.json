    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-22 - (-93)\\), we need to carefully analyze each component of the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Operation**: The expression involves subtraction of a negative number. The operation is \\(-22 - (-93)\\).\n\n2. **Understanding Subtraction of a Negative Number**: Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart. This is because subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Therefore, \\(-22 - (-93)\\) can be rewritten as \\(-22 + 93\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Addition**: Now, we need to add \\(-22\\) and \\(93\\).\n\n   - Start from \\(-22\\) and move towards the positive direction by \\(93\\) units.\n   - Adding \\(93\\) to \\(-22\\) can be visualized on a number line or calculated directly:\n     - \\(-22 + 93\\) is the same as \\(93 - 22\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Result**: Perform the subtraction:\n   - \\(93 - 22 = 71\\).\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy:\n   - Start from \\(93\\), subtract \\(22\\), and confirm the result is \\(71\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the result of the expression.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<71>>>"
