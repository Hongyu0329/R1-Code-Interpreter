    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( 3 - 3 ) ) + -4\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**:  \n   The innermost expression is \\(3 - 3\\).  \n   \\[\n   3 - 3 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the first negation**:  \n   The expression now becomes \\(-(0)\\).  \n   \\[\n   -(0) = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the second negation**:  \n   The expression now becomes \\(-(0)\\).  \n   \\[\n   -(0) = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add \\(-4\\) to the result**:  \n   The expression now becomes \\(0 + -4\\).  \n   \\[\n   0 + -4 = -4\n   \\]\n\nAfter evaluating each step carefully, the final result of the expression is \\(-4\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-4>>>"
