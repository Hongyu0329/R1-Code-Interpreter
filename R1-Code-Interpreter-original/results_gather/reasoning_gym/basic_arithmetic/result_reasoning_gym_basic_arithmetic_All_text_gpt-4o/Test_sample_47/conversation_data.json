    "To solve the expression \\((1499 + -3428) + 128\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   - The expression consists of two main parts: \\(1499 + -3428\\) and then adding \\(128\\) to the result of the first part.\n\n2. **Calculate the First Part: \\(1499 + -3428\\):**\n   - This is equivalent to \\(1499 - 3428\\).\n   - Since \\(3428\\) is greater than \\(1499\\), the result will be negative.\n   - Subtract \\(1499\\) from \\(3428\\):\n     \\[\n     3428 - 1499 = 1929\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\(1499 + -3428 = -1929\\).\n\n3. **Add \\(128\\) to the Result of the First Part:**\n   - Now, we need to calculate \\(-1929 + 128\\).\n   - Since \\(-1929\\) is negative and \\(128\\) is positive, we are effectively reducing the magnitude of the negative number.\n   - Subtract \\(128\\) from \\(1929\\):\n     \\[\n     1929 - 128 = 1801\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\(-1929 + 128 = -1801\\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\((1499 + -3428) + 128\\) is \\(-1801\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1801>>>"
