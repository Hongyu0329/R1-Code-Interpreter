    "To solve the expression \\(-(6 / 3) * 9\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. **Parentheses/Brackets**: \n   - The expression inside the parentheses is \\(6 / 3\\).\n   - Calculate \\(6 / 3\\): \n     - \\(6\\) divided by \\(3\\) equals \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-2 * 9\\).\n\n3. **Multiplication**:\n   - Multiply \\(-2\\) by \\(9\\):\n     - \\(-2 * 9 = -18\\).\n\n4. **Final Result**:\n   - The final result of the expression \\(-(6 / 3) * 9\\) is \\(-18\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<-18>>>"
