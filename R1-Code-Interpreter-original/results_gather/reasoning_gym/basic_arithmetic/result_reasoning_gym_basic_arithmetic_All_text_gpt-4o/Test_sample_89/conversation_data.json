    "To calculate \\((-15) \\times 64\\), we can break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps. Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Sign of the Result**:\n   - We are multiplying a negative number by a positive number.\n   - The rule for multiplication is: a negative number times a positive number results in a negative number.\n\n2. **Multiply the Absolute Values**:\n   - Ignore the signs for a moment and multiply the absolute values of the numbers.\n   - The absolute value of \\(-15\\) is \\(15\\).\n   - The absolute value of \\(64\\) is \\(64\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(15 \\times 64\\).\n   - Break it down further if needed:\n     - \\(15 \\times 64\\) can be split into:\n       - \\(15 \\times 60\\) and \\(15 \\times 4\\).\n     - Calculate each part:\n       - \\(15 \\times 60 = 900\\)\n       - \\(15 \\times 4 = 60\\)\n     - Add the results of these two calculations:\n       - \\(900 + 60 = 960\\)\n\n4. **Apply the Sign**:\n   - Since the original multiplication involved a negative number, the result will be negative.\n   - Therefore, \\((-15) \\times 64 = -960\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we have carefully considered the sign and performed the multiplication correctly.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-960>>>"
