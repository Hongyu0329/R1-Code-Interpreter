    "To solve the expression \\((-7162 \\times 7394) + 3817 \\times 9281 + 2255\\), we will break it down into smaller parts and calculate each step carefully.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(-7162 \\times 7394\\):**\n   - First, multiply 7162 by 7394.\n   - Then, apply the negative sign to the result.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(3817 \\times 9281\\):**\n   - Multiply 3817 by 9281.\n\n3. **Add the results from steps 1 and 2, and then add 2255:**\n   - Add the result from step 1 to the result from step 2.\n   - Finally, add 2255 to the sum obtained in the previous step.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(-7162 \\times 7394\\):**\n   - \\(7162 \\times 7394 = 529,276,228\\)\n   - Applying the negative sign: \\(-529,276,228\\)\n\n2. **Calculate \\(3817 \\times 9281\\):**\n   - \\(3817 \\times 9281 = 35,419,177\\)\n\n3. **Add the results and 2255:**\n   - \\(-529,276,228 + 35,419,177 = -493,857,051\\)\n   - \\(-493,857,051 + 2255 = -493,854,796\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-493854796>>>"
