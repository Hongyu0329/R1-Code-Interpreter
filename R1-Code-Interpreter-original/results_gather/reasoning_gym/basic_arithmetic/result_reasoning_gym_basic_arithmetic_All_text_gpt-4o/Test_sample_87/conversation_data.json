    "To solve the expression \\(10 \\times -37 + -35 - -46\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   - First, calculate the multiplication part of the expression: \n     \\[\n     10 \\times -37 = -370\n     \\]\n\n2. **Subtraction and Addition**:\n   - Now, substitute the result of the multiplication back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     -370 + -35 - -46\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the double negative in the expression:\n     \\[\n     -370 + -35 + 46\n     \\]\n\n3. **Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - First, add \\(-370\\) and \\(-35\\):\n       \\[\n       -370 + (-35) = -405\n       \\]\n     - Then, add \\(-405\\) and \\(46\\):\n       \\[\n       -405 + 46 = -359\n       \\]\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression \\(10 \\times -37 + -35 - -46\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-359}\n\\]\n\nOutput in the required format:\n\n<<<-359>>>"
