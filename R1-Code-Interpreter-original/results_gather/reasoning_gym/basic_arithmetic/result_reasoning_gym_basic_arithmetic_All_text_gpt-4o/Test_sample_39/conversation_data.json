    "To solve the expression \\(-( -1 + 7 + 7 ) + 5\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**: \n   - Inside the parentheses, we have \\(-1 + 7 + 7\\).\n   - First, add \\(-1\\) and \\(7\\): \n     \\[\n     -1 + 7 = 6\n     \\]\n   - Next, add the result to the remaining \\(7\\):\n     \\[\n     6 + 7 = 13\n     \\]\n   - So, the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to \\(13\\).\n\n2. **Apply the negative sign outside the parentheses**:\n   - The expression becomes \\(-13\\) because we have a negative sign outside the parentheses.\n\n3. **Add 5 to the result**:\n   - Now, we need to add \\(5\\) to \\(-13\\):\n     \\[\n     -13 + 5 = -8\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-8\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<-8>>>"
