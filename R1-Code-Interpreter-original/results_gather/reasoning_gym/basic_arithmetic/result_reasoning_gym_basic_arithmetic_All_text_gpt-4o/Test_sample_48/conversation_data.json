    "To solve the expression \\( 7459 - 2279 + 8026 - -2790 \\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves subtraction and addition. Note that there is a double negative in the last term, which will affect the operation.\n\n2. **Simplify the double negative**: The expression \\( - -2790 \\) is equivalent to \\( +2790 \\). This is because subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive equivalent of that number.\n\n3. **Rewrite the expression**: With the double negative simplified, the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   7459 - 2279 + 8026 + 2790\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the operations step by step**:\n\n   - **First operation**: Subtract 2279 from 7459.\n     \\[\n     7459 - 2279 = 5180\n     \\]\n\n   - **Second operation**: Add 8026 to the result from the first operation.\n     \\[\n     5180 + 8026 = 13206\n     \\]\n\n   - **Third operation**: Add 2790 to the result from the second operation.\n     \\[\n     13206 + 2790 = 15996\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final result**: The final result of the expression is 15996.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the expression \\( 7459 - 2279 + 8026 - -2790 \\) is:\n\n<<<15996>>>"
