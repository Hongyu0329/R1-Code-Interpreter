    "To calculate \\(-9 \\times 4\\), we can break down the problem into a series of steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply a negative number, \\(-9\\), by a positive number, \\(4\\).\n\n2. **Sign Determination**: \n   - When multiplying a negative number by a positive number, the result is negative. \n   - Therefore, the product of \\(-9\\) and \\(4\\) will be negative.\n\n3. **Absolute Value Multiplication**:\n   - Ignore the signs and multiply the absolute values of the numbers.\n   - The absolute value of \\(-9\\) is \\(9\\).\n   - The absolute value of \\(4\\) is \\(4\\).\n   - Multiply these absolute values: \\(9 \\times 4 = 36\\).\n\n4. **Apply the Sign**:\n   - Since we determined that the result should be negative, apply the negative sign to the product obtained from the absolute values.\n   - Therefore, the result is \\(-36\\).\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final result of \\(-9 \\times 4\\) is \\(-36\\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<-36>>>"
