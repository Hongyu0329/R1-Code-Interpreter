    "To solve the expression \\(-5802 / 6 + -8389 - -4303 * -8210\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Division**: \n   - Calculate \\(-5802 / 6\\).\n   - \\(-5802 / 6 = -967\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(-4303 * -8210\\).\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - \\(-4303 * -8210 = 35318630\\).\n\n3. **Subtraction and Addition**:\n   - Now substitute the results back into the expression: \\(-967 + -8389 - 35318630\\).\n   - First, perform the addition/subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-967 + -8389 = -9356\\).\n     - \\(-9356 - 35318630 = -35327986\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-35327986>>>"
