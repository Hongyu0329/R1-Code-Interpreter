    "To calculate \\(1 \\times 83\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Multiplication**: Multiplying any number by 1 results in the number itself. This is because 1 is the multiplicative identity, meaning any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Apply the Rule**: Given the rule above, when you multiply 83 by 1, the result is simply 83.\n\n3. **Verification**: To ensure accuracy, consider the definition of multiplication as repeated addition. Here, multiplying by 1 means adding 83 to itself zero additional times, which confirms the result is 83.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: After verifying through understanding and definition, the final answer is confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<83>>>"
