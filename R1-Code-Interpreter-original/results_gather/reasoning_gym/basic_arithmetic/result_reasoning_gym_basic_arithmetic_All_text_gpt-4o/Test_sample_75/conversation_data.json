    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( -8861 * -813 ) ) * -3862\\), we need to carefully evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - Calculate \\(-8861 * -813\\).\n   - Both numbers are negative, so their product will be positive.\n   - \\(-8861 * -813 = 8861 * 813\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the product**:\n   - \\(8861 * 813\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     - \\(8861 * 813 = 7200993\\).\n\n3. **Apply the first negation**:\n   - The expression becomes \\(-7200993\\).\n\n4. **Apply the second negation**:\n   - The expression becomes \\(-(-7200993)\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(7200993\\).\n\n5. **Apply the third negation**:\n   - The expression becomes \\(-7200993\\).\n\n6. **Multiply by \\(-3862\\)**:\n   - The expression is now \\(-7200993 * -3862\\).\n   - Both numbers are negative, so their product will be positive.\n   - Calculate the product:\n     - \\(7200993 * 3862\\).\n\n7. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - \\(7200993 * 3862 = 27808694666\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<27808694666>>>"
