    "To solve the expression \\(-( -659 / 659 + -821 ) * -434\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the division inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-659 / 659\\) equals \\(-1\\) because any number divided by itself is 1, and since the numerator is negative, the result is \\(-1\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - Now we have \\(-1 + -821\\).\n   - Adding these two numbers gives us \\(-1 - 821 = -822\\).\n\n3. **Negate the result from the parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is \\(-822\\), and we have a negative sign outside the parentheses, so we negate \\(-822\\) to get \\(822\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by \\(-434\\):**\n   - Now we need to multiply \\(822\\) by \\(-434\\).\n   - The product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - Calculate \\(822 \\times 434\\):\n     - \\(822 \\times 434 = 356,148\\).\n   - Since one of the numbers is negative, the result is \\(-356,148\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-356148>>>"
