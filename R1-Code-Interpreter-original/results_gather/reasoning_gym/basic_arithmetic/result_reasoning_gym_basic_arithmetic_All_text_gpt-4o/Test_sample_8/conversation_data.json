    "To solve the expression \\(-3 + 2 \\times -9 \\times -5 + -3\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify operations**: The expression contains addition, multiplication, and subtraction.\n\n2. **Perform multiplication first**: According to the order of operations, we need to perform multiplication before addition and subtraction.\n\n   - The multiplication part of the expression is \\(2 \\times -9 \\times -5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(2 \\times -9\\)**:\n   - \\(2 \\times -9 = -18\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\(-18 \\times -5\\)**:\n   - \\(-18 \\times -5 = 90\\) (since multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number).\n\n5. **Substitute back into the expression**: Replace the multiplication part with the result.\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-3 + 90 + -3\\).\n\n6. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**:\n   - First, calculate \\(-3 + 90\\):\n     - \\(-3 + 90 = 87\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(87 + -3\\):\n     - \\(87 + -3 = 84\\).\n\nThe final result of the expression is 84.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<84>>>"
