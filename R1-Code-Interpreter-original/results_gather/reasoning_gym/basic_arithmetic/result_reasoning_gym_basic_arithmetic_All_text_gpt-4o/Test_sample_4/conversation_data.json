    "To solve the expression \\(0 + 7 - -1 / 1\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression contains addition (+), subtraction (-), and division (/).\n\n2. **Division first**: According to the order of operations, we perform division before addition and subtraction. The division in the expression is \\(-1 / 1\\).\n\n   - Calculate \\(-1 / 1\\): \n     \\[\n     -1 / 1 = -1\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the result back into the expression**: Replace \\(-1 / 1\\) with \\(-1\\) in the original expression. The expression now becomes:\n   \\[\n   0 + 7 - (-1)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**: Now, perform the operations from left to right.\n\n   - First, handle the subtraction of a negative number, which is equivalent to addition:\n     \\[\n     0 + 7 - (-1) = 0 + 7 + 1\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform addition**: Now, add the numbers from left to right.\n\n   - Calculate \\(0 + 7\\):\n     \\[\n     0 + 7 = 7\n     \\]\n\n   - Then add the result to 1:\n     \\[\n     7 + 1 = 8\n     \\]\n\nThe final result of the expression \\(0 + 7 - -1 / 1\\) is 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
