    "To calculate the sum of 575 and 683, we can break down the addition process step by step:\n\n1. **Align the Numbers:**\n   - Write the numbers one below the other, aligning them by their rightmost digits (units place).\n   ```\n     575\n   + 683\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the Units Place:**\n   - Add the digits in the units place: 5 (from 575) + 3 (from 683) = 8.\n   - Write 8 in the units place of the result.\n\n3. **Add the Tens Place:**\n   - Add the digits in the tens place: 7 (from 575) + 8 (from 683) = 15.\n   - Since 15 is greater than 9, write 5 in the tens place of the result and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Add the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Add the digits in the hundreds place: 5 (from 575) + 6 (from 683) = 11.\n   - Add the carry-over 1 from the tens place: 11 + 1 = 12.\n   - Write 2 in the hundreds place of the result and carry over 1 to the next place (thousands place).\n\n5. **Add the Thousands Place:**\n   - Since there is no digit in the thousands place in the original numbers, only the carry-over 1 is considered.\n   - Write 1 in the thousands place of the result.\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The final result of the addition is 1258.\n\nTherefore, the sum of 575 and 683 is:\n\n<<<1258>>>"
