    "To solve the expression \\(-9 + -1 \\times -3 \\times -5 + 4\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify and perform multiplication first:**\n   - The multiplication part of the expression is \\(-1 \\times -3 \\times -5\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(-1 \\times -3\\):\n     \\[\n     -1 \\times -3 = 3\n     \\]\n   - Next, use the result to calculate \\(3 \\times -5\\):\n     \\[\n     3 \\times -5 = -15\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-9 + (-15) + 4\\).\n\n3. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:**\n   - First, calculate \\(-9 + (-15)\\):\n     \\[\n     -9 + (-15) = -24\n     \\]\n   - Next, add 4 to the result:\n     \\[\n     -24 + 4 = -20\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer to the expression is \\(-20\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-20>>>"
