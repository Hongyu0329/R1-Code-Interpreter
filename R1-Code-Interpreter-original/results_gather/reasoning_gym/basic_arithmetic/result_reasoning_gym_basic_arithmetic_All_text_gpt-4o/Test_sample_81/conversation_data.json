    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-20 \\times -106\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Multiplication of Negative Numbers**: \n   - When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive. This is a fundamental rule in arithmetic. Therefore, \\(-20 \\times -106\\) will yield a positive result.\n\n2. **Multiply the Absolute Values**:\n   - Ignore the negative signs for a moment and multiply the absolute values of the numbers. The absolute value of \\(-20\\) is \\(20\\), and the absolute value of \\(-106\\) is \\(106\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(20 \\times 106\\).\n   - Break it down into simpler steps if needed:\n     - \\(20 \\times 100 = 2000\\)\n     - \\(20 \\times 6 = 120\\)\n   - Add these results together: \\(2000 + 120 = 2120\\).\n\n4. **Apply the Sign Rule**:\n   - Since both original numbers were negative, the result of their multiplication is positive. Therefore, the final result is \\(2120\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we have considered all necessary arithmetic rules and calculations.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2120>>>"
