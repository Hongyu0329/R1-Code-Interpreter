    "To solve the expression \\((-5 \\times 8) \\times -6\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves multiplication only, so we will perform the operations from left to right.\n\n2. **First multiplication**: \n   - Calculate \\(-5 \\times 8\\).\n   - \\(-5 \\times 8 = -40\\).\n   - This is because multiplying a negative number by a positive number results in a negative number.\n\n3. **Second multiplication**:\n   - Now, take the result from the first multiplication and multiply it by \\(-6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-40 \\times -6\\).\n   - \\(-40 \\times -6 = 240\\).\n   - This is because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n\n4. **Final result**: The result of the expression \\((-5 \\times 8) \\times -6\\) is 240.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<240>>>"
