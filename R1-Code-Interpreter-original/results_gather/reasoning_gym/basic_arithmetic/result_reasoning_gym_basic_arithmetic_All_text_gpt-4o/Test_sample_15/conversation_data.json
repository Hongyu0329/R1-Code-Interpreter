  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-( ( 4 + -9 * 8 ) + 9 )\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Start by solving the expression inside the innermost parentheses.\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is \\(4 + -9 * 8\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Within the parentheses, perform the multiplication first.\n   - Calculate \\(-9 * 8\\).\n   - \\(-9 * 8 = -72\\).\n\n3. **Addition**: Now, add the result of the multiplication to 4.\n   - Calculate \\(4 + (-72)\\).\n   - \\(4 + (-72) = 4 - 72 = -68\\).\n\n4. **Outer Parentheses**: Now, substitute back into the original expression.\n   - The expression becomes \\(-( -68 + 9 )\\).\n\n5. **Addition**: Solve the expression inside the parentheses.\n   - Calculate \\(-68 + 9\\).\n   - \\(-68 + 9 = -59\\).\n\n6. **Negation**: Finally, apply the negation to the result.\n   - Calculate \\(-(-59)\\).\n   - \\(-(-59) = 59\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<59>>>"
