    "To solve the expression \\(5976 - -2823 - 816\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations and handle the negative signs correctly. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the expression**: The expression given is \\(5976 - -2823 - 816\\).\n\n2. **Handle double negatives**: The expression contains a double negative, \\(- -2823\\). According to the rules of arithmetic, subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive of that number. Therefore, \\(- -2823\\) becomes \\(+ 2823\\).\n\n3. **Rewrite the expression**: After handling the double negative, the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   5976 + 2823 - 816\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the addition**: Add the first two numbers:\n   \\[\n   5976 + 2823 = 8799\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the subtraction**: Subtract the last number from the result of the addition:\n   \\[\n   8799 - 816 = 7983\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final result**: The final result of the expression is 7983.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<7983>>>"
