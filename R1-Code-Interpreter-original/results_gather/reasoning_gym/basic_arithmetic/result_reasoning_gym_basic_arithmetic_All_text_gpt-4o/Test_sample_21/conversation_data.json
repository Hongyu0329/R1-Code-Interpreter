    "To solve the expression \\(( -( -56 * -33 + -87 ) * 13 ) - -67 - 30\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses is \\(-56 * -33\\).\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number: \n     \\[\n     -56 * -33 = 1848\n     \\]\n\n2. **Add the result to \\(-87\\):**\n   - The expression now becomes \\(1848 + -87\\).\n   - Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting the positive equivalent:\n     \\[\n     1848 - 87 = 1761\n     \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the result by 13:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-(1761) * 13\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(1761 * 13\\):\n     \\[\n     1761 * 13 = 22893\n     \\]\n   - Since the expression is \\(-(1761 * 13)\\), it becomes:\n     \\[\n     -22893\n     \\]\n\n4. **Subtract \\(-67\\) from the result:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-22893 - -67\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive equivalent:\n     \\[\n     -22893 + 67 = -22826\n     \\]\n\n5. **Subtract 30 from the result:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-22826 - 30\\).\n   - Subtracting 30 gives:\n     \\[\n     -22826 - 30 = -22856\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-22856}\n\\]\n\nOutputting the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<-22856>>>"
