    "To solve the expression \\(-17 - -17 * -92 - -8 - -83\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves subtraction and multiplication. According to PEMDAS, we should perform multiplication before subtraction.\n\n2. **Simplify the expression**: \n   - The expression is \\(-17 - (-17) \\times (-92) - (-8) - (-83)\\).\n   - Notice that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart. Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as:\n     \\(-17 + 17 \\times 92 + 8 + 83\\).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(17 \\times 92\\).\n   - \\(17 \\times 92 = 1564\\).\n\n4. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-17 + 1564 + 8 + 83\\).\n\n5. **Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right**:\n   - Start with \\(-17 + 1564\\):\n     - \\(-17 + 1564 = 1547\\).\n   - Add 8 to the result:\n     - \\(1547 + 8 = 1555\\).\n   - Finally, add 83:\n     - \\(1555 + 83 = 1638\\).\n\n6. **Final result**: The final result of the expression is 1638.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<1638>>>"
