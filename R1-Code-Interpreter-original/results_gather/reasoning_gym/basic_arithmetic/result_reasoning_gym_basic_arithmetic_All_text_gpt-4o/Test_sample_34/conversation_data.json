    "To solve the problem \\(-(765 \\times -805)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to calculate the product of two numbers, 765 and -805, and then negate the result.\n\n2. **Multiplication of Integers**: \n   - When multiplying two numbers, the product of a positive number and a negative number is negative.\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive.\n\n3. **Calculate the Product**:\n   - First, calculate the product of 765 and -805.\n   - Since one of the numbers is negative, the product will be negative: \\(765 \\times -805 = -615,825\\).\n\n4. **Negate the Result**:\n   - The problem asks for the negation of the product: \\(-(-615,825)\\).\n   - Negating a negative number results in a positive number.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The negation of \\(-615,825\\) is \\(615,825\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<615,825>>>"
