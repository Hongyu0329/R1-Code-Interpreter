    "To solve the problem of calculating \\( \\frac{3}{3} \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Division**: Division is the process of determining how many times one number is contained within another. In this case, we are dividing 3 by 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Dividend and Divisor**: \n   - The dividend is the number being divided, which is 3.\n   - The divisor is the number by which the dividend is divided, which is also 3.\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   - When you divide a number by itself (except for zero), the result is always 1. This is because any number divided by itself is equal to one whole.\n\n4. **Check for Special Cases**: \n   - Ensure that the divisor is not zero, as division by zero is undefined. In this case, the divisor is 3, so this is not a concern.\n\n5. **Calculate the Result**: \n   - \\( \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\).\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - Multiply the result by the divisor to check if you get back the original dividend: \\( 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\). This confirms that the division was performed correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the result of the division.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>"
