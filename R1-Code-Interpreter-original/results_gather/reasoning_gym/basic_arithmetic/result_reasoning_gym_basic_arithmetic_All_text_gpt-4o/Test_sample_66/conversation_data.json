    "To solve the expression \\(6 - 8 + 6 - -8\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations and handle each step one by one. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves subtraction and addition. It is important to note the presence of a double negative, which will affect the calculation.\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression step by step**:\n   - Start with the first operation: \\(6 - 8\\).\n     - \\(6 - 8 = -2\\).\n   - Next, add 6 to the result of the first operation: \\(-2 + 6\\).\n     - \\(-2 + 6 = 4\\).\n   - Finally, handle the double negative: \\(4 - -8\\).\n     - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(4 - -8\\) becomes \\(4 + 8\\).\n     - \\(4 + 8 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Final result**: After evaluating all the operations step by step, the final result of the expression is 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
