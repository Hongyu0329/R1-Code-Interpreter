    "To solve the expression \\(-7829 \\times 9925 \\times -4426 \\times 1291 - -1252\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations and handle the signs correctly. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: The expression consists of a multiplication of four numbers and a subtraction of a negative number. The numbers involved are \\(-7829\\), \\(9925\\), \\(-4426\\), \\(1291\\), and \\(-1252\\).\n\n2. **Understand the signs**: \n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative product.\n   - Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive of that number.\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply the first two numbers: \\(-7829 \\times 9925\\).\n     - The product will be negative because one number is negative and the other is positive.\n   - Multiply the result by the third number: \\(-4426\\).\n     - The product will be positive because both numbers are negative.\n   - Finally, multiply the result by the fourth number: \\(1291\\).\n     - The product will be positive because both numbers are positive.\n\n4. **Handle the subtraction**:\n   - The expression \\(- -1252\\) simplifies to \\(+1252\\).\n\n5. **Combine the results**:\n   - Add the result of the multiplication to \\(1252\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate each step:\n\n- Calculate \\(-7829 \\times 9925\\):\n  - The result is negative: \\(-77640925\\).\n\n- Multiply by \\(-4426\\):\n  - The result is positive: \\(343679898850\\).\n\n- Multiply by \\(1291\\):\n  - The result is positive: \\(443646755083350\\).\n\n- Add \\(1252\\) to the result:\n  - Final result: \\(443646755084602\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<443646755084602>>>"
