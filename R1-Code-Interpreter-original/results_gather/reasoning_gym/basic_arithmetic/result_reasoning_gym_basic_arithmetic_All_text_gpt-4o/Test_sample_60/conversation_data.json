    "To solve the problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Division**: The first operation to perform is the division.\n   - Calculate \\(168 \\div 56\\).\n   - 168 divided by 56 equals 3.\n\n2. **Addition**: After completing the division, we proceed with the addition of the numbers.\n   - Add the result of the division to the other numbers: \\(3 + 717 + 766 + 315\\).\n\n3. **Step-by-step addition**:\n   - First, add 3 and 717: \\(3 + 717 = 720\\).\n   - Next, add 720 and 766: \\(720 + 766 = 1486\\).\n   - Finally, add 1486 and 315: \\(1486 + 315 = 1801\\).\n\nThe final result of the calculation is 1801.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<1801>>>"
