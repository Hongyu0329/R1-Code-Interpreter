    "To solve the expression \\(655 - -43 \\times 623 + -684\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves subtraction, multiplication, and addition.\n\n2. **Handle the multiplication first**: According to the order of operations, we first perform the multiplication.\n   - The multiplication part of the expression is \\(-43 \\times 623\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-43 \\times 623\\):\n     \\[\n     -43 \\times 623 = -26789\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the result back into the expression**: Replace \\(-43 \\times 623\\) with \\(-26789\\) in the original expression.\n   - The expression now becomes \\(655 - (-26789) + -684\\).\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**: \n   - The expression \\(655 - (-26789)\\) is equivalent to \\(655 + 26789\\) because subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive.\n   - Calculate \\(655 + 26789\\):\n     \\[\n     655 + 26789 = 27444\n     \\]\n\n5. **Complete the addition**: Now, add \\(-684\\) to the result from the previous step.\n   - The expression is now \\(27444 + (-684)\\), which is equivalent to \\(27444 - 684\\).\n   - Calculate \\(27444 - 684\\):\n     \\[\n     27444 - 684 = 26760\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final result**: The final result of the expression is 26760.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the expression \\(655 - -43 \\times 623 + -684\\) is:\n\n<<<26760>>>"
