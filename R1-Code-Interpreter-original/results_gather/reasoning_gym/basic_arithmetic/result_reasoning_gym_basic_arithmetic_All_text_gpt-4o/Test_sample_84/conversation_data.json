    "To solve the expression \\( 542 + -9 + -438 / -( 953 * -340 + -324018 ) \\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: \n   - First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\( 953 * -340 + -324018 \\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\( 953 * -340 \\).\n   - \\( 953 * -340 = -324020 \\).\n\n3. **Addition**:\n   - Add the result of the multiplication to \\(-324018\\).\n   - \\(-324020 + -324018 = -648038\\).\n\n4. **Division**:\n   - Now, divide \\(-438\\) by the result of the expression inside the parentheses.\n   - \\(-438 / -(-648038)\\).\n   - Since the division involves a negative sign outside the parentheses, it becomes \\(-438 / 648038\\).\n\n5. **Simplification**:\n   - Simplify the division: \\(-438 / 648038\\).\n   - This results in a very small positive number, approximately \\(0.0006759\\).\n\n6. **Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - Now, add and subtract the remaining numbers in the expression: \\(542 + -9 + 0.0006759\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(542 + -9 = 533\\).\n   - Then, add the result of the division: \\(533 + 0.0006759 = 533.0006759\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<533.0006759>>>"
