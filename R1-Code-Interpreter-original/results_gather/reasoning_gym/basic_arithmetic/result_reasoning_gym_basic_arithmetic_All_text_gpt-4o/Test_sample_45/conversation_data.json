    "To solve the expression \\(685 + -401 / 1 + -702\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify operations**: The expression contains addition, division, and another addition (which involves a negative number, effectively making it a subtraction).\n\n2. **Division first**: According to the order of operations, we perform division before addition and subtraction. The division in the expression is \\(-401 / 1\\).\n\n   \\[\n   -401 / 1 = -401\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute back into the expression**: Replace the division part with the result.\n\n   \\[\n   685 + (-401) + (-702)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**:\n\n   - First, calculate \\(685 + (-401)\\):\n\n     \\[\n     685 - 401 = 284\n     \\]\n\n   - Next, calculate \\(284 + (-702)\\):\n\n     \\[\n     284 - 702 = -418\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final result**: The result of the expression is \\(-418\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-418>>>"
