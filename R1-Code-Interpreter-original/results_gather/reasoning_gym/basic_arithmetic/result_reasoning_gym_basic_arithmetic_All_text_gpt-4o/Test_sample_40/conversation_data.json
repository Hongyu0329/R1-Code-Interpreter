    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( 80 * -2 ) )\\), we need to carefully analyze and simplify it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost operation**: The expression inside the parentheses is \\(80 * -2\\).\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication**: \n   - Multiply 80 by -2.\n   - \\(80 * -2 = -160\\).\n\n3. **Address the first negation**: \n   - The result of the multiplication is -160, and it is negated by the first negative sign.\n   - \\(-(-160) = 160\\).\n\n4. **Address the second negation**: \n   - The result from the previous step is 160, and it is negated by the outer negative sign.\n   - \\(-(160) = -160\\).\n\n5. **Final result**: The final result of the expression is -160.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-160>>>"
