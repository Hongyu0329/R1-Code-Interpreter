    "To solve the expression \\(-85 + -41 \\times 28 - 45\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify operations**: The expression contains addition, multiplication, and subtraction.\n\n2. **Perform multiplication first**: According to the order of operations, we perform multiplication before addition and subtraction.\n   - Calculate \\(-41 \\times 28\\):\n     \\[\n     -41 \\times 28 = -1148\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the result back into the expression**: Replace \\(-41 \\times 28\\) with \\(-1148\\) in the original expression.\n   - The expression now becomes: \\(-85 + (-1148) - 45\\).\n\n4. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**:\n   - First, calculate \\(-85 + (-1148)\\):\n     \\[\n     -85 + (-1148) = -85 - 1148 = -1233\n     \\]\n   - Next, calculate \\(-1233 - 45\\):\n     \\[\n     -1233 - 45 = -1278\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final result**: The final result of the expression is \\(-1278\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the expression \\(-85 + -41 \\times 28 - 45\\) is:\n\n<<<-1278>>>"
