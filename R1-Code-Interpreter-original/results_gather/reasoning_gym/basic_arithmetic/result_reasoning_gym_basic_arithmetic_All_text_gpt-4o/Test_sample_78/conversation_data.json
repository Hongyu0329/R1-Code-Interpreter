    "To solve the problem \\(-29 \\times 39 \\times -80 \\times 7 \\times -70\\), we need to carefully consider the multiplication of these numbers, especially the signs, as they will affect the final result. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the signs of the numbers:**\n   - \\(-29\\) is negative.\n   - \\(39\\) is positive.\n   - \\(-80\\) is negative.\n   - \\(7\\) is positive.\n   - \\(-70\\) is negative.\n\n2. **Determine the overall sign of the product:**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.\n   - We have three negative numbers: \\(-29\\), \\(-80\\), and \\(-70\\).\n   - The product of three negative numbers is negative because:\n     - \\((-29) \\times (-80)\\) is positive.\n     - The result of the above positive number multiplied by \\(-70\\) is negative.\n\n3. **Calculate the absolute values:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers:\n     \\[\n     29 \\times 39 \\times 80 \\times 7 \\times 70\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication step by step:**\n   - Calculate \\(29 \\times 39\\):\n     \\[\n     29 \\times 39 = 1131\n     \\]\n   - Multiply the result by \\(80\\):\n     \\[\n     1131 \\times 80 = 90480\n     \\]\n   - Multiply the result by \\(7\\):\n     \\[\n     90480 \\times 7 = 633360\n     \\]\n   - Finally, multiply the result by \\(70\\):\n     \\[\n     633360 \\times 70 = 44335200\n     \\]\n\n5. **Apply the sign to the final product:**\n   - Since we determined the overall sign of the product is negative, the final result is:\n     \\[\n     -44335200\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<-44335200>>>}\n\\]"
