    "To solve the expression \\(0 + -3 - -6 / (1 * 7 + -6)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: \n   - The expression inside the parentheses is \\(1 * 7 + -6\\).\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(1 * 7 = 7\\).\n   - Then, perform the addition: \\(7 + -6 = 1\\).\n   - So, the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to 1.\n\n2. **Division**:\n   - Now, substitute back into the main expression: \\(0 + -3 - -6 / 1\\).\n   - Perform the division: \\(-6 / 1 = -6\\).\n\n3. **Subtraction and Addition**:\n   - Substitute the result of the division back into the expression: \\(0 + -3 - (-6)\\).\n   - Simplify the subtraction of a negative number: \\(-3 - (-6) = -3 + 6\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-3 + 6 = 3\\).\n\n4. **Final Addition**:\n   - Add the result to 0: \\(0 + 3 = 3\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
