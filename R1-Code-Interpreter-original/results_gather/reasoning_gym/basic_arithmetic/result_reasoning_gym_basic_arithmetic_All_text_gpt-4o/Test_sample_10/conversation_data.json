    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-5 \\times -6\\), we need to follow a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are asked to multiply two negative numbers, \\(-5\\) and \\(-6\\).\n\n2. **Rules of Multiplication with Negative Numbers**:\n   - The product of two numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative) is positive.\n   - The product of two numbers with different signs (one positive and one negative) is negative.\n\n3. **Applying the Rule**:\n   - Since both numbers in this problem are negative, the product will be positive.\n\n4. **Performing the Multiplication**:\n   - Ignore the signs for a moment and multiply the absolute values of the numbers: \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\n5. **Applying the Sign**:\n   - As determined earlier, the product of two negative numbers is positive. Therefore, the result is \\(+30\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final result of \\(-5 \\times -6\\) is \\(30\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we have considered all necessary points and applied the correct rules of arithmetic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<30>>>"
