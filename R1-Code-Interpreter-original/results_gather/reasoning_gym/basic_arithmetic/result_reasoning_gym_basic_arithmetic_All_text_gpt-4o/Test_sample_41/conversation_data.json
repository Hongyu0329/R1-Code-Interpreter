  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\( (6 / 3 + 5 + -1) \\), we will follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The entire expression is within parentheses, but there are no nested parentheses to simplify first. We will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses as a whole.\n\n2. **Division**: Within the parentheses, the first operation according to PEMDAS is division.\n   - Calculate \\( 6 / 3 \\).\n   - \\( 6 / 3 = 2 \\).\n\n3. **Addition**: Next, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n   - Start with the result from the division: \\( 2 \\).\n   - Add 5: \\( 2 + 5 = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Subtraction**: Finally, perform the subtraction.\n   - Subtract 1 from the result of the addition: \\( 7 + (-1) = 6 \\).\n\nThe final result of the expression \\( (6 / 3 + 5 + -1) \\) is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
