    "To solve the expression \\(-29 - 67 \\times 36 + 67 \\times 29 - 76\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify and perform multiplication operations first:**\n   - Calculate \\(67 \\times 36\\).\n   - Calculate \\(67 \\times 29\\).\n\n2. **Perform the multiplications:**\n   - \\(67 \\times 36 = 2412\\).\n   - \\(67 \\times 29 = 1943\\).\n\n3. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes \\(-29 - 2412 + 1943 - 76\\).\n\n4. **Perform the operations from left to right:**\n   - Start with \\(-29 - 2412\\):\n     - \\(-29 - 2412 = -2441\\).\n   - Next, add \\(1943\\) to \\(-2441\\):\n     - \\(-2441 + 1943 = -498\\).\n   - Finally, subtract \\(76\\) from \\(-498\\):\n     - \\(-498 - 76 = -574\\).\n\n5. **Conclude with the final result:**\n   - The final answer to the expression is \\(-574\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-574>>>"
