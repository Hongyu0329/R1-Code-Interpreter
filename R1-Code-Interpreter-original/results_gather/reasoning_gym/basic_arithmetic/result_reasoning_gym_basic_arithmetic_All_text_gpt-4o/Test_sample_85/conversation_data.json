    "To solve the expression \\(-46 / 23 + 43\\), we will break it down into steps and carefully analyze each part:\n\n1. **Division**: \n   - Calculate \\(-46 / 23\\).\n   - Since both numbers are negative and positive respectively, the result will be negative.\n   - \\(-46\\) divided by \\(23\\) equals \\(-2\\).\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   - Now, add the result from the division to \\(43\\).\n   - The expression becomes \\(-2 + 43\\).\n\n3. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Calculate \\(-2 + 43\\).\n   - Adding a negative number is equivalent to subtracting its absolute value from the positive number.\n   - So, \\(43 - 2 = 41\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(-46 / 23 + 43\\) is:\n\n<<<41>>>"
