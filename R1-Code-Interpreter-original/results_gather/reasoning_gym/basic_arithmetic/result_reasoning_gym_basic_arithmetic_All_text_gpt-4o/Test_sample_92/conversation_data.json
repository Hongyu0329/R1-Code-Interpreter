    "To solve the expression \\(( ( 3 * -9 ) ) / 27 + -9\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**:  \n   The innermost expression is \\(3 * -9\\).  \n   - Calculate \\(3 * -9 = -27\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:  \n   Now the expression becomes \\((-27) / 27 + -9\\).\n\n3. **Perform the division**:  \n   Evaluate \\(-27 / 27\\).  \n   - Calculate \\(-27 / 27 = -1\\).\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:  \n   Now the expression becomes \\(-1 + -9\\).\n\n5. **Perform the addition**:  \n   Evaluate \\(-1 + -9\\).  \n   - Calculate \\(-1 + -9 = -10\\).\n\nAfter following these steps, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-10>>>"
