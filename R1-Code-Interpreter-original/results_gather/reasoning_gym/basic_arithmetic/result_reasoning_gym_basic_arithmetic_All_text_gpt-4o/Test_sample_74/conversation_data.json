    "To solve the expression \\(-( -1 + ( 0 * -2 ) / 3 + 6 )\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - Inside the parentheses, we have \\(0 * -2\\).\n   - Multiplying 0 by any number results in 0. So, \\(0 * -2 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-( -1 + 0 / 3 + 6 )\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the division**:\n   - Next, we have \\(0 / 3\\).\n   - Dividing 0 by any non-zero number results in 0. So, \\(0 / 3 = 0\\).\n\n4. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-( -1 + 0 + 6 )\\).\n\n5. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - Combine the terms inside the parentheses: \\(-1 + 0 + 6\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(5\\).\n\n6. **Apply the negative sign outside the parentheses**:\n   - The expression now is \\(-5\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-5>>>"
