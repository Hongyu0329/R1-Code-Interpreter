    "To solve the expression \\( -( -( 9 / 3 ) ) / 1 \\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: Start by evaluating the expression inside the innermost parentheses.\n   - The expression is \\( 9 / 3 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 9 / 3 = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Negation**: Apply the negation to the result from step 1.\n   - The expression becomes \\( -(3) \\).\n   - Calculate \\( -(3) = -3 \\).\n\n3. **Double Negation**: Apply the second negation to the result from step 2.\n   - The expression becomes \\( -(-3) \\).\n   - Calculate \\( -(-3) = 3 \\).\n\n4. **Division by 1**: Finally, divide the result from step 3 by 1.\n   - The expression becomes \\( 3 / 1 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 3 / 1 = 3 \\).\n\nAfter following these steps, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
