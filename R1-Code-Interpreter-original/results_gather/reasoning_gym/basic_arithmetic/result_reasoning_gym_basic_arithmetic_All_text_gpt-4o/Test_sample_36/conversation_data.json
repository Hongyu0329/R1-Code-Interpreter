    "To solve the expression \\(-( ( -8 / 1 ) * -7 ) - -3 + 5\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expression**: \n   - The innermost expression is \\(-8 / 1\\).\n   - \\(-8 / 1 = -8\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-( ( -8 ) * -7 ) - -3 + 5\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\((-8) * -7\\).\n   - \\(-8 * -7 = 56\\).\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-( 56 ) - -3 + 5\\).\n\n5. **Evaluate the negation**:\n   - Calculate \\(-(56)\\).\n   - \\(-(56) = -56\\).\n\n6. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-56 - -3 + 5\\).\n\n7. **Evaluate the subtraction of a negative number**:\n   - Calculate \\(-56 - -3\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(-56 - -3 = -56 + 3 = -53\\).\n\n8. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-53 + 5\\).\n\n9. **Evaluate the final addition**:\n   - Calculate \\(-53 + 5\\).\n   - \\(-53 + 5 = -48\\).\n\nThe final answer to the expression is \\(-48\\).\n\n<<<-48>>>"
