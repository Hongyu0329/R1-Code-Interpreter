    "To solve the problem of calculating \\( 393 + (-683) \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Operation**: The problem involves addition, but since one of the numbers is negative, it effectively becomes a subtraction problem.\n\n2. **Understand the Numbers**:\n   - The first number is \\( 393 \\).\n   - The second number is \\( -683 \\).\n\n3. **Reframe the Problem**: \n   - Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting the absolute value of that number.\n   - Therefore, \\( 393 + (-683) \\) is equivalent to \\( 393 - 683 \\).\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - Start with the smaller number, \\( 393 \\), and subtract the larger number, \\( 683 \\).\n   - Since \\( 393 \\) is less than \\( 683 \\), the result will be negative.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Subtract \\( 393 \\) from \\( 683 \\): \n     \\[\n     683 - 393 = 290\n     \\]\n   - Since the original operation was \\( 393 - 683 \\), the result is negative:\n     \\[\n     393 - 683 = -290\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Double-check the subtraction to ensure accuracy:\n     - \\( 683 - 393 = 290 \\)\n     - Therefore, \\( 393 - 683 = -290 \\).\n\n7. **Conclude with the Final Answer**:\n   - The result of \\( 393 + (-683) \\) is \\(-290\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-290>>>"
