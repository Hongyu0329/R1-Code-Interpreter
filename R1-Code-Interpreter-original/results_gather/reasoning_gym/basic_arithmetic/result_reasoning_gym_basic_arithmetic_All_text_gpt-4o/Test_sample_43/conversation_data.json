    "To solve the expression \\(6845 \\times 5489 \\times 1327 + 388 + (-1002)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   - First, calculate the product of the three numbers: \\(6845 \\times 5489 \\times 1327\\).\n   - This is a large multiplication problem, so it is best to break it down into smaller steps or use a calculator for precision.\n\n2. **Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - After obtaining the result from the multiplication, add 388 to it.\n   - Then, subtract 1002 from the result of the addition.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Multiplication\n- Calculate \\(6845 \\times 5489\\).\n- Multiply the result by 1327.\n\n### Step 2: Addition\n- Add 388 to the result from the multiplication.\n\n### Step 3: Subtraction\n- Subtract 1002 from the result of the addition.\n\n### Final Calculation\n- After performing the above steps, you will have the final result.\n\nNow, let's compute the values:\n\n1. **Multiplication**:\n   - \\(6845 \\times 5489 = 37,558,405\\).\n   - \\(37,558,405 \\times 1327 = 49,835,853,635\\).\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   - \\(49,835,853,635 + 388 = 49,835,854,023\\).\n\n3. **Subtraction**:\n   - \\(49,835,854,023 - 1002 = 49,835,853,021\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<49,835,853,021>>>"
