    "To solve the expression \\(-96 \\times -78 \\times -29 + -88 - -7 \\times -4\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify and perform the multiplications first:**\n\n   - Calculate \\(-96 \\times -78\\):\n     \\[\n     -96 \\times -78 = 7488\n     \\]\n     (Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.)\n\n   - Use the result from the previous step to calculate \\(7488 \\times -29\\):\n     \\[\n     7488 \\times -29 = -217152\n     \\]\n     (Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.)\n\n   - Calculate \\(-7 \\times -4\\):\n     \\[\n     -7 \\times -4 = 28\n     \\]\n     (Again, multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.)\n\n2. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**\n\n   The expression now becomes:\n   \\[\n   -217152 + -88 - 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:**\n\n   - Calculate \\(-217152 + -88\\):\n     \\[\n     -217152 + -88 = -217240\n     \\]\n     (Adding two negative numbers results in a more negative number.)\n\n   - Calculate \\(-217240 - 28\\):\n     \\[\n     -217240 - 28 = -217268\n     \\]\n     (Subtracting a positive number from a negative number results in a more negative number.)\n\nThe final result of the expression is \\(-217268\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<-217268>>>"
