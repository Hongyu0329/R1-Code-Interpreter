    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-340 + -683\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to add two negative numbers: \\(-340\\) and \\(-683\\).\n\n2. **Recognize the Operation**: Adding two negative numbers involves adding their absolute values and then applying the negative sign to the result.\n\n3. **Calculate the Absolute Values**:\n   - The absolute value of \\(-340\\) is \\(340\\).\n   - The absolute value of \\(-683\\) is \\(683\\).\n\n4. **Add the Absolute Values**:\n   - \\(340 + 683 = 1023\\).\n\n5. **Apply the Negative Sign**: Since both original numbers were negative, the result of their addition will also be negative.\n\n6. **Final Result**: The sum of \\(-340\\) and \\(-683\\) is \\(-1023\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1023>>>"
