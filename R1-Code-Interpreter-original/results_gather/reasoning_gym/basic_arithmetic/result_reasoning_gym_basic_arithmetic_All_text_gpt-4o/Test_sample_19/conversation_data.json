  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-40 \\times ((-98 + -92))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expression inside the parentheses.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have \\((-98 + -92)\\).\n   - Adding the two negative numbers: \\(-98 + -92 = -190\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Next, multiply the result from the parentheses by \\(-40\\).\n   - The expression now is \\(-40 \\times (-190)\\).\n   - Multiplying a negative number by another negative number results in a positive number.\n   - Calculate the multiplication: \\(-40 \\times -190 = 7600\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<7600>>>"
