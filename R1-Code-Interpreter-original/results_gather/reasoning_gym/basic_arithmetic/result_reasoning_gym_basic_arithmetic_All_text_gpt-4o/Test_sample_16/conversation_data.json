    "To solve the expression \\(-( 463 / 1 ) - 10 - 562 - -849 - -869\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the division**: \n   - \\(463 / 1 = 463\\)\n\n2. **Apply the negative sign to the result of the division**:\n   - \\(-(463) = -463\\)\n\n3. **Subtract 10 from the result**:\n   - \\(-463 - 10 = -473\\)\n\n4. **Subtract 562 from the result**:\n   - \\(-473 - 562 = -1035\\)\n\n5. **Subtract the negative of 849 (which is equivalent to adding 849)**:\n   - \\(-1035 - (-849) = -1035 + 849 = -186\\)\n\n6. **Subtract the negative of 869 (which is equivalent to adding 869)**:\n   - \\(-186 - (-869) = -186 + 869 = 683\\)\n\nAfter performing all these steps, the final result of the expression is:\n\n<<<683>>>"
