    "To calculate \\(-7 \\times 8\\), we can break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps. Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two numbers: \\(-7\\) and \\(8\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Signs**: \n   - The first number is \\(-7\\), which is negative.\n   - The second number is \\(8\\), which is positive.\n\n3. **Determine the Sign of the Result**:\n   - When multiplying a negative number by a positive number, the result is negative.\n\n4. **Multiply the Absolute Values**:\n   - Ignore the signs for a moment and multiply the absolute values of the numbers.\n   - The absolute value of \\(-7\\) is \\(7\\).\n   - The absolute value of \\(8\\) is \\(8\\).\n   - Multiply these absolute values: \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\).\n\n5. **Apply the Sign to the Result**:\n   - Since we determined that the result should be negative, we apply the negative sign to the product of the absolute values.\n   - Therefore, the result is \\(-56\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final result of \\(-7 \\times 8\\) is \\(-56\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we have carefully considered each part of the multiplication process, including the handling of negative numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-56>>>"
