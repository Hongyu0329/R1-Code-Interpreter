    "To solve the expression \\(5834 + (-4946) - 7679\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   - The expression consists of three numbers: 5834, -4946, and -7679.\n   - The operations involved are addition and subtraction.\n\n2. **Break Down the Expression:**\n   - The expression can be rewritten as: \\(5834 + (-4946) - 7679\\).\n   - This is equivalent to: \\(5834 - 4946 - 7679\\).\n\n3. **Perform the First Operation:**\n   - Calculate \\(5834 - 4946\\).\n   - Align the numbers for subtraction:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{c}\n     \\phantom{0}5834 \\\\\n     -4946 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - Subtract each digit starting from the right:\n     - Units: \\(4 - 6\\) requires borrowing, so it becomes \\(14 - 6 = 8\\).\n     - Tens: \\(2 - 4\\) (after borrowing) requires borrowing again, so it becomes \\(12 - 4 = 8\\).\n     - Hundreds: \\(7 - 9\\) (after borrowing) requires borrowing again, so it becomes \\(17 - 9 = 8\\).\n     - Thousands: \\(4 - 4 = 0\\).\n   - Result of \\(5834 - 4946\\) is 888.\n\n4. **Perform the Second Operation:**\n   - Now calculate \\(888 - 7679\\).\n   - Align the numbers for subtraction:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{c}\n     \\phantom{0}0888 \\\\\n     -7679 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - Subtract each digit starting from the right:\n     - Units: \\(8 - 9\\) requires borrowing, so it becomes \\(18 - 9 = 9\\).\n     - Tens: \\(7 - 7 = 0\\).\n     - Hundreds: \\(8 - 6 = 2\\).\n     - Thousands: \\(0 - 7\\) requires borrowing, so it becomes \\(10 - 7 = 3\\).\n   - Result of \\(888 - 7679\\) is -6791.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\(5834 + (-4946) - 7679\\) is -6791.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<-6791>>>"
