  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\((6 + -4 - 0 * -5 - -3) / 5\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The entire expression is within parentheses, but there are no nested parentheses to simplify first. We will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Inside the parentheses, we have a multiplication operation: \\(0 * -5\\).\n   - Calculate \\(0 * -5 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Substitution**: Substitute the result of the multiplication back into the expression:\n   - The expression becomes \\(6 + -4 - 0 - -3\\).\n\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Now, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   - \\(6 + -4 = 2\\).\n   - \\(2 - 0 = 2\\).\n   - \\(2 - -3 = 2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\n5. **Division**: Now, divide the result by 5:\n   - \\(5 / 5 = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\((6 + -4 - 0 * -5 - -3) / 5\\) is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
