    "To solve the expression \\(-65 - -9292 + 5869 + -6236\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations and handle each term step by step.\n\n1. **Identify and Simplify Double Negatives:**\n   - The expression contains a double negative: \\(-65 - -9292\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive value. Therefore, \\(-65 - -9292\\) becomes \\(-65 + 9292\\).\n\n2. **Perform the Addition/Subtraction:**\n   - Start with the first two terms: \\(-65 + 9292\\).\n     - Calculate: \\(9292 - 65 = 9227\\).\n\n3. **Add the Next Term:**\n   - Now add the next term, \\(5869\\), to the result from the previous step.\n     - Calculate: \\(9227 + 5869 = 15096\\).\n\n4. **Add the Final Term:**\n   - Finally, add the last term, \\(-6236\\), to the current result.\n     - Calculate: \\(15096 - 6236 = 8860\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we have carefully calculated the expression.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<8860>>>"
