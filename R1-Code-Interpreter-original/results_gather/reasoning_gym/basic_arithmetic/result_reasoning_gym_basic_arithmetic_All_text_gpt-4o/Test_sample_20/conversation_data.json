    "To solve the expression \\((-5 - -(( -2 + -4 )) - -2)\\), we need to carefully evaluate it step by step, following the order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction, also known as PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses**: \n   - Inside the expression, we have \\((-2 + -4)\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-2 + -4\\): \n     \\[\n     -2 + -4 = -6\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\((-5 - -(-6) - -2)\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the double negative**:\n   - The expression \\(-(-6)\\) simplifies to \\(6\\).\n\n4. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\((-5 - 6 - -2)\\).\n\n5. **Evaluate the subtraction and double negative**:\n   - First, calculate \\(-5 - 6\\):\n     \\[\n     -5 - 6 = -11\n     \\]\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-11 - -2\\).\n\n6. **Evaluate the double negative**:\n   - The expression \\(- -2\\) simplifies to \\(+2\\).\n\n7. **Substitute the result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(-11 + 2\\).\n\n8. **Evaluate the final addition**:\n   - Calculate \\(-11 + 2\\):\n     \\[\n     -11 + 2 = -9\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is \\(-9\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-9>>>"
