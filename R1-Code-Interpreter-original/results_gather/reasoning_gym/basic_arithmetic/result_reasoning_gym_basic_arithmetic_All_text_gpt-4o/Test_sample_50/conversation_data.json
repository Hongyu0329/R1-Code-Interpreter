    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-4114 + -1459 + -8906\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to add three negative integers: \\(-4114\\), \\(-1459\\), and \\(-8906\\).\n\n2. **Addition of Negative Numbers**: When adding negative numbers, the result is also negative. The sum of negative numbers is equivalent to adding their absolute values and then applying a negative sign to the result.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum**:\n   - First, add the first two numbers: \\(-4114\\) and \\(-1459\\).\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(4114 + 1459 = 5573\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, the result is \\(-5573\\).\n\n   - Next, add the result to the third number: \\(-5573 + -8906\\).\n     - Calculate the absolute values: \\(5573 + 8906 = 14479\\).\n     - Since both numbers are negative, the result is \\(-14479\\).\n\n4. **Final Result**: The sum of \\(-4114\\), \\(-1459\\), and \\(-8906\\) is \\(-14479\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-14479>>>"
