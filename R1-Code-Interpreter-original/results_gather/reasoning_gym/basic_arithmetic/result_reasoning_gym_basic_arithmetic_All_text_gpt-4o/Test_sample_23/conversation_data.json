    "To calculate 90 * 92, we can break down the multiplication into simpler steps using the distributive property of multiplication over addition. This property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. Here's how we can apply it:\n\n1. **Break down the numbers:**\n   - We can express 92 as (90 + 2).\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property:**\n   - 90 * 92 = 90 * (90 + 2).\n\n3. **Distribute the multiplication:**\n   - This becomes (90 * 90) + (90 * 2).\n\n4. **Calculate each part:**\n   - First, calculate 90 * 90:\n     - 90 * 90 = 8100.\n   - Next, calculate 90 * 2:\n     - 90 * 2 = 180.\n\n5. **Add the results:**\n   - Now, add the two results together:\n   - 8100 + 180 = 8280.\n\nBy following these steps, we have calculated the product of 90 and 92.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<8280>>>"
