    "To solve the problem of calculating \\( 9288 - 9128 \\), we will break it down into a series of careful steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to subtract two numbers: 9128 from 9288.\n\n2. **Align the Numbers**: Write the numbers one below the other, aligning them by their place values (thousands, hundreds, tens, and units).\n\n   ```\n   9288\n  -9128\n   ```\n\n3. **Subtract Digit by Digit**: Start subtracting from the rightmost digit (units) and move to the leftmost digit (thousands).\n\n   - **Units Place**: Subtract the units digit of the second number from the units digit of the first number.\n     \\[\n     8 - 8 = 0\n     \\]\n\n   - **Tens Place**: Subtract the tens digit of the second number from the tens digit of the first number.\n     \\[\n     8 - 2 = 6\n     \\]\n\n   - **Hundreds Place**: Subtract the hundreds digit of the second number from the hundreds digit of the first number.\n     \\[\n     2 - 1 = 1\n     \\]\n\n   - **Thousands Place**: Subtract the thousands digit of the second number from the thousands digit of the first number.\n     \\[\n     9 - 9 = 0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results**: Combine the results of each place value subtraction to get the final answer.\n   - Thousands: 0\n   - Hundreds: 1\n   - Tens: 6\n   - Units: 0\n\n   Therefore, the result of the subtraction is 160.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check each step to ensure there are no errors in subtraction.\n\nThe final answer to the subtraction problem \\( 9288 - 9128 \\) is:\n\n<<<160>>>"
