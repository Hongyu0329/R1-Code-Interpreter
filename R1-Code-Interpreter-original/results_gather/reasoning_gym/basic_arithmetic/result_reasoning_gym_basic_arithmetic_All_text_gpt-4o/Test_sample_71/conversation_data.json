    "To solve the expression \\( 55 + -13 \\times -69 - -78 + -43 \\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify and perform multiplication first:**\n   - The multiplication in the expression is \\(-13 \\times -69\\).\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - \\(-13 \\times -69 = 897\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\( 55 + 897 - -78 + -43 \\).\n\n3. **Handle the subtraction of a negative number:**\n   - Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive of that number.\n   - \\(- -78\\) becomes \\(+ 78\\).\n\n4. **Substitute this into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\( 55 + 897 + 78 + -43 \\).\n\n5. **Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:**\n   - Start with \\( 55 + 897 = 952\\).\n   - Then add \\( 78\\): \\( 952 + 78 = 1030\\).\n   - Finally, add \\(-43\\): \\( 1030 + (-43) = 987\\).\n\nThe final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<987>>>"
