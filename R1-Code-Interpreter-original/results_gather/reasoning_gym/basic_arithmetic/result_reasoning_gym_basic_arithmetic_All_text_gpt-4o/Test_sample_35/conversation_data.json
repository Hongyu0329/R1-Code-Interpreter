    "To solve the problem of calculating \\((-1 + -8)\\), we will break it down into clear steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers involved in the calculation are \\(-1\\) and \\(-8\\).\n\n2. **Understand the Operation**: The operation between the numbers is addition. However, both numbers are negative.\n\n3. **Addition of Negative Numbers**: When adding two negative numbers, the result is also negative. The magnitude of the result is the sum of the magnitudes of the two numbers.\n\n4. **Calculate the Magnitude**: \n   - The magnitude of \\(-1\\) is \\(1\\).\n   - The magnitude of \\(-8\\) is \\(8\\).\n   - Sum of the magnitudes: \\(1 + 8 = 9\\).\n\n5. **Determine the Sign**: Since both numbers are negative, the result will also be negative.\n\n6. **Combine the Sign and Magnitude**: The result is \\(-9\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the calculation \\((-1 + -8)\\) is:\n\n<<<-9>>>"
