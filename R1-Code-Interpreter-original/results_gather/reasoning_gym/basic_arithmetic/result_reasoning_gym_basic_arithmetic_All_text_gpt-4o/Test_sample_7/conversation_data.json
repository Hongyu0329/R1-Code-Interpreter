    "To solve the expression \\(-548 - 493 + 386\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   - The expression consists of three numbers: \\(-548\\), \\(-493\\), and \\(+386\\).\n   - We need to perform subtraction and addition operations.\n\n2. **Perform the First Operation:**\n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\(-548\\) and \\(-493\\).\n   - Since both numbers are negative, we add their absolute values and keep the result negative.\n   - Absolute values: \\(548\\) and \\(493\\).\n   - Add the absolute values: \\(548 + 493 = 1041\\).\n   - The result is negative: \\(-1041\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Second Operation:**\n   - Now, take the result from the first operation and add \\(386\\).\n   - The expression is now \\(-1041 + 386\\).\n   - Since one number is negative and the other is positive, we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value.\n   - Absolute values: \\(1041\\) and \\(386\\).\n   - Subtract the smaller from the larger: \\(1041 - 386 = 655\\).\n   - Since the larger absolute value was from the negative number, the result is negative: \\(-655\\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\(-548 - 493 + 386\\) is \\(-655\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<-655>>>"
