    "To solve the expression \\( 439 \\times \\left( \\frac{245}{7} \\right) \\), we will break it down into steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Division\nFirst, we need to simplify the division inside the parentheses: \\( \\frac{245}{7} \\).\n\n- **Division**: Divide 245 by 7.\n  - 245 divided by 7 equals 35 because:\n    - 7 goes into 24 three times (since 7 x 3 = 21), leaving a remainder of 3.\n    - Bring down the next digit, 5, making it 35.\n    - 7 goes into 35 exactly five times (since 7 x 5 = 35), with no remainder.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{245}{7} = 35 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Multiply the Result\nNow, we need to multiply the result from Step 1 by 439: \\( 439 \\times 35 \\).\n\n- **Multiplication**: Multiply 439 by 35.\n  - Break it down into smaller parts using the distributive property:\n    - \\( 439 \\times 35 = 439 \\times (30 + 5) \\)\n    - Calculate \\( 439 \\times 30 \\):\n      - \\( 439 \\times 30 = 439 \\times 3 \\times 10 \\)\n      - \\( 439 \\times 3 = 1317 \\) (since 439 + 439 + 439 = 1317)\n      - \\( 1317 \\times 10 = 13170 \\)\n    - Calculate \\( 439 \\times 5 \\):\n      - \\( 439 \\times 5 = 2195 \\) (since 439 + 439 + 439 + 439 + 439 = 2195)\n    - Add the two results together:\n      - \\( 13170 + 2195 = 15365 \\)\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter performing the calculations, the final result of the expression \\( 439 \\times \\left( \\frac{245}{7} \\right) \\) is 15365.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<15365>>>"
