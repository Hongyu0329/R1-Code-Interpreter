    "To solve the problem of calculating \\(-294 + 735\\), we can break it down into a series of careful steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to add two numbers, one of which is negative (-294) and the other is positive (735).\n\n2. **Identify the Operation**: The operation involved is addition, but since one number is negative, it is effectively a subtraction problem: \\(735 - 294\\).\n\n3. **Align the Numbers**: For clarity, align the numbers vertically as you would in a subtraction problem:\n\n   ```\n     735\n   - 294\n   ```\n\n4. **Subtract Digit by Digit**:\n   - **Units Place**: Subtract the units digit of 294 from the units digit of 735. \n     - 5 (from 735) - 4 (from 294) = 1.\n   - **Tens Place**: Subtract the tens digit of 294 from the tens digit of 735.\n     - 3 (from 735) - 9 (from 294) requires borrowing. Borrow 1 from the hundreds place of 735, making it 6, and add 10 to the tens place, making it 13.\n     - 13 - 9 = 4.\n   - **Hundreds Place**: Subtract the hundreds digit of 294 from the hundreds digit of 735.\n     - 6 (from 735, after borrowing) - 2 (from 294) = 4.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**: The result of the subtraction is 441.\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check each step to ensure no mistakes were made in borrowing or subtraction.\n\n7. **Interpret the Result**: Since we were adding a negative number to a positive number, the result is positive, as expected, because the positive number (735) is larger in magnitude than the negative number (-294).\n\nThe final answer to the calculation \\(-294 + 735\\) is:\n\n<<<441>>>"
