    "To solve the expression \\(-146 \\times 663 - 430\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is multiplication before subtraction. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(-146 \\times 663\\).\n   - First, multiply 146 by 663.\n   - Break down the multiplication for easier calculation:\n     - \\(146 \\times 663 = 146 \\times (600 + 60 + 3)\\).\n     - Calculate each part separately:\n       - \\(146 \\times 600 = 87600\\).\n       - \\(146 \\times 60 = 8760\\).\n       - \\(146 \\times 3 = 438\\).\n     - Add these results together:\n       - \\(87600 + 8760 + 438 = 96898\\).\n   - Since the original number was \\(-146\\), the result of the multiplication is \\(-96898\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction**: Now subtract 430 from \\(-96898\\).\n   - \\(-96898 - 430 = -97328\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(-146 \\times 663 - 430\\) is:\n\n<<<-97328>>>"
