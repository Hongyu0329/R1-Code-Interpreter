    "To solve the expression \\(0 + -2 + -4 \\times 0 \\times 3\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify operations**: The expression contains addition and multiplication.\n\n2. **Order of operations**: According to PEMDAS, we perform multiplication before addition.\n\n3. **Perform multiplication**:\n   - The multiplication part of the expression is \\(-4 \\times 0 \\times 3\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(-4 \\times 0\\):\n     \\[\n     -4 \\times 0 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the result by 3:\n     \\[\n     0 \\times 3 = 0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute back into the expression**: Replace the multiplication part with the result:\n   \\[\n   0 + -2 + 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform addition**:\n   - First, calculate \\(0 + -2\\):\n     \\[\n     0 + -2 = -2\n     \\]\n   - Then, add the result to 0:\n     \\[\n     -2 + 0 = -2\n     \\]\n\nThe final result of the expression is \\(-2\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2>>>"
