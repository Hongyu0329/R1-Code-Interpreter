    "To solve the expression \\(-( -( -1 - -7 ) ) - 3\\), we need to carefully evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. **Inner Parentheses**: Start with the innermost expression, which is \\(-1 - -7\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(-1 - -7\\) becomes \\(-1 + 7\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-1 + 7\\), which equals \\(6\\).\n\n2. **First Negation**: Now, evaluate the expression with the first negation: \\(-(6)\\).\n   - The negative of \\(6\\) is \\(-6\\).\n\n3. **Second Negation**: Next, apply the second negation: \\(-(-6)\\).\n   - The negative of \\(-6\\) is \\(6\\).\n\n4. **Subtraction**: Finally, subtract \\(3\\) from the result of the second negation.\n   - Calculate \\(6 - 3\\), which equals \\(3\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
