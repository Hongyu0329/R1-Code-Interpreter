    "To calculate \\( 575 \\div 5 \\), we can break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Division**: We are dividing 575 by 5. This means we want to find out how many times 5 fits into 575.\n\n2. **Estimate the Quotient**: Start by estimating how many times 5 goes into the first few digits of 575.\n   - 5 goes into 57 (the first two digits of 575) approximately 11 times because \\( 5 \\times 11 = 55 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Remainder**: Subtract 55 from 57 to find the remainder.\n   - \\( 57 - 55 = 2 \\).\n\n4. **Bring Down the Next Digit**: Bring down the next digit from 575, which is 5, making the new number 25.\n\n5. **Divide Again**: Now, divide 25 by 5.\n   - 5 goes into 25 exactly 5 times because \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\).\n\n6. **Check for Remainder**: Subtract 25 from 25 to find the remainder.\n   - \\( 25 - 25 = 0 \\).\n\n7. **Combine the Quotients**: The results from the two divisions are 11 and 5. Combine these to get the final quotient.\n   - The quotient is 115.\n\n8. **Verify the Result**: Multiply the quotient by the divisor to ensure the product equals the original dividend.\n   - \\( 115 \\times 5 = 575 \\), which matches the original number, confirming the division is correct.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the result of the division.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<115>>>"
