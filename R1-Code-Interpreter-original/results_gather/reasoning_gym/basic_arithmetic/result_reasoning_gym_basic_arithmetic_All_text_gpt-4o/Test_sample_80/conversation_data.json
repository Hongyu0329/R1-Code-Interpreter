    "To solve the expression \\(-( 78 - -944 / 118 + 493 ) / 3\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the expression inside the parentheses**: \n   \\[\n   78 - \\frac{-944}{118} + 493\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the division inside the parentheses**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{-944}{118}\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(-944 \\div 118\\):\n   - \\(-944 \\div 118 \\approx -8\\)\n   - Therefore, \\(\\frac{-944}{118} = -8\\).\n\n3. **Substitute the division result back into the expression**:\n   \\[\n   78 - (-8) + 493\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the expression by handling the subtraction of a negative number**:\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive:\n   \\[\n   78 + 8 + 493\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the addition**:\n   - First, add \\(78 + 8\\):\n     \\[\n     78 + 8 = 86\n     \\]\n   - Then, add \\(86 + 493\\):\n     \\[\n     86 + 493 = 579\n     \\]\n\n6. **Substitute back into the original expression**:\n   \\[\n   -(579) / 3\n   \\]\n\n7. **Perform the division**:\n   - Calculate \\(579 \\div 3\\):\n     \\[\n     579 \\div 3 = 193\n     \\]\n\n8. **Apply the negative sign**:\n   \\[\n   -193\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-193>>>"
