    "To solve the expression \\(-530 + 807 - -253 + -131 - -301 + -802\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations and pay attention to the signs of each number. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms and their signs:**\n   - \\(-530\\)\n   - \\(+ 807\\)\n   - \\(- -253\\) which is equivalent to \\(+ 253\\)\n   - \\(+ -131\\) which is equivalent to \\(- 131\\)\n   - \\(- -301\\) which is equivalent to \\(+ 301\\)\n   - \\(+ -802\\) which is equivalent to \\(- 802\\)\n\n2. **Re-write the expression with simplified signs:**\n   \\[\n   -530 + 807 + 253 - 131 + 301 - 802\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:**\n\n   - Start with the first two terms: \n     \\[\n     -530 + 807 = 277\n     \\]\n\n   - Add the next term:\n     \\[\n     277 + 253 = 530\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract the next term:\n     \\[\n     530 - 131 = 399\n     \\]\n\n   - Add the next term:\n     \\[\n     399 + 301 = 700\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract the last term:\n     \\[\n     700 - 802 = -102\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(-102\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<-102>>>}\n\\]"
