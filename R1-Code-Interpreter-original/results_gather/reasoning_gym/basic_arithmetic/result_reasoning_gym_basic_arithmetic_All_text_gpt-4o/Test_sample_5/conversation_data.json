  "response_list": [
    "To solve the expression \\(-(2 - 7 + 5 \\times 0 - 4) / 1\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\(2 - 7 + 5 \\times 0 - 4\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Within the parentheses, perform the multiplication first:\n   - \\(5 \\times 0 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Substitute back into the expression**: Replace \\(5 \\times 0\\) with \\(0\\) in the parentheses:\n   - \\(2 - 7 + 0 - 4\\).\n\n4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform the operations from left to right:\n   - \\(2 - 7 = -5\\),\n   - \\(-5 + 0 = -5\\),\n   - \\(-5 - 4 = -9\\).\n\n5. **Negation**: The expression now is \\(-(-9)\\). The negative sign outside the parentheses negates the result inside:\n   - \\(-(-9) = 9\\).\n\n6. **Division**: Finally, divide by 1:\n   - \\(9 / 1 = 9\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
