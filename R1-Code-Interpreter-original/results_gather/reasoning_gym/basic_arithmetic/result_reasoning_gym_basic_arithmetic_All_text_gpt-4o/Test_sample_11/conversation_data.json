    "To calculate \\(965 \\div 5\\), we can break down the division process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Division**: We are dividing 965 by 5. This means we want to find out how many times 5 fits into 965.\n\n2. **Estimate the Quotient**: Start by estimating how many times 5 goes into the first few digits of 965. \n\n3. **Divide Step by Step**:\n   - **First Digit**: Look at the first digit of 965, which is 9. Determine how many times 5 fits into 9. It fits 1 time because \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\).\n   - **Subtract and Bring Down**: Subtract 5 from 9, which gives 4. Bring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 46.\n   - **Second Digit**: Determine how many times 5 fits into 46. It fits 9 times because \\(5 \\times 9 = 45\\).\n   - **Subtract and Bring Down**: Subtract 45 from 46, which gives 1. Bring down the next digit, which is 5, making it 15.\n   - **Third Digit**: Determine how many times 5 fits into 15. It fits 3 times because \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n   - **Subtract**: Subtract 15 from 15, which gives 0.\n\n4. **Combine the Quotients**: The numbers we found (1, 9, and 3) form the quotient. Therefore, the quotient of 965 divided by 5 is 193.\n\n5. **Verify the Result**: Multiply the quotient by the divisor to ensure the product equals the dividend:\n   - \\(193 \\times 5 = 965\\), which matches the original number, confirming our division is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<193>>>"
