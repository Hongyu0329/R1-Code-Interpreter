    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Sarah's friends. Sarah has 3 male friends and 3 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Sarah's group consists of 3 male friends and 3 female friends.\n2. Michael is one of the male friends.\n3. Since all friends are friends with each other, Michael is friends with all the female friends in the group.\n\nTherefore, Michael, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 3 female friends of Sarah.\n\nNow, let's confirm this understanding with a simple calculation using Python code to ensure our logic is correct.\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends\nmale_friends = 3\nfemale_friends = 3\n\n# Michael is one of the male friends\n# Since all friends are friends with each other, Michael is friends with all female friends\nmichaels_female_friends = female_friends\n\nprint(michaels_female_friends)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the number of female friends Michael has.",
    "The code execution confirms that Michael, being one of Sarah's male friends, has 3 female friends. This is consistent with the understanding that all friends in Sarah's group are friends with each other.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 3 male friends and she also has 3 female friends.
