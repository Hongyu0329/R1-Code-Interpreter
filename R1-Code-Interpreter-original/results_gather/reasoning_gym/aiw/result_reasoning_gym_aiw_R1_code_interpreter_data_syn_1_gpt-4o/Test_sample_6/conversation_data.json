    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Susan, her friends, and John's friends.\n\n1. Susan has 1 male friend and 3 female friends.\n2. All of Susan's friends are friends with each other.\n3. John is the male friend of Susan.\n\nSince all of Susan's friends are friends with each other, John's friends include all of Susan's friends except himself. Therefore, John's friends are the 3 female friends of Susan.\n\nLet's calculate this using a simple Python script to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends Susan has\nmale_friends = 1\nfemale_friends = 3\n\n# Since John is the male friend, his female friends are all of Susan's female friends\njohn_female_friends = female_friends\n\nprint(john_female_friends)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find out how many female friends John has.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `3`, which means John, the male friend of Susan, has 3 female friends. This is consistent with the problem statement that all of Susan's friends are friends with each other.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
