    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Sarah's friends. Sarah has 2 male friends and 4 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Sarah's group of friends consists of 2 males and 4 females, making a total of 6 friends.\n2. John is one of the male friends.\n3. Since all friends are friends with each other, John is friends with all the other friends in the group.\n4. Therefore, John is friends with the 4 female friends of Sarah.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python code to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends\nmale_friends = 2\nfemale_friends = 4\n\n# Total number of friends\ntotal_friends = male_friends + female_friends\n\n# Since John is one of the male friends, he is friends with all the other friends\n# Therefore, the number of female friends John has is equal to the number of female friends in the group\njohn_female_friends = female_friends\n\nprint(john_female_friends)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the number of female friends John has.",
    "The code output confirms that John, one of Sarah's male friends, has 4 female friends. This is because all of Sarah's friends are friends with each other, and there are 4 female friends in the group.\n\n<<<4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 2 male friends and she also has 4 female friends.
