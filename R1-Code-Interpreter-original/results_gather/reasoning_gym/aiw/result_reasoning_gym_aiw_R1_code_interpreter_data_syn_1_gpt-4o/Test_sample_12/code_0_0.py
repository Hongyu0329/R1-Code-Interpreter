# Number of male and female friends
male_friends = 2
female_friends = 4

# Total number of friends
total_friends = male_friends + female_friends

# Since John is one of the male friends, he is friends with all the other friends
# Therefore, the number of female friends John has is equal to the number of female friends in the group
