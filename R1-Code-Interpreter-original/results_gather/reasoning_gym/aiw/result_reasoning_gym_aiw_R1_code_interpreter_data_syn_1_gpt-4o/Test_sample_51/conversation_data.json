    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Jessica's friends. Jessica has 2 male friends and 4 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means that each of Jessica's male friends is also friends with all of Jessica's female friends.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Jessica has 2 male friends: John and another male friend.\n2. Jessica has 4 female friends.\n3. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n\nSince John is one of the male friends and all of Jessica's friends are friends with each other, John is friends with all 4 of Jessica's female friends.\n\nTherefore, John has 4 female friends.\n\n<<<4>>>"
