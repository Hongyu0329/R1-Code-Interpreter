  "question": "Jessica has 6 male colleagues and she also has 1 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jessica has. All these mentioned persons around Jessica are colleagues of each other. Michael has 5 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Michael and she is also colleague of Jessica, being part of Jessica's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Jessica and Michael, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Jessica's Circle:**\n   - Jessica has 6 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Jessica's circle = 6 males + 1 female = 7 colleagues.\n   - Including Jessica herself, the total number of people in her circle is 8.\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - Michael has 5 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Michael's circle = 5 males + 6 females = 11 colleagues.\n   - Including Michael himself, the total number of people in his circle is 12.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jessica and Michael.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Finding Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is part of Jessica's circle, which has 1 female colleague (excluding Matilda herself).\n   - Matilda is part of Michael's circle, which has 6 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in Michael's circle, we need to exclude her from the count of female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and the unique female colleagues in each circle.\n\n```python\n# Jessica's circle\njessica_female_colleagues = 1  # excluding Matilda\n\n# Michael's circle\nmichael_female_colleagues = 6  # including Matilda\n\n# Matilda's female colleagues\n# Matilda is part of both circles, so we need to consider the unique female colleagues\n# in Michael's circle excluding Matilda herself\nmatilda_female_colleagues = jessica_female_colleagues + (michael_female_colleagues - 1)\n\nprint(matilda_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Matilda has 6 female colleagues. This result is derived from the following reasoning:\n\n- In Jessica's circle, there is 1 female colleague (excluding Matilda).\n- In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, but this count includes Matilda herself.\n- Therefore, Matilda's female colleagues are the 1 female from Jessica's circle plus the 5 other females from Michael's circle (excluding Matilda).\n\nThus, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
