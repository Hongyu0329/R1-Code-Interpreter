  "question": "Patricia has 1 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Patricia has. All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. Robert has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Robert are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Robert do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Patricia and Robert, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Patricia's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 5 female colleagues\n   - Total: 1 + 5 = 6 colleagues\n\n2. **Robert's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 3 + 3 = 6 colleagues\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and Robert.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Understanding the Overlap:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Patricia and Robert, she is counted in both circles.\n   - Therefore, the total number of unique individuals in both circles is 6 (Patricia's circle) + 6 (Robert's circle) - 1 (Matilda, counted twice) = 11 unique individuals.\n\n5. **Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Patricia's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - In Robert's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n   - Matilda is counted in both circles, so we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- Matilda is one of the female colleagues in both circles.\n- In Patricia's circle, excluding Matilda, there are 4 other female colleagues.\n- In Robert's circle, excluding Matilda, there are 2 other female colleagues.\n\nThus, Matilda has 4 (from Patricia's circle) + 2 (from Robert's circle) = 6 female colleagues.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Patricia's circle\npatricia_female_colleagues = 5\n\n# Robert's circle\nrobert_female_colleagues = 3\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles\n# Excluding Matilda from each circle\nmatilda_female_colleagues = (patricia_female_colleagues - 1) + (robert_female_colleagues - 1)\n\nprint(matilda_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution confirms that Matilda has 6 female colleagues. \n\n<<<6>>>"
