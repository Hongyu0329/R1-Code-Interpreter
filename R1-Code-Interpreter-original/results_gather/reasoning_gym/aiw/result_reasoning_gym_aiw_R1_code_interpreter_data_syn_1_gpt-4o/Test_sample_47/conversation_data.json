    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the family structure described:\n\n1. Barbara has 2 brothers.\n2. Barbara has 2 sisters.\n\nThe question asks how many sisters Barbara's brother has.\n\n- Since Barbara is one of the sisters, and she has 2 sisters, this means there are 3 sisters in total (including Barbara herself).\n- Barbara's brothers would have the same number of sisters as Barbara does because they are all siblings.\n\nTherefore, Barbara's brothers have 3 sisters.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Barbara has\nbarbara_sisters = 2\n\n# Including Barbara herself, the total number of sisters\ntotal_sisters = barbara_sisters + 1\n\n# Output the number of sisters Barbara's brother has\nprint(total_sisters)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of sisters Barbara's brother has.",
    "The code executed correctly and confirmed that Barbara's brother has 3 sisters. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
