  "question": "Sarah has 2 male colleagues and she also has 1 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. James has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and connections between Sarah's and James's circles of colleagues, considering the shared colleague Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 2 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 2 males + 1 female = 3 colleagues.\n   - Including Sarah herself, the total number of people in Sarah's circle = 3 colleagues + Sarah = 4 people.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in James's circle = 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues.\n   - Including James himself, the total number of people in James's circle = 7 colleagues + James = 8 people.\n\n3. **Shared Colleague - Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and James.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is part of James's circle, which has 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is one of these female colleagues, we need to determine how many other female colleagues she has in James's circle.\n\nLet's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has in James's circle by excluding Matilda herself from the count of female colleagues in James's circle.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in James's circle\ntotal_female_colleagues_in_james_circle = 3\n\n# Matilda is one of the female colleagues\n# Therefore, the number of other female colleagues Matilda has\nfemale_colleagues_of_matilda = total_female_colleagues_in_james_circle - 1\n\nprint(female_colleagues_of_matilda)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Matilda has 2 female colleagues in James's circle, excluding herself. This is because James's circle has 3 female colleagues in total, and since Matilda is one of them, the remaining female colleagues are 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
