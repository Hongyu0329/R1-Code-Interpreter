    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Linda has 6 male friends and 5 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Linda has 6 male friends, including Bob.\n2. Linda has 5 female friends.\n3. All of Linda's friends are friends with each other.\n\nSince Bob is one of the 6 male friends, he is friends with all the other male friends and all the female friends. Therefore, Bob is friends with all 5 of Linda's female friends.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple calculation:\n\n- Total number of friends Linda has = 6 male + 5 female = 11 friends.\n- Bob, being one of the male friends, is friends with the remaining 10 friends (5 male + 5 female).\n\nThus, Bob has 5 female friends.\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to verify this:\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends\nmale_friends = 6\nfemale_friends = 5\n\n# Bob is one of the male friends\n# Therefore, he is friends with all the female friends\nbob_female_friends = female_friends\n\nprint(bob_female_friends)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of female friends Bob has.",
    "The code executed correctly and returned the expected output. This confirms that Bob, one of Linda's male friends, has 5 female friends. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 6 male friends and she also has 5 female friends.
