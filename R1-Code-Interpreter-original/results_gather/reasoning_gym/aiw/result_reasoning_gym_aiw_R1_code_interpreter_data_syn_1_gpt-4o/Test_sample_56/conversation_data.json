    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the social network described. Linda has 2 male friends and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Linda has 2 male friends and 6 female friends.\n2. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n3. David is one of the male friends.\n\nSince all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, David, being one of the male friends, is also friends with all of Linda's female friends. Therefore, David has 6 female friends.\n\nNow, let's confirm this understanding with a simple calculation or logic check using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends Linda has\nmale_friends = 2\nfemale_friends = 6\n\n# Since all friends are friends with each other, each male friend, including David, has all the female friends\ndavid_female_friends = female_friends\n\n# Output the number of female friends David has\nprint(david_female_friends)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the number of female friends David has.",
    "The code execution confirms that David, one of Linda's male friends, has 6 female friends. This is because all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, and thus David is friends with all 6 of Linda's female friends.\n\n<<<6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 2 male friends and she also has 6 female friends.
