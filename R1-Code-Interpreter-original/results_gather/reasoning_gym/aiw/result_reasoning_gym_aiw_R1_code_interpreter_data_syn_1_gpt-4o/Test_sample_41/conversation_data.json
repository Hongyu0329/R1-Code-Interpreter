    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Sarah and Joseph. The problem states that Sarah has 2 sisters and 5 brothers. However, it does not provide any direct information about Joseph's family or his relationship to Sarah.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. Sarah has 2 sisters. This means there are 3 sisters in total, including Sarah.\n2. Sarah has 5 brothers.\n\nThe question asks how many sisters Joseph's brother has. To answer this, we need to determine if Joseph is one of Sarah's brothers. If Joseph is one of Sarah's brothers, then Joseph's brother (which could be Joseph himself or another brother) would have the same number of sisters as Sarah's brothers do.\n\nSince the problem does not provide any additional information about Joseph, we will assume that Joseph is one of Sarah's brothers. Therefore, Joseph's brother would have the same number of sisters as Sarah's brothers.\n\nThus, Joseph's brother would have 3 sisters.\n\n<<<3>>>"
