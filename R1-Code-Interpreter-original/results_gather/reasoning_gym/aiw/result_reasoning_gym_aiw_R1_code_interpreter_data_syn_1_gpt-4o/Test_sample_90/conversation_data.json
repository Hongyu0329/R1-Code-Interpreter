    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Margaret's friends. Margaret has 1 male friend and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends aside from this group.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Margaret's male friend is William.\n2. William is friends with all of Margaret's friends, which includes 6 female friends and Margaret herself.\n3. Since the problem states that they are all friends with each other, William is friends with all 6 female friends.\n\nTherefore, William has 6 female friends.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends Margaret has\nmale_friends = 1\nfemale_friends = 6\n\n# Since all friends are friends with each other, William, the male friend, is friends with all female friends\nwilliam_female_friends = female_friends\n\nprint(william_female_friends)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of female friends William has.",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning. William, the male friend of Margaret, has 6 female friends. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
