  "question": "Linda has 4 male colleagues and she also has 2 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. David has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around David are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around David do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of David and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the number of colleagues in the circles around Linda and David, considering the overlap due to Matilda.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 4 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 4 males + 2 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n2. **David's Circle:**\n   - David has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in David's circle = 4 males + 4 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Linda and David.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both Linda's and David's circles.\n\n4. **Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has.\n   - In Linda's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n   - In David's circle, there are 4 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n\nLet's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and the unique female colleagues in each circle.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle\nfemale_colleagues_linda = 2\n\n# Number of female colleagues in David's circle\nfemale_colleagues_david = 4\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we need to find the unique female colleagues\n# Matilda is one of the female colleagues in both circles\n# Therefore, the unique female colleagues Matilda has are:\nunique_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_linda + female_colleagues_david - 1  # Subtracting Matilda herself\n\nprint(unique_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Matilda has 5 female colleagues. This result is derived from the following reasoning:\n\n- Linda's circle has 2 female colleagues.\n- David's circle has 4 female colleagues.\n- Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to account for her being counted twice.\n\nThus, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 4 male colleagues and she also has 2 female colleagues.
