  "question": "Linda has 5 male colleagues and she also has 1 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. John has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Linda and John, and how they intersect through Matilda.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 5 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Including Linda herself, the total number of people in Linda's circle is 7 (5 males + 1 female + Linda).\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - John has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Including John himself, the total number of people in John's circle is 9 (3 males + 5 females + John).\n\n3. **Intersection through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and John.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the females in both circles:\n\n- **Females in Linda's Circle:**\n  - There is 1 female colleague (excluding Linda herself).\n\n- **Females in John's Circle:**\n  - There are 5 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, she will count the females from both circles. However, we need to ensure we don't double-count Matilda herself if she is included in the count of female colleagues in John's circle.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the females in both circles, excluding Matilda herself.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle (excluding Linda herself)\nfemales_in_lindas_circle = 1\n\n# Number of female colleagues in John's circle\nfemales_in_johns_circle = 5\n\n# Total number of female colleagues Matilda has\n# Matilda is not counted as her own colleague\ntotal_female_colleagues = females_in_lindas_circle + females_in_johns_circle\n\nprint(total_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Matilda has 6 female colleagues. This result is derived from the sum of female colleagues in both Linda's and John's circles, excluding Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
