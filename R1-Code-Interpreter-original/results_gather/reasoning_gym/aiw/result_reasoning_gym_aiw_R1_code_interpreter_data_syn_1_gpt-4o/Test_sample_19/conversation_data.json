    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the family structure described:\n\n1. Sarah has 2 brothers.\n2. Sarah has 2 sisters.\n\nWe are asked to find out how many sisters Sarah's brother has.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Sarah is one of the sisters.\n- Sarah has 2 sisters, which means there are 3 sisters in total (including Sarah herself).\n- Each of Sarah's brothers will have the same number of sisters as Sarah does, because they are all siblings.\n\nTherefore, each of Sarah's brothers will have 3 sisters.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 2 brothers and she also has 2 sisters.
