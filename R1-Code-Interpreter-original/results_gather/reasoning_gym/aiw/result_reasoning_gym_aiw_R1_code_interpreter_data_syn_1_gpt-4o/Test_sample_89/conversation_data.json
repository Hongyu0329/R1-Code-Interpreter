    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Margaret's brother has. \n\n1. We know that Margaret has 6 brothers and 2 sisters.\n2. Since Margaret is one of the sisters, the total number of sisters is 2.\n3. Each of Margaret's brothers will have the same number of sisters as Margaret does, because they are all siblings.\n\nTherefore, each of Margaret's brothers will have 2 sisters.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Margaret has\nmargaret_sisters = 2\n\n# Number of sisters Margaret's brother has\nbrothers_sisters = margaret_sisters\n\nprint(brothers_sisters)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of sisters each of Margaret's brothers has.",
    "The code output confirms that each of Margaret's brothers has 2 sisters. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
