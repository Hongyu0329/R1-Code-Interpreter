    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Jessica and Robert. The problem states that Jessica has 4 sisters and 6 brothers. It does not explicitly mention Robert, but we can infer that Robert is one of Jessica's brothers.\n\nSince Jessica has 4 sisters, this means there are 5 girls in total (including Jessica herself). Since Robert is one of Jessica's brothers, he shares the same number of sisters as Jessica does.\n\nTherefore, Robert's brother (which could be Robert himself or any of his other brothers) would also have the same number of sisters as Jessica.\n\nLet's calculate the number of sisters Robert's brother has:\n\n- Jessica has 4 sisters.\n- Therefore, Robert's brother also has 4 sisters.\n\nThe final answer is straightforward, and we don't need to write any code for this simple arithmetic problem.\n\n<<<4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jessica has 4 sisters and she also has 6 brothers.
