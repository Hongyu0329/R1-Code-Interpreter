  "question": "Sarah has 3 male colleagues and she also has 1 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. John has 3 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Sarah and John, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 3 males + 1 female = 4 colleagues.\n   - Including Sarah, the total number of people in Sarah's circle = 5.\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - John has 3 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 3 males + 2 females = 5 colleagues.\n   - Including John, the total number of people in John's circle = 6.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and John.\n   - Matilda is part of both Sarah's and John's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is in Sarah's circle, which includes 1 other female colleague (besides Matilda).\n   - Matilda is in John's circle, which includes 2 female colleagues (including Matilda herself).\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Sarah's circle, Matilda has 1 female colleague.\n- In John's circle, Matilda is one of the 2 female colleagues, so she has 1 other female colleague.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her. Therefore, Matilda has 1 female colleague from Sarah's circle and 1 female colleague from John's circle, but since Matilda herself is counted in John's circle, we only consider the other female colleague.\n\nThus, Matilda has 1 female colleague from Sarah's circle and 1 additional female colleague from John's circle, making it a total of 2 female colleagues.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 3 male colleagues and she also has 1 female colleagues.
