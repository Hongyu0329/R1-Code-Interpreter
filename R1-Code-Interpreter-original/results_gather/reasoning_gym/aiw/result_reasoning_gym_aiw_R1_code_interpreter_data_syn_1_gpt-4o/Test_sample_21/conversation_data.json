    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Linda has 5 male friends and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nSince Joseph is one of Linda's male friends, he is part of the group of 5 male friends. The problem states that all of Linda's friends are friends with each other. Therefore, Joseph, being a male friend, is friends with all of Linda's female friends.\n\nLet's calculate the number of female friends Joseph has:\n\n- Total female friends Linda has = 6\n- Since Joseph is friends with all of them, Joseph has 6 female friends.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 5 male friends and she also has 6 female friends.
