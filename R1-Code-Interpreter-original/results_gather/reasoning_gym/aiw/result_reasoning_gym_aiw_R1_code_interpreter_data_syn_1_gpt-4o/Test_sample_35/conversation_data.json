    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships and the information given:\n\n1. Susan has 3 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. We need to determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Susan has 3 sisters, it means there are 4 girls in total (including Susan herself).\n- Susan also has 4 brothers.\n- Therefore, the total number of siblings (including Susan) is 4 girls + 4 boys = 8 siblings.\n\nNow, if Joseph is one of Susan's brothers, then Joseph's brother would be one of Susan's brothers as well. Since Susan has 3 sisters, Joseph's brother would also have the same number of sisters, which is 3.\n\nThus, Joseph's brother has 3 sisters.\n\n<<<3>>>"
