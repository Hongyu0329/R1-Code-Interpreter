    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Elizabeth's friends. Elizabeth has 4 male friends and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Elizabeth has 4 male friends, including William.\n2. Elizabeth has 6 female friends.\n3. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n\nSince all of Elizabeth's friends are friends with each other, each male friend, including William, is friends with all 6 of the female friends. Therefore, William, being one of the male friends, will have 6 female friends.\n\nNow, let's confirm this understanding with a simple calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends\nmale_friends = 4\nfemale_friends = 6\n\n# Since all friends are friends with each other, each male friend has all female friends\nwilliam_female_friends = female_friends\n\nprint(william_female_friends)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the number of female friends William has.",
    "The code execution confirms that William, being one of Elizabeth's male friends, has 6 female friends. This is because all of Elizabeth's friends are friends with each other, and there are 6 female friends in total.\n\n<<<6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Elizabeth has 4 male friends and she also has 6 female friends.
