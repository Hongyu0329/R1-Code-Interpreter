    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and friendships described.\n\n1. Susan has 3 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n3. Michael is one of the male friends of Susan.\n\nLet's break down the relationships:\n- Susan's friends: 3 males (including Michael) and 1 female.\n- Since they are all friends with each other, Michael is friends with the other 2 males and the 1 female friend.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many female friends Michael has:\n- Michael is friends with Susan (female) and the 1 female friend of Susan.\n\nTherefore, Michael has 2 female friends: Susan and Susan's female friend.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the friends\nsusan_friends = {\n    \"males\": [\"Michael\", \"MaleFriend2\", \"MaleFriend3\"],\n    \"females\": [\"FemaleFriend1\"]\n}\n\n# Michael's friends\nmichael_friends = susan_friends[\"males\"] + susan_friends[\"females\"] + [\"Susan\"]\n\n# Count female friends of Michael\nfemale_friends_of_michael = [friend for friend in michael_friends if friend in susan_friends[\"females\"] or friend == \"Susan\"]\n\n# Output the number of female friends Michael has\nprint(len(female_friends_of_michael))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the number of female friends Michael has.",
    "The code execution confirms that Michael has 2 female friends. This includes Susan and Susan's female friend. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Susan has 3 male friends and she also has 1 female friends.
