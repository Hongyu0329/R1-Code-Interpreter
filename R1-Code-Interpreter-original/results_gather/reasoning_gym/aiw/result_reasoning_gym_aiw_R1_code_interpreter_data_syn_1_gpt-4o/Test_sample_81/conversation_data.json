    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Elizabeth and James. The problem states that Elizabeth has 5 sisters and 4 brothers. It does not explicitly mention James, but we can infer that James is one of Elizabeth's brothers.\n\nIf James is one of Elizabeth's brothers, then he shares the same siblings as Elizabeth. Therefore, James would have the same number of sisters as Elizabeth does.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Elizabeth has 5 sisters.\n2. Elizabeth has 4 brothers, one of whom is James.\n3. Since James is one of Elizabeth's brothers, he shares the same sisters as Elizabeth.\n\nThus, James's brother (which is James himself) would have the same number of sisters as Elizabeth.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of sisters James has:\n\n- Elizabeth has 5 sisters.\n- Therefore, James also has 5 sisters.\n\nThe final answer is that James's brother has 5 sisters.\n\n<<<5>>>"
