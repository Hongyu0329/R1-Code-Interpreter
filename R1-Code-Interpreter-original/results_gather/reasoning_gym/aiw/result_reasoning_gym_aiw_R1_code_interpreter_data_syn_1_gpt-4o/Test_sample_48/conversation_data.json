    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described.\n\n1. Sarah has 3 sisters. This means there are 4 sisters in total, including Sarah herself.\n2. Sarah also has 3 brothers.\n\nNow, let's consider Richard. The problem states \"Richard's brother.\" Since Richard is one of Sarah's brothers, Richard's brother is also one of Sarah's brothers. Therefore, Richard's brother is one of the 3 brothers mentioned.\n\nThe question asks how many sisters Richard's brother has. Since Richard's brother is one of Sarah's brothers, he shares the same number of sisters as Sarah does.\n\nTherefore, Richard's brother has the same number of sisters as Sarah, which is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
