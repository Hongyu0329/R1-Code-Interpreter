    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Susan's friends. Susan has 4 male friends and 5 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means that each male friend, including Thomas, is friends with all of Susan's female friends.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Susan has 4 male friends: Thomas and 3 others.\n2. Susan has 5 female friends.\n3. All of Susan's friends are friends with each other.\n\nSince Thomas is one of the male friends and all of Susan's friends are friends with each other, Thomas is friends with all 5 of Susan's female friends.\n\nTherefore, Thomas has 5 female friends.\n\n<<<5>>>"
