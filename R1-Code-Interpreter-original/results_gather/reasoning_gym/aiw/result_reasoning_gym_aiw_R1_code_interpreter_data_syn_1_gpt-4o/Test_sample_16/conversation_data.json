    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Jennifer's friends. Jennifer has 6 male friends and 5 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Jennifer has 6 male friends, including Thomas.\n2. Jennifer has 5 female friends.\n3. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n\nSince Thomas is one of the 6 male friends, he is friends with all of Jennifer's 5 female friends. Therefore, Thomas has 5 female friends.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple calculation:\n\n- Total number of female friends Jennifer has = 5\n- Since all friends are friends with each other, Thomas, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 5 female friends.\n\nThus, Thomas has 5 female friends.\n\n<<<5>>>"
