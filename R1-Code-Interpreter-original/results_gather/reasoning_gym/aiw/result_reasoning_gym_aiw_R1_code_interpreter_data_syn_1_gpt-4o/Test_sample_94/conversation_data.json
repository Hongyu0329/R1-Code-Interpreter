    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Margaret's friends. Margaret has 4 male friends and 2 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends aside from this group.\n\nLet's break down the group:\n\n- Total number of friends Margaret has: 4 male + 2 female = 6 friends.\n- Since they are all friends with each other, each person in this group is friends with the other 5 people.\n\nNow, let's focus on Charles, one of the male friends. Since Charles is part of this group of 6 friends, he is friends with the other 5 people in the group. Out of these 5 people, 2 are female (since Margaret has 2 female friends).\n\nTherefore, Charles, being one of the male friends, will have 2 female friends.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends\nmale_friends = 4\nfemale_friends = 2\n\n# Total friends in the group\ntotal_friends = male_friends + female_friends\n\n# Friends of Charles (one of the male friends)\nfriends_of_charles = total_friends - 1  # Excluding Charles himself\n\n# Female friends of Charles\nfemale_friends_of_charles = female_friends\n\nprint(female_friends_of_charles)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of female friends Charles has.",
    "The code execution confirms that Charles, one of the male friends of Margaret, has 2 female friends. This is consistent with the understanding that all of Margaret's friends are friends with each other.\n\n<<<2>>>"
