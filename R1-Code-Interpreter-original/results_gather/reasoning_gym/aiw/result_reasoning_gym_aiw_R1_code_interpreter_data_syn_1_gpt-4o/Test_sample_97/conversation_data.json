    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Sarah, her friends, and William.\n\n1. Sarah has 1 male friend and 6 female friends.\n2. All of Sarah's friends are friends with each other.\n3. William is the male friend of Sarah.\n\nSince all of Sarah's friends are friends with each other, William, being the only male friend, is friends with all of Sarah's female friends. Therefore, William has 6 female friends.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation:\n\n- Total number of Sarah's friends = 1 male + 6 female = 7 friends.\n- Since all friends are friends with each other, William, the male friend, is friends with the 6 female friends.\n\nThus, William has 6 female friends.\n\n<<<6>>>"
