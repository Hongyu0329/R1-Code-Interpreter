  "question": "Elizabeth has 4 male colleagues and she also has 2 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Elizabeth has. All these mentioned persons around Elizabeth are colleagues of each other. Joseph has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Elizabeth, being part of Elizabeth's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Elizabeth and Joseph, and how they intersect through Matilda.\n\n1. **Elizabeth's Circle:**\n   - Elizabeth has 4 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Elizabeth's circle = 4 males + 2 females = 6 colleagues.\n   - Including Elizabeth herself, the total number of people in her circle is 7.\n\n2. **Joseph's Circle:**\n   - Joseph has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Joseph's circle = 3 males + 1 female = 4 colleagues.\n   - Including Joseph himself, the total number of people in his circle is 5.\n\n3. **Intersection through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Elizabeth and Joseph.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Elizabeth's circle, there are 2 female colleagues (excluding Elizabeth herself).\n   - In Joseph's circle, there is 1 female colleague (excluding Joseph himself).\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine if the female colleague in Joseph's circle is the same as one of the female colleagues in Elizabeth's circle or not.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If the female colleague in Joseph's circle is not one of the female colleagues in Elizabeth's circle, then Matilda has 3 female colleagues.\n   - If the female colleague in Joseph's circle is one of the female colleagues in Elizabeth's circle, then Matilda has 2 female colleagues.\n\nSince the problem does not specify any overlap of female colleagues other than Matilda herself, we will assume the female colleague in Joseph's circle is not one of the female colleagues in Elizabeth's circle.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 3 female colleagues.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Elizabeth has 4 male colleagues and she also has 2 female colleagues.
