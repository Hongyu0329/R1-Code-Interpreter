  "question": "Jessica has 6 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jessica has. All these mentioned persons around Jessica are colleagues of each other. Charles has 1 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Jessica, being part of Jessica's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Jessica and Charles, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Jessica's Circle:**\n   - Jessica has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Jessica's circle = 6 males + 3 females = 9 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Jessica's circle.\n\n2. **Charles's Circle:**\n   - Charles has 1 male colleague and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Charles's circle = 1 male + 1 female = 2 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the female colleague in Charles's circle.\n\n3. **Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the common colleague between Jessica's and Charles's circles.\n   - Matilda is counted as a female colleague in both circles.\n\n4. **Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jessica's circle, there are 3 female colleagues including Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 2 other female colleagues in Jessica's circle.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Jessica's circle\njessica_male_colleagues = 6\njessica_female_colleagues = 3\n\n# Charles's circle\ncharles_male_colleagues = 1\ncharles_female_colleagues = 1\n\n# Matilda's female colleagues in Jessica's circle\nmatilda_female_colleagues = jessica_female_colleagues - 1  # excluding Matilda herself\n\nprint(matilda_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that Matilda has 2 female colleagues in Jessica's circle, excluding herself. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jessica has 6 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues.
