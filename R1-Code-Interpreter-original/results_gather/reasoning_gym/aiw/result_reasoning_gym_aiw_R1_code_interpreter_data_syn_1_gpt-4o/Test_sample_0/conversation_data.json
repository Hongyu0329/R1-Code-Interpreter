    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Linda's brother has. \n\n1. **Understanding the Family Structure:**\n   - Linda has 3 brothers.\n   - Linda has 6 sisters.\n   - Linda herself is also a sister.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Relationships:**\n   - Each of Linda's brothers will have the same number of sisters as Linda does, because they are all siblings in the same family.\n   - Therefore, the number of sisters each brother has is the total number of sisters in the family.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Sisters:**\n   - Linda is one of the sisters, so the total number of sisters is Linda plus her 6 sisters.\n   - Total sisters = 6 (Linda's sisters) + 1 (Linda herself) = 7 sisters.\n\nThus, each of Linda's brothers has 7 sisters.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Linda has\nlinda_sisters = 6\n\n# Including Linda herself\ntotal_sisters = linda_sisters + 1\n\n# Output the total number of sisters each brother has\nprint(total_sisters)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of sisters each brother has.",
    "The code execution confirms that each of Linda's brothers has 7 sisters. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 3 brothers and she also has 6 sisters.
