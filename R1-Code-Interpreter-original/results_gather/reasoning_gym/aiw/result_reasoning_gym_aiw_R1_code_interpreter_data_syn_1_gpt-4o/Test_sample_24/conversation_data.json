  "question": "Sarah has 4 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Sarah and James, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 4 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 4 males + 6 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in James's circle = 5 males + 3 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and James.\n   - This means Matilda is counted in both Sarah's and James's circles.\n\n4. **Understanding the Circles:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Sarah and James, she is the only overlap between the two circles.\n   - Therefore, the total number of unique individuals in the combined circles is the sum of the two circles minus one (for Matilda being counted twice).\n\n5. **Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is part of both circles, so her female colleagues are the union of the female colleagues from both circles.\n   - Sarah's circle has 6 female colleagues.\n   - James's circle has 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues from both circles.\n\nLet's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Sarah's circle\nsarah_female_colleagues = 6\n\n# Number of female colleagues in James's circle\njames_female_colleagues = 3\n\n# Total unique female colleagues Matilda has\ntotal_female_colleagues = sarah_female_colleagues + james_female_colleagues\n\nprint(total_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution shows that Matilda has a total of 9 female colleagues. This is because she is part of both Sarah's and James's circles, and the female colleagues from both circles are unique to her.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
