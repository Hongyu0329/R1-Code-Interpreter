  "question": "Linda has 4 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Michael has 1 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Michael and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Linda and Michael, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues.\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - Michael has 1 male colleague and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Michael's circle = 1 male + 6 females = 7 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and Michael.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both Linda's and Michael's circles.\n\n4. **Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has.\n   - In Linda's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n   - In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n   - Matilda is counted in both circles, so we need to consider the overlap.\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles, the female colleagues in Michael's circle (6 females) include Matilda herself. Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has, excluding herself, is 6 - 1 = 5.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Michael's circle\nfemale_colleagues_michael = 6\n\n# Matilda is included in the count of female colleagues in Michael's circle\n# So, the number of female colleagues Matilda has, excluding herself\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_michael - 1\n\nprint(female_colleagues_matilda)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution confirms that Matilda has 5 female colleagues. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
