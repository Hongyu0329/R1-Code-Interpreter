    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described. \n\n1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means Alice is one of the siblings, and she has 2 sisters. Therefore, the total number of sisters in Alice's family is 3 (including Alice herself).\n\n2. The question asks about Joseph's brother. However, the problem does not provide any information about Joseph or his family. Therefore, we cannot determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has based on the information given.\n\nThe problem seems to be a trick question or a riddle, as it does not provide enough information to directly answer the question about Joseph's brother. \n\nGiven the information, the answer is that we cannot determine the number of sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\n<<<0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice has 2 sisters and she also has 1 brothers.
