    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships between Mary, her friends, and William.\n\n1. Mary has 2 male friends and 2 female friends.\n2. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n3. William is one of the male friends of Mary.\n\nLet's list the friends:\n- Male friends: William and another male friend (let's call him John).\n- Female friends: Two female friends (let's call them Alice and Emma).\n\nSince all of them are friends with each other, William is friends with:\n- Mary\n- John (the other male friend)\n- Alice (one of the female friends)\n- Emma (the other female friend)\n\nNow, we need to determine how many female friends William has. From the list above, William is friends with Alice and Emma, who are both female.\n\nTherefore, William has 2 female friends.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Mary has 2 male friends and she also has 2 female friends.
