    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Margaret's brother has. \n\n1. Margaret has 5 sisters.\n2. Margaret's brother is also a sibling of Margaret.\n3. Therefore, Margaret's brother shares the same sisters as Margaret.\n\nThus, Margaret's brother has the same number of sisters as Margaret does.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- Margaret has 5 sisters.\n- Therefore, Margaret's brother also has 5 sisters.\n\nThe final answer is straightforward and doesn't require any complex calculations or code execution.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Margaret has 2 brothers and she also has 5 sisters.
