    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described.\n\n1. Susan has 2 sisters and 2 brothers. This means there are 5 siblings in total: Susan, her 2 sisters, and her 2 brothers.\n\n2. James is one of Susan's brothers. Therefore, James is part of the same sibling group.\n\n3. We need to determine how many sisters James's brother has. Since James is one of the brothers, the question is essentially asking how many sisters James has.\n\nFrom the information given, Susan has 2 sisters. Therefore, James, being part of the same sibling group, also has 2 sisters.\n\nThus, the number of sisters James's brother has is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Susan has 2 sisters and she also has 2 brothers.
