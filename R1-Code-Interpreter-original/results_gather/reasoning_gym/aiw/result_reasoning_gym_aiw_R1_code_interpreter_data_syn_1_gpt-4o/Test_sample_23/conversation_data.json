    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Linda's brother has. \n\n1. **Understanding the Family Structure:**\n   - Linda has 6 brothers.\n   - Linda has 3 sisters.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Relationships:**\n   - Since Linda is one of the sisters, the total number of sisters in the family is 3.\n   - Each of Linda's brothers will have the same number of sisters as Linda does, because they are all siblings in the same family.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, each of Linda's brothers will have 3 sisters.\n\nThe final answer is straightforward and does not require any complex calculations or code execution. \n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 6 brothers and she also has 3 sisters.
