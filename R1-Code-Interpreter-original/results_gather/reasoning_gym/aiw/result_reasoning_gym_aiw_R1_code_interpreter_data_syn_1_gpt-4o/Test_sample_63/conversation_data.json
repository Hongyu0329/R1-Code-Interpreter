  "question": "Sarah has 2 male colleagues and she also has 4 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 1 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and connections between Sarah's and Thomas's circles of colleagues.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n   - Including Sarah, the total number of people in Sarah's circle = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 1 male colleague and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 1 male + 2 females = 3 colleagues.\n   - Including Thomas, the total number of people in Thomas's circle = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n3. **Common Colleague - Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and Thomas.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Sarah's circle, she has 2 male and 4 female colleagues from Sarah's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Thomas's circle, she has 1 male and 2 female colleagues from Thomas's circle.\n   - However, we need to consider that Matilda is counted in both circles, and we need to find the unique set of colleagues.\n\n5. **Finding Unique Colleagues for Matilda:**\n   - Matilda's unique colleagues are the union of Sarah's and Thomas's circles, excluding Matilda herself.\n   - We need to find the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Sarah's circle\nsarah_male_colleagues = 2\nsarah_female_colleagues = 4\n\n# Thomas's circle\nthomas_male_colleagues = 1\nthomas_female_colleagues = 2\n\n# Matilda is common in both circles\n# Total unique female colleagues for Matilda\nunique_female_colleagues = sarah_female_colleagues + thomas_female_colleagues - 1  # Subtract 1 for Matilda herself\n\nprint(unique_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Matilda has 5 female colleagues. This result is derived from the following reasoning:\n\n- Matilda is part of both Sarah's and Thomas's circles.\n- In Sarah's circle, there are 4 female colleagues.\n- In Thomas's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n- Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting Matilda herself.\n\nThus, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
