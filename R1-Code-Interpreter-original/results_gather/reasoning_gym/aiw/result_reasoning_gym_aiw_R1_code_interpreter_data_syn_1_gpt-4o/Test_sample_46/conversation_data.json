All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. William has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around William are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around William do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of William and she is also colleague of Patricia, being part of Patricia's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Patricia and William, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Patricia's Circle:**\n   - Patricia has 6 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Patricia's circle = 6 males + 6 females = 12 colleagues.\n\n2. **William's Circle:**\n   - William has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in William's circle = 3 males + 6 females = 9 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and William.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Understanding the Overlap:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Patricia and William, she is the only overlap between the two circles.\n   - This means that the rest of the people in William's circle are not in Patricia's circle, except for Matilda.\n\n5. **Calculating Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In William's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of William's circle, she is one of these 6 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues in William's circle.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation:\n\n- Total females in William's circle = 6\n- Matilda is one of these females.\n- Therefore, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues in William's circle.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Patricia has 6 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues.
