    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Jessica and William. The problem states that Jessica has 3 sisters and 1 brother. However, it does not provide any direct information about William's family or his relationship to Jessica.\n\nThe key point here is to determine if William is related to Jessica in any way. If William is Jessica's brother, then he would have the same number of sisters as Jessica. If William is not related to Jessica, we cannot determine the number of sisters William's brother has based on the information given.\n\nSince the problem does not specify any relationship between William and Jessica, we cannot assume that William is Jessica's brother. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of sisters William's brother has based on the information provided.\n\nThus, the answer is that we do not have enough information to determine how many sisters William's brother has.\n\n<<<We do not have enough information to determine how many sisters William's brother has.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jessica has 3 sisters and she also has 1 brothers.
