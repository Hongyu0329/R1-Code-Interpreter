  "question": "Susan has 2 male colleagues and she also has 4 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Susan has. All these mentioned persons around Susan are colleagues of each other. Charles has 4 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Susan, being part of Susan's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Susan's circle:\n   - 2 male colleagues\n   - 4 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 colleagues (including Susan)\n\n2. Charles's circle:\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 10 colleagues (including Charles)\n\n3. Matilda is a colleague of both Susan and Charles, meaning she is part of both circles.\n\nWe need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap and the unique members in each circle.\n\nLet's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and unique members in each circle.\n\n- Matilda is part of Susan's circle, which has 4 female colleagues.\n- Matilda is also part of Charles's circle, which has 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Susan and Charles, we need to account for her being counted in both circles. Therefore, we need to find the unique female colleagues in both circles.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Susan's circle\nfemale_susan = 4\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Charles's circle\nfemale_charles = 6\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double counting\nunique_female_colleagues = female_susan + female_charles - 1\n\nprint(unique_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and unique members in each circle.",
    "The code output indicates that Matilda has 9 female colleagues. This result is derived from the following reasoning:\n\n- Susan's circle has 4 female colleagues.\n- Charles's circle has 6 female colleagues.\n- Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double counting her.\n\nThus, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is \\(4 + 6 - 1 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
