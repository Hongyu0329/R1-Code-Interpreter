    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described.\n\n1. Linda has 3 sisters and 1 brother. This means Linda is one of the sisters, so there are 4 sisters in total (including Linda herself).\n\n2. The question asks about Thomas's brother. Since Linda has 1 brother, and assuming Thomas is that brother, we need to determine how many sisters Thomas has.\n\n3. Since Thomas is Linda's brother, he shares the same siblings as Linda. Therefore, Thomas has the same number of sisters as Linda does.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of sisters Thomas has:\n\n- Linda has 3 sisters, and she is one of them, making it 4 sisters in total.\n\nThus, Thomas, being Linda's brother, also has 4 sisters.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 3 sisters and she also has 1 brothers.
