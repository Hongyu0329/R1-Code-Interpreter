  "question": "Jessica has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jessica has. All these mentioned persons around Jessica are colleagues of each other. James has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Jessica, being part of Jessica's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Jessica and James, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Jessica's Circle:**\n   - Jessica has 5 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Jessica's circle = 5 males + 5 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in James's circle = 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Jessica and James.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Jessica's circle, she has access to all of Jessica's colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of James's circle, she has access to all of James's colleagues.\n\n5. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - From Jessica's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n   - From James's circle, Matilda has 1 female colleague.\n   - However, since Matilda is the connecting link, the female colleague in James's circle is already counted in Jessica's circle (as Matilda is the only link between the two circles).\n\nThus, Matilda has 5 female colleagues from Jessica's circle, and the female colleague from James's circle is already included in this count.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jessica has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues.
