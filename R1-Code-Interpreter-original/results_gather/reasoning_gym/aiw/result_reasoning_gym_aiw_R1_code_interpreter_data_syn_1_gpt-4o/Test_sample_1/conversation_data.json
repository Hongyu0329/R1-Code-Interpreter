    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Alice's friends. Alice has 3 male friends and 4 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break down the group:\n- Total male friends: 3 (including Michael)\n- Total female friends: 4\n\nSince all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, each male friend, including Michael, is friends with all the female friends. Therefore, Michael, being one of the male friends, will have all 4 female friends as his friends.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python code to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends\nmale_friends = 3\nfemale_friends = 4\n\n# Since all friends are friends with each other, each male friend has all female friends\nmichael_female_friends = female_friends\n\nprint(michael_female_friends)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of female friends Michael has.",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning. Since all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, Michael, being one of the male friends, has all 4 female friends as his friends.\n\n<<<4>>>"
