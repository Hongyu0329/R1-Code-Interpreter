    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda, her friends, and Charles. \n\n1. Linda has 2 male friends and 2 female friends.\n2. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n3. Charles is one of the male friends of Linda.\n\nSince all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, Charles, being one of the male friends, is also friends with the 2 female friends of Linda. Therefore, Charles has 2 female friends.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple logical check:\n\n- Linda's friends: 2 males (including Charles) and 2 females.\n- Charles, being one of the male friends, is friends with the other male and the 2 females.\n\nThus, Charles has 2 female friends.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 2 male friends and she also has 2 female friends.
