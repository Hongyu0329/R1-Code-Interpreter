    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Alice's friends. Alice has 4 male friends and 5 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means that each male friend of Alice is also friends with all of Alice's female friends.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Alice has 4 male friends: Let's call them Charles, Bob, David, and Edward.\n2. Alice has 5 female friends: Let's call them Fiona, Grace, Helen, Irene, and Jane.\n\nSince all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, Charles, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 5 of Alice's female friends.\n\nTherefore, Charles has 5 female friends.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice has 4 male friends and she also has 5 female friends.
