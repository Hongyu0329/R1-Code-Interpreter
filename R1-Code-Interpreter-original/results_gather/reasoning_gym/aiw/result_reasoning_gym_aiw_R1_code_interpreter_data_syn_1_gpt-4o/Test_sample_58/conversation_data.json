    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Patricia and Joseph. The problem states that Patricia has 5 sisters and 6 brothers. It does not explicitly mention Joseph, but we can infer that Joseph is one of Patricia's brothers.\n\nSince Patricia has 5 sisters, and Joseph is one of Patricia's brothers, Joseph would have the same number of sisters as Patricia. This is because they are siblings, and the number of sisters would be the same for all brothers and sisters in the family.\n\nTherefore, Joseph's brother (which could be Joseph himself or any of his other brothers) would also have the same number of sisters as Patricia.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- Patricia has 5 sisters.\n- Therefore, Joseph's brother also has 5 sisters.\n\nThus, the number of sisters Joseph's brother has is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Patricia has 5 sisters and she also has 6 brothers.
