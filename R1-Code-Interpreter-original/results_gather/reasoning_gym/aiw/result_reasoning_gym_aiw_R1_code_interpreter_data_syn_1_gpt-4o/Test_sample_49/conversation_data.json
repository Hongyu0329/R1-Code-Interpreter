    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Jessica's friends. Jessica has 5 male friends and 5 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means that each male friend is friends with all the female friends and vice versa.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Jessica has 5 male friends: Let's call them M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5.\n2. Jessica has 5 female friends: Let's call them F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5.\n3. Each male friend is friends with all the female friends because they are all friends with each other.\n\nNow, let's focus on David, who is one of the male friends (say M1). Since all the male and female friends are friends with each other, David (M1) is friends with all 5 female friends: F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5.\n\nTherefore, David has 5 female friends.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jessica has 5 male friends and she also has 5 female friends.
