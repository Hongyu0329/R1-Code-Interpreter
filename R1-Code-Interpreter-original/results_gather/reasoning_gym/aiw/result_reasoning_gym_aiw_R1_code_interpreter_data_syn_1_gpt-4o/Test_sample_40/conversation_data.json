    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Margaret and Robert. The problem states that Margaret has 6 sisters and 3 brothers. \n\n1. **Understanding the Family Structure:**\n   - Margaret has 6 sisters. This means there are 7 girls in total (including Margaret herself).\n   - Margaret has 3 brothers.\n\n2. **Identifying Robert's Relationship:**\n   - If Robert is one of Margaret's brothers, then he shares the same siblings as Margaret.\n   - Therefore, Robert would have the same number of sisters as Margaret.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Margaret has 6 sisters, Robert, being one of the brothers, would also have 6 sisters.\n\nThus, Robert's brother (which could be Robert himself or one of the other brothers) would have 6 sisters.\n\n<<<6>>>"
