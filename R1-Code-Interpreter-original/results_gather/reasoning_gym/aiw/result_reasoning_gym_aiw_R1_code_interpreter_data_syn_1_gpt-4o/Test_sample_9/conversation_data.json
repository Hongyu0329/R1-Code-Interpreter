    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Linda has 4 male friends and 5 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Linda has 4 male friends: Let's call them M1, M2, M3, and M4.\n2. Linda has 5 female friends: Let's call them F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5.\n3. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n\nThe question asks how many female friends Robert, one of the male friends, has. Since Robert is one of the 4 male friends, he is friends with all 5 female friends because they are all friends with each other.\n\nTherefore, Robert has 5 female friends.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 4 male friends and she also has 5 female friends.
