  "question": "Sarah has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. John has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Sarah and John, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 5 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 5 males + 5 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - John has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and John.\n   - Matilda is part of both Sarah's and John's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Sarah's circle, she has access to all of Sarah's colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of John's circle, she also has access to all of John's colleagues.\n   - However, we need to consider the overlap and unique colleagues.\n\n5. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - From Sarah's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n   - From John's circle, Matilda has 4 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\nLet's calculate the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap:\n\n- Matilda is counted once in both circles.\n- The unique female colleagues Matilda has are the union of female colleagues from both circles.\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Sarah's female colleagues\nsarah_female_colleagues = 5\n\n# John's female colleagues\njohn_female_colleagues = 4\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting\nunique_female_colleagues = sarah_female_colleagues + john_female_colleagues - 1\n\nprint(unique_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Matilda has 8 unique female colleagues. This result is derived from the union of female colleagues in both Sarah's and John's circles, accounting for the overlap through Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
