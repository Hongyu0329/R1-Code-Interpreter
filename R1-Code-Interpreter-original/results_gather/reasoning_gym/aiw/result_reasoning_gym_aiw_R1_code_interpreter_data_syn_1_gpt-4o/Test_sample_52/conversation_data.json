Joseph has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. \n\nFirst, let's summarize the information given:\n\n1. Mary has 1 male colleague and 5 female colleagues. Therefore, Mary's circle consists of 1 male + 5 females = 6 people, including Mary herself.\n\n2. Joseph has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. Therefore, Joseph's circle consists of 6 males + 3 females = 9 people, including Joseph himself.\n\n3. Matilda is a part of both Mary's and Joseph's circles. \n\n4. The people in Joseph's circle do not have other colleagues aside from those in the circle, except for Matilda, who is also in Mary's circle.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Mary's circle, there are 5 female colleagues (including Matilda).\n- In Joseph's circle, there are 3 female colleagues (including Matilda).\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to find the unique female colleagues Matilda has. \n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Mary's circle (including Matilda)\nfemales_mary_circle = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Joseph's circle (including Matilda)\nfemales_joseph_circle = 3\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her\nunique_female_colleagues = females_mary_circle + females_joseph_circle - 1\n\nprint(unique_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution output indicates that Matilda has 7 unique female colleagues. This result is derived from the following reasoning:\n\n- Matilda is part of both Mary's and Joseph's circles.\n- In Mary's circle, there are 5 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n- In Joseph's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n- Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her.\n\nThus, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is 5 (from Mary's circle) + 3 (from Joseph's circle) - 1 (Matilda herself) = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
