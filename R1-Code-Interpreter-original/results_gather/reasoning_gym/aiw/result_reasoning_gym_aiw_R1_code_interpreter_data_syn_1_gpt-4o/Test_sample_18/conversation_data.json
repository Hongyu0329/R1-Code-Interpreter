    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the social network described. Elizabeth has 6 male friends and 2 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break down the group:\n\n- Total number of friends Elizabeth has: 6 male + 2 female = 8 friends.\n- Since all of them are friends with each other, each male friend is also friends with the 2 female friends.\n\nNow, let's focus on David, who is one of the 6 male friends. Since all friends are interconnected:\n\n- David is friends with the 2 female friends of Elizabeth.\n\nTherefore, David has 2 female friends.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward because the problem states that all friends are interconnected and have no other friends outside this group. Thus, each male friend, including David, is friends with the 2 female friends.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Elizabeth has 6 male friends and she also has 2 female friends.
