    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Jennifer and Bob. The problem states that Jennifer has 2 sisters and 6 brothers. This means Jennifer is part of a family with 3 daughters (including herself) and 6 sons.\n\nThe question asks about Bob's brother. Since Bob is one of Jennifer's brothers, we need to determine how many sisters Bob's brother has. \n\nSince Bob is one of the 6 brothers, any of Bob's brothers would have the same number of sisters as Bob does. Therefore, we need to find out how many sisters Bob has.\n\nJennifer has 2 sisters, which means Bob, being one of Jennifer's brothers, also has 2 sisters. \n\nThus, Bob's brother has 2 sisters.\n\n<<<2>>>"
