    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and constraints given in the problem statement.\n\n1. Alice has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of Alice's friends are friends with each other.\n3. Alice's friends have no other friends aside from each other.\n\nLet's denote:\n- Alice's male friends as M1 and M2.\n- Alice's female friend as F1.\n\nSince all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, M1, M2, and F1 are all friends with each other. \n\nNow, let's focus on Richard, who is one of Alice's male friends (let's assume Richard is M1). According to the problem:\n- Richard is friends with M2 and F1.\n- Since they have no other friends aside from each other, Richard's only female friend is F1.\n\nThus, Richard has exactly 1 female friend.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer:\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice has 2 male friends and she also has 1 female friends.
