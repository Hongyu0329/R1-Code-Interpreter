    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Patricia and Bob. The problem states that Patricia has 6 sisters and 4 brothers. It does not explicitly mention Bob, but we can infer that Bob is one of Patricia's brothers. \n\nIf Bob is one of Patricia's brothers, then he shares the same siblings as Patricia. Therefore, Bob's brother (which could be Bob himself or one of his other brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Patricia does.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- Patricia has 6 sisters.\n- Patricia has 4 brothers, one of whom is Bob.\n- Therefore, Bob's brother (including Bob himself) would have the same number of sisters as Patricia.\n\nThus, Bob's brother has 6 sisters.\n\n<<<6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Patricia has 6 sisters and she also has 4 brothers.
