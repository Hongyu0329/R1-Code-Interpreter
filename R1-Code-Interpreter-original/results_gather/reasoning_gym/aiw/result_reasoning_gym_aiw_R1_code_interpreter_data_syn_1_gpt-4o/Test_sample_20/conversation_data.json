  "question": "Mary has 4 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Mary has. All these mentioned persons around Mary are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Mary and Thomas and determine how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - Mary has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Mary's circle = 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues.\n   - Including Mary, the total number of people in Mary's circle = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues.\n   - Including Thomas, the total number of people in Thomas's circle = 5 + 1 = 6.\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Mary and Thomas.\n   - She is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Mary's circle, there are 3 female colleagues (including Matilda).\n   - In Thomas's circle, there is 1 female colleague (including Matilda).\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues she has. Matilda herself is counted in both circles, so we need to exclude her from the count of female colleagues.\n\nLet's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and excluding Matilda herself.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Mary's circle (including Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_mary = 3\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Thomas's circle (including Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_thomas = 1\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to exclude her\nunique_female_colleagues = (female_colleagues_mary - 1) + (female_colleagues_thomas - 1)\n\n# Since Matilda is counted twice, we add 1 back to account for her being a unique connection\nunique_female_colleagues += 1\n\nprint(unique_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution indicates that Matilda has 3 female colleagues. Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n- In Mary's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n- In Thomas's circle, there is 1 female colleague, including Matilda.\n- Matilda is counted in both circles, so we initially subtract her once from each circle's count.\n- After adjusting for the overlap, we find that Matilda has 3 unique female colleagues.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
