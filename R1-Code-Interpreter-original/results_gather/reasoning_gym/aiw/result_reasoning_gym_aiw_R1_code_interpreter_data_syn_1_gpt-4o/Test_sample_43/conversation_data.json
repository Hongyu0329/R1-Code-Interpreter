    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Susan, her friends, and Joseph. \n\n1. Susan has 1 male friend and 6 female friends. \n2. All of Susan's friends are friends with each other.\n3. Joseph is the male friend of Susan.\n\nSince all of Susan's friends are friends with each other, Joseph, being the only male friend, is friends with all of Susan's female friends. Therefore, Joseph has 6 female friends.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation:\n\n- Total number of Susan's friends = 1 male + 6 female = 7 friends.\n- Joseph, being the only male friend, is friends with the 6 female friends.\n\nThus, Joseph has 6 female friends.\n\n<<<6>>>"
