    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and friendships described.\n\n1. Linda has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of these friends are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n- Linda's friends: 2 males (let's call them Bob and Tom) and 1 female (let's call her Alice).\n- Since they are all friends with each other, Bob is friends with Tom and Alice.\n- The problem states that they have no other friends aside from this group.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many female friends Bob has:\n\n- Bob is friends with Linda (female) and Alice (female).\n- Therefore, Bob has 2 female friends.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple code to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the friends\nlinda_friends = {\n    \"Bob\": {\"Linda\", \"Tom\", \"Alice\"},\n    \"Tom\": {\"Linda\", \"Bob\", \"Alice\"},\n    \"Alice\": {\"Linda\", \"Bob\", \"Tom\"}\n}\n\n# Count the number of female friends Bob has\nbob_friends = linda_friends[\"Bob\"]\nfemale_friends_of_bob = {\"Linda\", \"Alice\"}  # Both are female\n\n# Calculate the intersection to find how many female friends Bob has\nfemale_friends_count = len(bob_friends.intersection(female_friends_of_bob))\n\nprint(female_friends_count)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the number of female friends Bob has.",
    "The code execution confirms that Bob has 2 female friends. Based on the problem's description and the relationships among the friends, Bob is friends with both Linda and Alice, who are female.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 2 male friends and she also has 1 female friends.
