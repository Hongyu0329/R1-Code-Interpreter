  "question": "Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Jennifer and Thomas, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Jennifer's circle = 6 males + 5 females = 11 colleagues.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and Thomas.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Understanding the Overlap:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jennifer and Thomas, she is the only overlap between the two circles.\n   - Therefore, the circles are otherwise disjoint except for Matilda.\n\n5. **Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jennifer's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - In Thomas's circle, there is 1 female colleague.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, the female colleague in Thomas's circle is Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda's female colleagues are the 5 females from Jennifer's circle.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle\nfemale_colleagues_jennifer = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Thomas's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_thomas = 1\n\n# Since Matilda is the only overlap, the female colleague in Thomas's circle is Matilda herself.\n# Therefore, Matilda's female colleagues are the 5 females from Jennifer's circle.\nmatilda_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_jennifer\n\nprint(matilda_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "Based on the reasoning and the code execution, we have determined that Matilda has 5 female colleagues. This is because she shares the female colleagues from Jennifer's circle, and the only female colleague in Thomas's circle is Matilda herself.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues.
