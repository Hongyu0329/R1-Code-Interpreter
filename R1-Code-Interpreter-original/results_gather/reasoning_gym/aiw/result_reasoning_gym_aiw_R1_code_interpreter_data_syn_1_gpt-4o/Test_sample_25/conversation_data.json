    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described in the question. \n\n1. Margaret has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means there are 4 siblings in total: Margaret, her 2 sisters, and her 1 brother.\n\n2. The question asks about Charles's brother. Since Margaret's brother is Charles, we need to determine how many sisters Charles has.\n\n3. Since Charles is Margaret's brother, he shares the same siblings as Margaret. Therefore, Charles has the same number of sisters as Margaret.\n\n4. Margaret has 2 sisters, so Charles also has 2 sisters.\n\nThus, the number of sisters Charles's brother has is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Margaret has 2 sisters and she also has 1 brothers.
