  "question": "Jennifer has 1 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. William has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around William are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around William do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of William and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and connections between Jennifer's and William's circles of colleagues, considering the shared colleague, Matilda.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 7 colleagues (including Jennifer)\n\n2. **William's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 colleagues (including William)\n\n3. **Shared Colleague:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and William.\n\nGiven that Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap and the unique members in each circle.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Jennifer's Circle (excluding Matilda):**\n  - 1 male colleague\n  - 5 female colleagues (since Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues)\n\n- **William's Circle (excluding Matilda):**\n  - 2 male colleagues (since Matilda is not male)\n  - 2 female colleagues (since Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues)\n\nNow, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, her female colleagues are the unique female members from both circles.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Jennifer's circle\njennifer_male_colleagues = 1\njennifer_female_colleagues = 6\n\n# William's circle\nwilliam_male_colleagues = 3\nwilliam_female_colleagues = 3\n\n# Matilda is part of both circles\n# Excluding Matilda from Jennifer's circle\njennifer_female_colleagues_excluding_matilda = jennifer_female_colleagues - 1\n\n# Excluding Matilda from William's circle\nwilliam_female_colleagues_excluding_matilda = william_female_colleagues - 1\n\n# Total unique female colleagues for Matilda\nmatilda_female_colleagues = jennifer_female_colleagues_excluding_matilda + william_female_colleagues_excluding_matilda\n\nprint(matilda_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution indicates that Matilda has 7 female colleagues. This result is derived from the sum of the unique female colleagues in both Jennifer's and William's circles, excluding Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
