  "question": "Mary has 3 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Mary has. All these mentioned persons around Mary are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 1 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships and connections between the colleagues of Mary and Thomas, and how Matilda fits into both circles.\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - Mary has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Mary's circle = 3 males + 6 females = 9 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Mary's circle.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 1 male colleague and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 1 male + 1 female = 2 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the female colleague in Thomas's circle.\n\n3. **Matilda's Connections:**\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n   - In Mary's circle, she is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n   - In Thomas's circle, she is the only female colleague.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider her connections in both circles.\n\n- In Mary's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues. Therefore, she has 5 other female colleagues in Mary's circle.\n- In Thomas's circle, Matilda is the only female colleague, so she has no additional female colleagues there.\n\nThus, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is the number of female colleagues in Mary's circle, excluding herself.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Mary's circle\nfemale_colleagues_mary = 6\n\n# Matilda is one of the female colleagues, so we exclude her\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_mary - 1\n\nprint(female_colleagues_matilda)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the number of female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the correct output. Based on the reasoning and the code execution, we can conclude that Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n\n<<<5>>>"
