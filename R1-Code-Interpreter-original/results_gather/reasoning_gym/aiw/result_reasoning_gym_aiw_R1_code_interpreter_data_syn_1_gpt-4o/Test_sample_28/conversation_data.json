    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described. \n\n1. Margaret has 2 sisters and 3 brothers. This means Margaret is one of the siblings, and she has 2 sisters, making a total of 3 girls in the family (including herself).\n\n2. Margaret also has 3 brothers. Therefore, the total number of siblings in the family is 3 girls + 3 boys = 6 siblings.\n\n3. The question asks how many sisters Robert's brother has. Since Robert is one of Margaret's brothers, Robert's brother would also be one of Margaret's brothers.\n\n4. All of Margaret's brothers, including Robert's brother, have the same number of sisters, which is 3 (Margaret and her 2 sisters).\n\nThus, Robert's brother has 3 sisters.\n\n<<<3>>>"
