    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships between Margaret and her friends. \n\n1. Margaret has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of them are friends with each other and have no other friends aside.\n\nLet's denote:\n- M1 and M2 as the two male friends of Margaret.\n- F1 as the female friend of Margaret.\n\nSince they are all friends with each other:\n- M1 is friends with M2 and F1.\n- M2 is friends with M1 and F1.\n- F1 is friends with M1 and M2.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many female friends James (one of the male friends, say M1) has. \n\nSince F1 is the only female friend in this group and all of them are friends with each other, James (M1) has exactly one female friend, which is F1.\n\nThus, the number of female friends James has is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Margaret has 2 male friends and she also has 1 female friends.
