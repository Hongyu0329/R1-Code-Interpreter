    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Patricia's brother has. \n\n1. We know that Patricia has 6 brothers and 2 sisters.\n2. Patricia herself is also a sister to her brothers.\n3. Therefore, each of Patricia's brothers has 3 sisters in total: Patricia and her 2 other sisters.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Patricia has\npatricia_sisters = 2\n\n# Including Patricia herself\ntotal_sisters_for_brother = patricia_sisters + 1\n\nprint(total_sisters_for_brother)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that each of Patricia's brothers has 3 sisters. This includes Patricia herself and her 2 other sisters.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Patricia has 6 brothers and she also has 2 sisters.
