  "question": "Jennifer has 5 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. Joseph has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Jennifer and Joseph, considering the overlap due to Matilda.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - 5 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 8 colleagues (including Jennifer)\n\n2. **Joseph's Circle:**\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 4 female colleagues\n   - Total: 8 colleagues (including Joseph)\n\n3. **Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jennifer and Joseph.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Determine how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- Matilda is part of both circles. \n- In Jennifer's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n- In Joseph's circle, there are 4 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues she has.\n\nLet's calculate the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and the total number of females in both circles.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle (including Matilda)\nfemales_jennifer_circle = 3\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Joseph's circle (including Matilda)\nfemales_joseph_circle = 4\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her\nunique_female_colleagues = females_jennifer_circle + females_joseph_circle - 1\n\nprint(unique_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has.",
    "The code execution indicates that Matilda has 6 unique female colleagues. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- In Jennifer's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n- In Joseph's circle, there are 4 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n- Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her.\n\nThus, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
