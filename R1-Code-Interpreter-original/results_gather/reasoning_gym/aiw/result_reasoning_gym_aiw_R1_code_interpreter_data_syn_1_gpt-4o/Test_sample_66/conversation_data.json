    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the given conditions:\n\n1. Mary has 4 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of these friends are friends with each other.\n3. They have no other friends aside from this group.\n\nLet's break down the group:\n- Mary (1 female)\n- 4 male friends (including David)\n- 1 female friend\n\nSince all of them are friends with each other, David, being one of the male friends, will have the same set of friends as Mary. This means David is friends with:\n- Mary (1 female)\n- The other 3 male friends\n- The 1 female friend of Mary\n\nNow, we need to determine how many female friends David has:\n- Mary is a female friend.\n- The 1 female friend of Mary is also a female friend of David.\n\nThus, David has 2 female friends in total.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the group of friends\nmary_friends = {\n    \"males\": 4,  # Including David\n    \"females\": 1  # Mary's female friend\n}\n\n# David's female friends include Mary and Mary's female friend\ndavid_female_friends = 1 + mary_friends[\"females\"]\n\n# Output the number of female friends David has\nprint(david_female_friends)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the number of female friends David has.",
    "The code execution confirms that David has 2 female friends. This matches our logical reasoning based on the problem's conditions.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Mary has 4 male friends and she also has 1 female friends.
