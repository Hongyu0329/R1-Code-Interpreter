  "question": "Linda has 3 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has, given the information about Linda's and Charles's circles of colleagues.\n\n1. **Understanding Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 3 males + 5 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n2. **Understanding Charles's Circle:**\n   - Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Charles's circle = 6 males + 2 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and Charles.\n   - Therefore, she is counted in both circles.\n\n4. **Finding Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n   - Matilda is one of the 2 female colleagues in Charles's circle.\n   - The other female colleague in Charles's circle is not part of Linda's circle (since Matilda is the only overlap).\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 1 female colleague in Charles's circle (excluding herself).\n\n5. **Counting Female Colleagues in Linda's Circle:**\n   - In Linda's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Linda's circle, she is one of these 5.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues in Linda's circle.\n\n6. **Total Female Colleagues for Matilda:**\n   - Matilda has 1 female colleague from Charles's circle (excluding herself).\n   - Matilda has 4 female colleagues from Linda's circle (excluding herself).\n   - Total female colleagues = 1 (from Charles's circle) + 4 (from Linda's circle) = 5 female colleagues.\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation with a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle\nfemale_colleagues_linda = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Charles's circle\nfemale_colleagues_charles = 2\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we need to find the unique count\n# Matilda is one of the female colleagues in both circles\n# Therefore, we subtract 1 from each to find the unique count\nunique_female_colleagues_linda = female_colleagues_linda - 1\nunique_female_colleagues_charles = female_colleagues_charles - 1\n\n# Total unique female colleagues for Matilda\ntotal_female_colleagues = unique_female_colleagues_linda + unique_female_colleagues_charles\n\nprint(total_female_colleagues)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that Matilda has 5 female colleagues. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 3 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues.
