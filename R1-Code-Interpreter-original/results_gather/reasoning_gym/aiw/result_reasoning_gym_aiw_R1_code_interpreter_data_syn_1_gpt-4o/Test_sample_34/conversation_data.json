    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described:\n\n1. Susan has 3 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. We need to determine how many sisters Michael's brother has.\n\nAssuming that Michael is one of Susan's brothers, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Susan has 3 sisters, Michael, being Susan's brother, would also have the same number of sisters. This is because siblings share the same set of sisters and brothers.\n\nTherefore, Michael's brother (who is also one of Susan's brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Susan does.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of sisters Michael's brother has:\n\n- Susan has 3 sisters.\n- Therefore, Michael's brother also has 3 sisters.\n\nThus, the answer is straightforward.\n\n<<<3>>>"
