    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships and the information given:\n\n1. Jennifer has 2 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. We need to determine how many sisters Michael's brother has.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Jennifer has 2 sisters, it means there are 3 sisters in total (including Jennifer herself).\n- Jennifer has 4 brothers.\n- Michael is one of Jennifer's brothers.\n\nSince Michael is one of Jennifer's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Jennifer. Therefore, Michael's brother (who is also one of Jennifer's brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Jennifer does.\n\nThus, Michael's brother has 3 sisters.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jennifer has 2 sisters and she also has 4 brothers.
