    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Elizabeth's friends. Elizabeth has 2 male friends and 4 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Elizabeth's group of friends consists of 2 males and 4 females.\n2. Thomas is one of the male friends.\n3. Since all friends are friends with each other, Thomas is friends with all the females in the group.\n\nTherefore, Thomas, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 4 female friends of Elizabeth.\n\nNow, let's confirm this understanding with a simple calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of male and female friends\nmale_friends = 2\nfemale_friends = 4\n\n# Thomas is one of the male friends\n# Since all friends are friends with each other, Thomas is friends with all female friends\nthomas_female_friends = female_friends\n\nprint(thomas_female_friends)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of female friends Thomas has.",
    "The code execution confirms that Thomas, a male friend of Elizabeth, has 4 female friends. This is because all of Elizabeth's friends are friends with each other, and there are 4 female friends in total.\n\n<<<4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Elizabeth has 2 male friends and she also has 4 female friends.
