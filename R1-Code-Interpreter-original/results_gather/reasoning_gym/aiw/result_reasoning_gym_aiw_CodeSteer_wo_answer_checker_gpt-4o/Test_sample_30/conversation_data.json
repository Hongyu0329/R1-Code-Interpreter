  "question": "Jennifer has 2 male colleagues and she also has 4 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. John has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Jennifer has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues. This means Jennifer's circle has 2 males + 4 females + Jennifer = 7 people.\n\n2. John has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues. This means John's circle has 3 males + 6 females + John = 10 people.\n\n3. Matilda is a special case because she is a colleague of both John and Jennifer. Therefore, she is counted in both circles.\n\n4. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of John's circle, we will consider the female colleagues in John's circle.\n\n5. In John's circle, there are 6 female colleagues. Since Matilda is part of this circle, she has 6 female colleagues.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in John's circle\nfemale_colleagues_john = 6\n\n# Output the answer\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_john}>>>\")\n```"
