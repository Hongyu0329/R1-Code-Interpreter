    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Margaret's friends. Margaret has 5 male friends and 5 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means each male friend is friends with all 5 female friends.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Margaret has 5 male friends: M1, M2, M3, M4, M5.\n2. Margaret has 5 female friends: F1, F2, F3, F4, F5.\n3. Each male friend, including Thomas, is friends with all 5 female friends.\n\nTherefore, Thomas, being one of the male friends, has 5 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Thomas has\nfemale_friends_of_thomas = 5\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_thomas}>>>\")\n```"
