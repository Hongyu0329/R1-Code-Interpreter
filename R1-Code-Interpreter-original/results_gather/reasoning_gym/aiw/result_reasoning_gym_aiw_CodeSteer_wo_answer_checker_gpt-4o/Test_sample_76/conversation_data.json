    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Patricia and Bob. The problem states that Patricia has 6 sisters and 4 brothers. This means Patricia is one of the siblings, so the total number of sisters including Patricia is 7 (6 sisters + Patricia herself).\n\nSince Bob is one of Patricia's brothers, he shares the same siblings. Therefore, Bob's brother (which could be Bob himself or one of his other brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Patricia.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sisters Patricia has, including herself.\n2. Since Bob is one of Patricia's brothers, he shares the same number of sisters.\n3. Output the number of sisters Bob's brother has in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Patricia has 6 sisters, so including herself, there are 7 sisters in total.\ntotal_sisters = 6 + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
