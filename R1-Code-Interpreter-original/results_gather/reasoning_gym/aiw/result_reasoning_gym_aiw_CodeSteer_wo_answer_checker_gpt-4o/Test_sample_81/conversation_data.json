    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described:\n\n1. Elizabeth has 5 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. James is one of Elizabeth's brothers.\n\nSince James is one of Elizabeth's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Elizabeth. Therefore, James's brother (which could be James himself or one of his other brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Elizabeth does.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the number of sisters James's brother has.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Elizabeth has\nsisters_of_elizabeth = 5\n\n# Since James is one of Elizabeth's brothers, he has the same number of sisters\nsisters_of_james_brother = sisters_of_elizabeth\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_james_brother}>>>\")\n```"
