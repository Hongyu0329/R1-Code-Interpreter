    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships described:\n\n1. Alice has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of Alice's friends are friends with each other.\n3. Richard is one of Alice's male friends.\n\nSince all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, Richard, being one of the male friends, is also friends with Alice's female friend. Therefore, Richard has 1 female friend.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Richard has 1 female friend, who is Alice's female friend.\nfemale_friends_of_richard = 1\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_richard}>>>\")\n```"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Alice has 2 male friends and she also has 1 female friends.
