  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Jennifer's brother has. Since Jennifer has 6 sisters, each of her brothers will also have the same number of sisters. This is because all siblings share the same set of sisters.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Identify the number of sisters Jennifer has, which is 6.\n2. Since Jennifer's brothers are also siblings, they will have the same number of sisters as Jennifer.\n3. Output the number of sisters Jennifer's brother has in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Jennifer has\nsisters = 6\n\n# Output the number of sisters Jennifer's brother has\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters}>>>\")\n```"
