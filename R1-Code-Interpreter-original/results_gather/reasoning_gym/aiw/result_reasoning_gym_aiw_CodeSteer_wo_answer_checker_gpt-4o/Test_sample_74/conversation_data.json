  "question": "Jessica has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jessica has. All these mentioned persons around Jessica are colleagues of each other. James has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Jessica, being part of Jessica's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Jessica has 5 male and 5 female colleagues. This means there are 11 people in Jessica's circle, including Jessica herself.\n\n2. James has 4 male and 1 female colleague. This means there are 6 people in James's circle, including James himself.\n\n3. Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jessica and James. Therefore, she is part of both circles.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Jessica's circle, there are 5 female colleagues (including Matilda).\n- In James's circle, there is 1 female colleague (which is Matilda herself).\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to count the unique female colleagues she has. The only female colleague in James's circle is Matilda herself, so we don't count her again. Therefore, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues from Jessica's circle.\n\nLet's write the Python code to output the answer:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Jessica's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_jessica = 5 - 1  # Excluding Matilda herself\n\n# Matilda's female colleagues are those in Jessica's circle excluding herself\nmatilda_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_jessica\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",
    "Thank you for the confirmation. Based on the analysis, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 4. Here's the final Python code to output the answer:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Jessica's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_jessica = 5 - 1  # Excluding Matilda herself\n\n# Matilda's female colleagues are those in Jessica's circle excluding herself\nmatilda_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_jessica\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```"
