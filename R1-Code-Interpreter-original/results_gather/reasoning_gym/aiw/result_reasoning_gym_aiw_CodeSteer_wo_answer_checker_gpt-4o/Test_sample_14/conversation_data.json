  "question": "Susan has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Susan has. All these mentioned persons around Susan are colleagues of each other. James has 2 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Susan, being part of Susan's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Susan has 5 male and 5 female colleagues. This means Susan's circle has 11 people in total (including Susan herself).\n\n2. James has 2 male and 6 female colleagues. This means James's circle has 9 people in total (including James himself).\n\n3. Matilda is a common colleague between Susan and James, meaning she is part of both circles.\n\n4. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap. Matilda's female colleagues are those in both Susan's and James's circles, minus any duplicates.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- From Susan's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n- From James's circle, Matilda has 6 female colleagues.\n- Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to subtract her once.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of female colleagues from both circles minus Matilda herself.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Susan's circle\nfemale_colleagues_susan = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in James's circle\nfemale_colleagues_james = 6\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so subtract her once\nmatilda_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_susan + female_colleagues_james - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",
    "Thank you for the feedback. Since the current solution is straightforward and correctly solves the problem, we can proceed with the answer as it is. The code provided calculates the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap between Susan's and James's circles. Here is the final code again for clarity:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Susan's circle\nfemale_colleagues_susan = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in James's circle\nfemale_colleagues_james = 6\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so subtract her once\nmatilda_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_susan + female_colleagues_james - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```"

    "The current approach and code are correct in terms of logic and output. However, the complexity analysis suggests that the code is not complex enough for symbolic computing. In this case, the task does not require symbolic computing or efficient searching, as it is a straightforward arithmetic problem. Therefore, the current solution is sufficient and correct. You can proceed with the answer as it is."
