All these mentioned persons around Elizabeth are colleagues of each other. Joseph has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Elizabeth, being part of Elizabeth's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Elizabeth's circle:\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 2 female colleagues\n   - Total: 4 males + 2 females = 6 colleagues\n\n2. Joseph's circle:\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague\n   - Total: 3 males + 1 female = 4 colleagues\n\n3. Matilda is a special case:\n   - She is part of both Elizabeth's and Joseph's circles.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Elizabeth's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n- In Joseph's circle, there is 1 female colleague.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap. Matilda herself is the only overlap between the two circles, and she is a female colleague in both circles.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues in both circles, minus 1 (to account for Matilda herself being counted twice).\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Elizabeth's circle\nfemale_colleagues_elizabeth = 2\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Joseph's circle\nfemale_colleagues_joseph = 1\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1\ntotal_female_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_elizabeth + female_colleagues_joseph - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{total_female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```"
