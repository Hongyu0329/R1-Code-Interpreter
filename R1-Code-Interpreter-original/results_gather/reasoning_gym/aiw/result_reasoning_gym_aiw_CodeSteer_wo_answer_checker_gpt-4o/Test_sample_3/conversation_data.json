    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female friends David, one of Jennifer's male friends, has. \n\n1. Jennifer has 2 male friends and 3 female friends.\n2. All of Jennifer's friends are friends with each other.\n3. David is one of the male friends.\n\nSince all of Jennifer's friends are friends with each other, David, being one of the male friends, is friends with all of Jennifer's friends, including the 3 female friends.\n\nTherefore, David has 3 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends David has\nfemale_friends_of_david = 3\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_david}>>>\")\n```"
