  "question": "Linda has 5 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Richard has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Richard are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Richard do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Richard and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Linda has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. This means Linda's circle has 5 males + 3 females + Linda herself = 9 people.\n\n2. Richard has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues. This means Richard's circle has 2 males + 4 females + Richard himself = 7 people.\n\n3. Matilda is a unique case because she is part of both Linda's and Richard's circles.\n\n4. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n\n5. Matilda is one of the 4 female colleagues in Richard's circle. The other 3 females in Richard's circle are her female colleagues.\n\n6. Matilda is also one of the 3 female colleagues in Linda's circle. The other 2 females in Linda's circle are her female colleagues.\n\n7. Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\n8. Therefore, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the females in both circles minus Matilda herself.\n\nNow, let's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemales_in_lindas_circle = 3 - 1  # Matilda is one of them\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Richard's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemales_in_richards_circle = 4 - 1  # Matilda is one of them\n\n# Total number of female colleagues Matilda has\ntotal_female_colleagues = females_in_lindas_circle + females_in_richards_circle\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{total_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",

    "The current solution correctly calculates the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap between Linda's and Richard's circles. The code is simple and directly addresses the problem without unnecessary complexity. Since the answer is correct and the code effectively solves the task, there is no need for more complex symbolic computing or efficient searching in this case. Therefore, the current solution is sufficient."
