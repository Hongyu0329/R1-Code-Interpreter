    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Robert's brother has. \n\n1. Margaret has 6 sisters and 3 brothers. \n2. Since Robert is one of Margaret's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Margaret.\n3. Therefore, Robert's brother would also have the same number of sisters as Margaret.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Margaret has\nsisters_of_margaret = 6\n\n# Since Robert is one of Margaret's brothers, he has the same number of sisters\nsisters_of_roberts_brother = sisters_of_margaret\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_roberts_brother}>>>\")\n```"
