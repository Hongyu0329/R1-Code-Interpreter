    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Alice's friends. Alice has 3 male friends and 4 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each male friend, including Michael, is friends with all the female friends of Alice.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Alice has, which is 4.\n2. Since all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, Michael, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 4 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the number of female friends Michael has.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Alice has\nfemale_friends_of_alice = 4\n\n# Since Michael is friends with all of Alice's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_michael = female_friends_of_alice\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_michael}>>>\")\n```"
