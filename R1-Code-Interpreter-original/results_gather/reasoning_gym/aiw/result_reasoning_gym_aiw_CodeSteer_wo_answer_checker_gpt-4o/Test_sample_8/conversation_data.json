    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Sarah's friends. Sarah has 2 male friends and 3 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each of Sarah's male friends is also friends with all of Sarah's female friends.\n\nSince James is one of the male friends of Sarah, he is friends with all 3 of Sarah's female friends. Therefore, James has 3 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Sarah has\nfemale_friends_of_sarah = 3\n\n# Since James is friends with all of Sarah's female friends\nfemale_friends_of_james = female_friends_of_sarah\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_james}>>>\")\n```"
