    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Jennifer and Bob. The problem states that Jennifer has 2 sisters and 6 brothers. This means Jennifer is one of the siblings, and she has 2 sisters, making a total of 3 sisters including herself. \n\nSince Jennifer and Bob are siblings, Bob has the same number of sisters as Jennifer. Therefore, Bob's brother (who is also Bob) would have the same number of sisters as Jennifer.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of sisters Jennifer has, which is 2.\n2. Since Bob is Jennifer's brother, he has the same number of sisters.\n3. Output the number of sisters Bob's brother has.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Jennifer has\njennifer_sisters = 2\n\n# Since Bob is Jennifer's brother, he has the same number of sisters\nbobs_brother_sisters = jennifer_sisters\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{bobs_brother_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
