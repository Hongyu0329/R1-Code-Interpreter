    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Margaret's brothers have. Since Margaret has 1 sister, and she herself is also a sister, we can conclude that each of Margaret's brothers has 2 sisters (Margaret and her one sister).\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of sisters Margaret has, which is 1.\n2. Include Margaret herself as a sister.\n3. Calculate the total number of sisters Margaret's brothers have.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Margaret has\nsisters_of_margaret = 1\n\n# Including Margaret herself\ntotal_sisters = sisters_of_margaret + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
