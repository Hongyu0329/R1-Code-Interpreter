    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described. \n\n1. Jennifer has 2 sisters and 4 brothers. This means Jennifer is one of the sisters, so there are 3 sisters in total (Jennifer + 2 sisters).\n2. Michael is one of Jennifer's brothers. Therefore, Michael has the same number of sisters as Jennifer does.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the number of sisters Michael's brother has.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Jennifer has\njennifer_sisters = 2\n\n# Including Jennifer herself, the total number of sisters is:\ntotal_sisters = jennifer_sisters + 1\n\n# Michael, being one of Jennifer's brothers, has the same number of sisters\nmichaels_brother_sisters = total_sisters\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{michaels_brother_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
