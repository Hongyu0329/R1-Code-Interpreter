    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Elizabeth's friends. Elizabeth has 6 male friends and 2 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each of Elizabeth's male friends, including David, is friends with all of Elizabeth's female friends.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Elizabeth has. According to the problem, Elizabeth has 2 female friends.\n2. Since all of Elizabeth's friends are friends with each other, David, being one of the male friends, is also friends with these 2 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Elizabeth has\nfemale_friends = 2\n\n# Since David is friends with all of Elizabeth's friends, he has the same number of female friends\ndavid_female_friends = female_friends\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{david_female_friends}>>>\")\n```"
