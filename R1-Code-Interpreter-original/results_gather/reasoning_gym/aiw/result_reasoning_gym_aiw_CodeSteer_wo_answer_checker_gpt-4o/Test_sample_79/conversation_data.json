  "question": "Linda has 4 male colleagues and she also has 2 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. David has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around David are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around David do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of David and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Linda has 4 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues. This means Linda's circle consists of 7 people in total (including Linda herself).\n\n2. David has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues. This means David's circle consists of 9 people in total (including David himself).\n\n3. Matilda is a unique case because she is part of both Linda's and David's circles.\n\nTo find out how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to consider the overlap between Linda's and David's circles. Since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Linda and David, we can deduce the following:\n\n- In Linda's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n- In David's circle, there are 4 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to count the unique female colleagues she has. Matilda herself is one of the female colleagues in both circles. Therefore, we need to find the union of the female colleagues from both circles, excluding Matilda herself.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_linda = 2\n\n# Number of female colleagues in David's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_david = 4\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double counting\nunique_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_linda + female_colleagues_david - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{unique_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and excluding Matilda herself from being double-counted.",

    "The current solution correctly calculates the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap between Linda's and David's circles. The code is simple and effective for this task, as it involves basic arithmetic operations to account for the overlap. Therefore, the current approach is sufficient, and no further complexity is needed."
