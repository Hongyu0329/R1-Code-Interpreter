    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Linda has 4 male friends and 5 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each male friend, including Robert, is friends with all the female friends of Linda.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Linda has.\n2. Since all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, Robert, being one of the male friends, will also be friends with all of Linda's female friends.\n3. Therefore, the number of female friends Robert has is the same as the number of female friends Linda has.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Linda has\nfemale_friends_of_linda = 5\n\n# Since Robert is friends with all of Linda's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_robert = female_friends_of_linda\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_robert}>>>\")\n```"

If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Linda has 4 male friends and she also has 5 female friends.
