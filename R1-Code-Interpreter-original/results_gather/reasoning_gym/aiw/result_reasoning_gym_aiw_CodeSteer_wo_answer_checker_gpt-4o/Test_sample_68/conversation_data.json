    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Jessica and Robert. The problem states that Jessica has 4 sisters and 6 brothers. This means that Jessica is one of the siblings, so the total number of sisters is 5 (including Jessica herself).\n\nSince Robert is one of Jessica's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Jessica. Therefore, Robert's brother (which could be Robert himself or one of his other brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Jessica does.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sisters Jessica has, which includes herself.\n2. Since Robert is one of Jessica's brothers, he has the same number of sisters.\n3. Output the number of sisters Robert's brother has in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Jessica has (including herself)\ntotal_sisters = 4 + 1  # 4 sisters + Jessica\n\n# Output the number of sisters Robert's brother has\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
