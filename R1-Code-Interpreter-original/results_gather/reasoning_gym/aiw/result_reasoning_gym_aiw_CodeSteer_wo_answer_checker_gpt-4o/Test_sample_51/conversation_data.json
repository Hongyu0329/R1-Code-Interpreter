    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female friends John, one of Jessica's male friends, has. \n\n1. Jessica has 2 male friends and 4 female friends.\n2. All of Jessica's friends are friends with each other.\n3. John is one of the male friends.\n\nSince all of Jessica's friends are friends with each other, John, being one of the male friends, is friends with all of Jessica's female friends. Therefore, John has 4 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Jessica has\nfemale_friends_of_jessica = 4\n\n# Since John is friends with all of Jessica's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_john = female_friends_of_jessica\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_john}>>>\")\n```"
