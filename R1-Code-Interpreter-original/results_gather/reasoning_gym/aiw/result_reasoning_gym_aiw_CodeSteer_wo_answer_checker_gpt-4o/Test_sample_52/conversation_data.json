Joseph has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. We know that Matilda is part of both Mary's and Joseph's circles of colleagues.\n\n1. **Mary's Circle**: \n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 5 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 colleagues\n\n2. **Joseph's Circle**:\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 9 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Position**:\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Mary and Joseph.\n   - Therefore, she is counted in both circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues**:\n   - In Mary's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues (since all females in Mary's circle are her colleagues).\n   - In Joseph's circle, Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap. Matilda is already counted as a female colleague in Joseph's circle, so we don't double-count her.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues in Mary's circle and the female colleagues in Joseph's circle, minus 1 (since Matilda is counted in both circles).\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Mary's circle\nmary_female_colleagues = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Joseph's circle\njoseph_female_colleagues = 3\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so subtract 1\nmatilda_female_colleagues = mary_female_colleagues + joseph_female_colleagues - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```"
