    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Margaret's friends. Margaret has 4 male friends and 2 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each of Margaret's male friends, including Charles, is friends with all of Margaret's friends.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Margaret has 4 male friends: Charles and 3 others.\n2. Margaret has 2 female friends.\n3. Since all of Margaret's friends are friends with each other, Charles, being one of the male friends, is friends with all of Margaret's female friends.\n\nTherefore, Charles has 2 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Charles has\nfemale_friends_of_charles = 2\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_charles}>>>\")\n```"
