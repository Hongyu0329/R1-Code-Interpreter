    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described:\n\n1. Sarah has 3 sisters. This means Sarah is one of the sisters, so there are 4 sisters in total.\n2. Sarah also has 3 brothers.\n3. We need to determine how many sisters Richard's brother has.\n\nAssuming Richard is one of Sarah's brothers, Richard's brother would be one of Sarah's brothers as well. Therefore, Richard's brother would have the same number of sisters as Sarah does.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the number of sisters Richard's brother has.\n\n```python\n# Sarah has 3 sisters, including herself, there are 4 sisters in total.\nsisters = 3 + 1\n\n# Richard's brother has the same number of sisters as Sarah.\nrichards_brothers_sisters = sisters\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{richards_brothers_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
