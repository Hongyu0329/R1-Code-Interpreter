    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described. \n\n1. Linda has 3 sisters and 1 brother. This means Linda is one of the sisters, so there are 4 sisters in total (including Linda herself).\n\n2. The question asks how many sisters Thomas's brother has. Since Thomas is Linda's brother, Thomas's brother is also Linda's brother. Therefore, Thomas's brother has the same number of sisters as Linda does.\n\n3. Since Linda has 4 sisters, Thomas's brother also has 4 sisters.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Linda has\nlinda_sisters = 3\n\n# Including Linda herself\ntotal_sisters = linda_sisters + 1\n\n# Output the answer\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
