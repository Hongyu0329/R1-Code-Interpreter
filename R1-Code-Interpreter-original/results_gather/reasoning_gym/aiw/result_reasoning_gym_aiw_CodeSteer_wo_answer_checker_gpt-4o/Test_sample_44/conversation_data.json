    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Susan's friends. Susan has 3 male friends and 1 female friend. All of these friends are friends with each other and have no other friends aside. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Susan's male friends: Michael, and two other males.\n2. Susan's female friend: One female friend.\n\nSince all of Susan's friends are friends with each other, Michael, being one of the male friends, is also friends with the female friend. Therefore, Michael has 1 female friend.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Michael has 1 female friend\nfemale_friends_of_michael = 1\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_michael}>>>\")\n```"
