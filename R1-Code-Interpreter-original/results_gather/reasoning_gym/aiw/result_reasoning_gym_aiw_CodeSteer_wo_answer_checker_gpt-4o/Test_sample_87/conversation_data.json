  "question": "Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues. This means Jennifer's circle has a total of 12 people (including Jennifer herself).\n\n2. Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague. This means Thomas's circle has a total of 6 people (including Thomas himself).\n\n3. Matilda is a unique case because she is part of both Jennifer's and Thomas's circles.\n\n4. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n\n5. Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jennifer and Thomas, so she is counted in both circles.\n\n6. In Jennifer's circle, there are 5 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n\n7. In Thomas's circle, there is 1 female colleague, which is Matilda herself.\n\n8. Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle, excluding Matilda herself.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle\nfemale_colleagues_jennifer = 5\n\n# Matilda is one of the female colleagues, so we exclude her\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_jennifer - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```"
