    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Jennifer's friends. Jennifer has 6 male friends and 5 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each male friend, including Thomas, is friends with all of Jennifer's female friends.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Jennifer has.\n2. Since all of Jennifer's friends are friends with each other, Thomas, being one of the male friends, is friends with all of Jennifer's female friends.\n3. Therefore, the number of female friends Thomas has is equal to the number of Jennifer's female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Jennifer has\nfemale_friends_of_jennifer = 5\n\n# Since Thomas is friends with all of Jennifer's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_thomas = female_friends_of_jennifer\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_thomas}>>>\")\n```"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Jennifer has 6 male friends and she also has 5 female friends.
