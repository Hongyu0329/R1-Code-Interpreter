    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Alice's friends. Alice has 5 male friends and 3 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, meaning each male friend is also friends with all the female friends.\n\nSince Charles is one of Alice's male friends, he is friends with all of Alice's female friends. Therefore, Charles has 3 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Alice has\nfemale_friends_of_alice = 3\n\n# Since Charles is one of Alice's male friends, he is friends with all of Alice's female friends\nfemale_friends_of_charles = female_friends_of_alice\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_charles}>>>\")\n```"
