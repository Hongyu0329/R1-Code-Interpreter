    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Michael's brother has. \n\n1. Susan has 3 sisters and 4 brothers. This means Susan is one of the sisters, so there are 4 sisters in total (Susan + 3 sisters).\n2. Michael is one of Susan's brothers. Therefore, Michael's brother is also one of Susan's brothers.\n3. Since Susan has 4 sisters, Michael's brother also has 4 sisters.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Susan has\nsisters_of_susan = 3\n\n# Including Susan herself, total number of sisters\ntotal_sisters = sisters_of_susan + 1\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
