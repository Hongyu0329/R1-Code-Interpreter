  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Patricia and Joseph. The problem states that Patricia has 5 sisters and 6 brothers. This means Patricia is one of the siblings, so the total number of sisters is 5, including Patricia herself.\n\nNow, Joseph is one of Patricia's brothers. Since they share the same family, Joseph has the same number of sisters as Patricia does. Therefore, Joseph's brother (which is Joseph himself) also has 5 sisters.\n\nLet's write a Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Patricia has\nsisters_of_patricia = 5\n\n# Since Joseph is one of Patricia's brothers, he has the same number of sisters\nsisters_of_joseph = sisters_of_patricia\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_joseph}>>>\")\n```"
