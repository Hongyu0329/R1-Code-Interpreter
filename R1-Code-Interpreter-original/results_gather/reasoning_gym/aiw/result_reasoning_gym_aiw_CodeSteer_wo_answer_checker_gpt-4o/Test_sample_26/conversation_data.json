    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda and her friends. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Linda has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of Linda's friends are friends with each other.\n3. Bob is one of the male friends of Linda.\n\nSince all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, Bob, being one of the male friends, will also be friends with Linda's female friend. Therefore, Bob has 1 female friend.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Bob has 1 female friend, who is also Linda's female friend.\nfemale_friends_of_bob = 1\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_bob}>>>\")\n```"
