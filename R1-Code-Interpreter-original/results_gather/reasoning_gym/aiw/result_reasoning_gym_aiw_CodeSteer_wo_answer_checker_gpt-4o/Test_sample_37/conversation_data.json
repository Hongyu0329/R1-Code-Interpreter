All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. Robert has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Robert are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Robert do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Robert and she is also colleague of Patricia, being part of Patricia's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Patricia has 1 male colleague and 5 female colleagues. This means Patricia's circle consists of 1 male + 5 females + Patricia herself = 7 people.\n\n2. Robert has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. This means Robert's circle consists of 3 males + 3 females + Robert himself = 7 people.\n\n3. Matilda is a special case because she is a colleague of both Robert and Patricia. This means she is counted in both circles.\n\nTo find out how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to consider the overlap and the unique members in each circle:\n\n- Matilda is part of Patricia's circle, which has 5 female colleagues.\n- Matilda is also part of Robert's circle, which has 3 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her. Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues in both circles minus Matilda herself.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- Total female colleagues in Patricia's circle: 5\n- Total female colleagues in Robert's circle: 3\n- Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Patricia's circle\npatricia_female_colleagues = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Robert's circle\nrobert_female_colleagues = 3\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so subtract 1\nmatilda_female_colleagues = patricia_female_colleagues + robert_female_colleagues - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",
    "You're right. The problem can be simplified by focusing on the fact that Matilda is part of Robert's circle, and all members of Robert's circle are colleagues of each other. Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is simply the number of female colleagues in Robert's circle. Let's adjust the solution accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Robert's circle\nrobert_female_colleagues = 3\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{robert_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```"

    "The current solution seems to be overcomplicating the problem. The task can be solved using simple logical reasoning without the need for complex symbolic computing. Matilda is part of both Patricia's and Robert's circles. Since she is a female colleague herself, the number of female colleagues she has is simply the number of female colleagues in Robert's circle, as they are all colleagues of each other. Therefore, the correct answer is the number of female colleagues in Robert's circle, which is 3. Please adjust the solution to reflect this simpler reasoning."
