James has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Sarah's circle:\n   - 2 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague (Matilda)\n   - Total: 3 colleagues (including Matilda)\n\n2. James's circle:\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n   - Total: 7 colleagues\n\n3. Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Sarah and James.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Sarah's circle, Matilda is the only female colleague.\n- In James's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the number of female colleagues in James's circle minus Matilda herself.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in James's circle\ntotal_female_colleagues_james = 3\n\n# Matilda is one of the female colleagues\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = total_female_colleagues_james - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```"
