    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships between Margaret and her friends. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Margaret has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of them are friends with each other, meaning each of Margaret's friends is also friends with the other two.\n3. James is one of the male friends of Margaret.\n4. Since there is only one female friend in the group, and all are friends with each other, James will have exactly 1 female friend.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends James has\nfemale_friends_of_james = 1\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_james}>>>\")\n```"
