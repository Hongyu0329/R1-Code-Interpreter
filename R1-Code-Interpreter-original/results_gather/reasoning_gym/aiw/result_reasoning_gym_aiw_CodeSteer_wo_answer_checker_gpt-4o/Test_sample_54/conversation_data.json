  "question": "Mary has 3 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Mary has. All these mentioned persons around Mary are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 1 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 3 males + 6 females = 9 colleagues\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 1 female colleague\n   - Total: 1 male + 1 female = 2 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Role:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Mary's and Thomas's circles.\n   - She is the only person who connects both circles.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Mary's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n- Matilda is one of these female colleagues.\n- In Thomas's circle, there is 1 female colleague, which is Matilda herself.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to count the female colleagues in Mary's circle, excluding Matilda herself, because she cannot be her own colleague.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the number of female colleagues in Mary's circle minus Matilda herself.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Mary's circle\nfemale_colleagues_mary = 6\n\n# Matilda is one of these female colleagues\n# So, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_mary - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```"
