    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Susan's friends. Susan has 4 male friends and 5 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means each male friend, including Thomas, is friends with all 5 female friends.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Susan has.\n2. Since all of Susan's friends are friends with each other, each male friend, including Thomas, is friends with all of Susan's female friends.\n3. Therefore, Thomas has the same number of female friends as Susan has.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Susan has\nfemale_friends_of_susan = 5\n\n# Since Thomas is friends with all of Susan's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_thomas = female_friends_of_susan\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_thomas}>>>\")\n```"
