Michael has 1 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Michael and she is also colleague of Barbara, being part of Barbara's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Barbara's circle:\n   - 2 male colleagues\n   - 2 female colleagues\n   - Total: 4 colleagues (including Barbara herself)\n\n2. Michael's circle:\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 4 colleagues (including Michael himself)\n\n3. Matilda is a part of both Barbara's and Michael's circles.\n\nNow, let's identify Matilda's colleagues:\n\n- From Barbara's circle, Matilda has 2 male and 2 female colleagues.\n- From Michael's circle, Matilda has 1 male and 3 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her. However, the problem states that all people in each circle are colleagues of each other, so we can assume that the circles overlap only at Matilda.\n\nTherefore, Matilda's female colleagues are the sum of the female colleagues from both circles, minus Matilda herself (since she is counted in both circles).\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Barbara's circle\nfemale_colleagues_barbara = 2\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Michael's circle\nfemale_colleagues_michael = 3\n\n# Total female colleagues Matilda has, excluding herself\ntotal_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_barbara + female_colleagues_michael - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{total_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",

    "The current solution correctly calculates the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap between Barbara's and Michael's circles. The code is simple and effective for this problem, as it directly addresses the task requirements without unnecessary complexity. Therefore, the current answer is correct and sufficient."
