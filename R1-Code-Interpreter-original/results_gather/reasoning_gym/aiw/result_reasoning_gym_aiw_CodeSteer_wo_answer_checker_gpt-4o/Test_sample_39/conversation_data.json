    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Margaret's brother has. \n\n1. Margaret has 2 sisters.\n2. Since Margaret is also a sister to her brothers, we need to include her in the count of sisters.\n3. Therefore, each of Margaret's brothers has 2 sisters (Margaret's sisters) plus Margaret herself.\n\nSo, the total number of sisters each brother has is 2 (Margaret's sisters) + 1 (Margaret) = 3.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this result in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Margaret has\nsisters_of_margaret = 2\n\n# Including Margaret herself\ntotal_sisters_for_brother = sisters_of_margaret + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters_for_brother}>>>\")\n```"
