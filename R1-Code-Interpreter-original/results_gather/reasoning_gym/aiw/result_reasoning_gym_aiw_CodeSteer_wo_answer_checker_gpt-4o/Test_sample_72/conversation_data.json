  "question": "Linda has 4 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Michael has 1 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Michael and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Linda has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. This means Linda's circle has 8 people in total (including Linda herself).\n\n2. Michael has 1 male colleague and 6 female colleagues. This means Michael's circle has 8 people in total (including Michael himself).\n\n3. Matilda is a part of both Linda's and Michael's circles.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Linda's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n- In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider her only once. Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the total number of unique female colleagues in both circles.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle\nfemale_colleagues_linda = 3\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Michael's circle\nfemale_colleagues_michael = 6\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her\ntotal_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_linda + female_colleagues_michael - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{total_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem accurately, we need to consider the overlap between Linda's and Michael's circles and ensure that Matilda is not double-counted. We can use set operations to handle the uniqueness of colleagues in both circles.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Define the sets of female colleagues for both Linda and Michael.\n2. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to ensure she is not double-counted.\n3. Use set operations to find the union of female colleagues in both circles, excluding Matilda.\n4. The size of this union will give us the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the sets of female colleagues for Linda and Michael\nfemale_colleagues_linda = {\"F1\", \"F2\", \"F3\", \"Matilda\"}\nfemale_colleagues_michael = {\"F4\", \"F5\", \"F6\", \"F7\", \"Matilda\"}\n\n# Find the union of both sets, excluding Matilda\nunique_female_colleagues = (female_colleagues_linda | female_colleagues_michael) - {\"Matilda\"}\n\n# Output the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has\nprint(f\"<<<{len(unique_female_colleagues)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses set operations to ensure that we count each female colleague only once, and it excludes Matilda from being double-counted. The result will give us the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has."

    "The current approach is overly simplistic and does not account for the unique relationships between the colleagues. Consider using a more complex approach that involves symbolic computing or efficient searching to accurately determine the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has. Specifically, you should account for the overlap in the circles and ensure that Matilda is not double-counted. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, possibly using set operations to handle the uniqueness of colleagues in both circles."
