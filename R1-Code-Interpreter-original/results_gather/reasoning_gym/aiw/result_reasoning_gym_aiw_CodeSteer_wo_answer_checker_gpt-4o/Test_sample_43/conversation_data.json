    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Susan's friends. Susan has 1 male friend and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends aside from this group.\n\nSince Joseph is the male friend of Susan, he is friends with all of Susan's friends, which includes the 6 female friends. Therefore, Joseph has 6 female friends.\n\nLet's write a Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Joseph has\nfemale_friends_of_joseph = 6\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_joseph}>>>\")\n```"
