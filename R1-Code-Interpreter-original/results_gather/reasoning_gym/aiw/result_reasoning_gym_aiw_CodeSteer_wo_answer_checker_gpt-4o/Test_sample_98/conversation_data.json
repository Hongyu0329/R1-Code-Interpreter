    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Elizabeth's friends. Elizabeth has 4 male friends and 6 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each male friend, including Bob, is friends with all of Elizabeth's female friends.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Elizabeth has.\n2. Since all of Elizabeth's friends are friends with each other, each male friend, including Bob, is friends with all of Elizabeth's female friends.\n3. Therefore, the number of female friends Bob has is equal to the number of Elizabeth's female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Elizabeth has\nfemale_friends_of_elizabeth = 6\n\n# Since Bob is friends with all of Elizabeth's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_bob = female_friends_of_elizabeth\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_bob}>>>\")\n```"
