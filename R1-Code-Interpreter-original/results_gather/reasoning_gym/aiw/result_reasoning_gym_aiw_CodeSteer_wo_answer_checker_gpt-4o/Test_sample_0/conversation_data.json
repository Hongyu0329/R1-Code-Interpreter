    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Linda's brother has. \n\n1. Linda has 6 sisters.\n2. Since Linda is also a sister, we need to include her in the count of sisters.\n3. Therefore, each of Linda's brothers has 6 sisters, including Linda herself.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Linda has\nsisters = 6\n\n# Including Linda herself\ntotal_sisters = sisters + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
