    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Patricia's friends. Patricia has 3 male friends and 4 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each male friend, including William, is friends with all the female friends.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Patricia has, which is 4.\n2. Since all friends are friends with each other, William, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 4 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the number of female friends William has.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Patricia has\nfemale_friends = 4\n\n# Since William is friends with all of them\nwilliam_female_friends = female_friends\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{william_female_friends}>>>\")\n```"
