    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Sarah's brother has. \n\n1. Sarah has 3 sisters.\n2. Since Sarah's brother is also Sarah's sibling, he shares the same number of sisters as Sarah does.\n\nTherefore, Sarah's brother has 3 sisters.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Sarah has\nsisters_of_sarah = 3\n\n# Since Sarah's brother is also her sibling, he has the same number of sisters\nsisters_of_brother = sisters_of_sarah\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_brother}>>>\")\n```"
