    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Linda has 5 male friends and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, meaning each male friend is friends with all 6 female friends.\n\nSince Joseph is one of Linda's male friends, he is friends with all of Linda's female friends. Therefore, Joseph has 6 female friends.\n\nLet's write a Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Linda has\nfemale_friends_of_linda = 6\n\n# Joseph, being one of Linda's male friends, is friends with all of Linda's female friends\nfemale_friends_of_joseph = female_friends_of_linda\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_joseph}>>>\")\n```"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Linda has 5 male friends and she also has 6 female friends.
