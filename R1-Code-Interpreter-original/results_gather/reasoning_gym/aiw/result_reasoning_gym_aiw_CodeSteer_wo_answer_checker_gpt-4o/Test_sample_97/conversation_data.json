    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Sarah's friends. Sarah has 1 male friend (William) and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nSince William is friends with all of Sarah's friends, and Sarah has 6 female friends, William also has 6 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Sarah has\nfemale_friends_of_sarah = 6\n\n# Since William is friends with all of Sarah's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_william = female_friends_of_sarah\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_william}>>>\")\n```"
