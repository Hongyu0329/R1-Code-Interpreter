    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Patricia's brothers have. Since Patricia has 1 sister, and she is also a sister to her brothers, we can conclude that Patricia's brothers have 2 sisters in total: Patricia herself and her other sister.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of sisters Patricia has, which is 1.\n2. Include Patricia herself as a sister to her brothers.\n3. Calculate the total number of sisters Patricia's brothers have.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Patricia has\nsisters_of_patricia = 1\n\n# Including Patricia herself as a sister\ntotal_sisters_for_brothers = sisters_of_patricia + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters_for_brothers}>>>\")\n```"
