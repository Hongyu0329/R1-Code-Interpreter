All these mentioned persons around Margaret are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 1 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Margaret, being part of Margaret's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Margaret's circle:\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 + 3 = 9 colleagues\n\n2. Thomas's circle:\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 1 + 6 = 7 colleagues\n\n3. Matilda is a colleague of both Margaret and Thomas, meaning she is part of both circles.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to find out how many female colleagues she has. We know that:\n\n- In Margaret's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n- In Thomas's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider the overlap. Matilda herself is one of the female colleagues in both circles. Therefore, the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of female colleagues in both circles minus Matilda herself.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Margaret's circle\nfemale_colleagues_margaret = 3\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Thomas's circle\nfemale_colleagues_thomas = 6\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her\nunique_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_margaret + female_colleagues_thomas - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{unique_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```"
