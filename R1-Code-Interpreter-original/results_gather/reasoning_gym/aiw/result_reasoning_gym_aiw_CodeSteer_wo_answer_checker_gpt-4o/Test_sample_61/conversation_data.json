Charles has 1 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Jessica, being part of Jessica's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Jessica has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. This means there are 10 people in Jessica's circle, including Jessica herself.\n\n2. Charles has 1 male colleague and 1 female colleague. This means there are 3 people in Charles's circle, including Charles himself.\n\n3. Matilda is a special case because she is a colleague of both Charles and Jessica. This means she is counted in both circles.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Jessica's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n- In Charles's circle, there is 1 female colleague, which is Matilda herself.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to find out how many female colleagues she has, excluding herself.\n\nPlan:\n- Count the number of female colleagues in Jessica's circle.\n- Subtract Matilda from this count because we are looking for her colleagues, not including herself.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Jessica's circle\nfemale_colleagues_jessica = 3\n\n# Matilda is one of the female colleagues, so we subtract her\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_jessica - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```"
