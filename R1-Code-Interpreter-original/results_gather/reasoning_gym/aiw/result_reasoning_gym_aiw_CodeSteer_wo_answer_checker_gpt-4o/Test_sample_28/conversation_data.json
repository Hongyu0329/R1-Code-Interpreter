    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Robert's brother has. \n\n1. Margaret has 2 sisters and 3 brothers. \n2. Since Margaret is one of the sisters, the total number of sisters in the family is 3 (Margaret + 2 sisters).\n3. Robert is one of Margaret's brothers. Therefore, Robert's brother is also one of Margaret's brothers.\n4. Since all siblings share the same sisters, Robert's brother has the same number of sisters as Margaret.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Margaret has\nsisters_margaret_has = 2\n\n# Including Margaret herself, the total number of sisters in the family\ntotal_sisters = sisters_margaret_has + 1\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
