    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Elizabeth's friends. Elizabeth has 2 male friends and 4 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means that each of Elizabeth's male friends is also friends with all of Elizabeth's female friends.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Elizabeth has 2 male friends: Thomas and another male friend.\n2. Elizabeth has 4 female friends.\n3. Since all of Elizabeth's friends are friends with each other, Thomas, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 4 of Elizabeth's female friends.\n\nTherefore, Thomas has 4 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Thomas has\nfemale_friends_of_thomas = 4\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_thomas}>>>\")\n```"
