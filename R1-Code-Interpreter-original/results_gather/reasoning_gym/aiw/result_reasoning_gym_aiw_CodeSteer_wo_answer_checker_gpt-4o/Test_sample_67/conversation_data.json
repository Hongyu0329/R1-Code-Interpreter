    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Linda has 2 male friends and 2 female friends.\n2. All of Linda's friends are friends with each other.\n3. Charles is one of the male friends of Linda.\n\nSince all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, Charles, being one of the male friends, is also friends with the 2 female friends of Linda. Therefore, Charles has 2 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Charles has\nfemale_friends_of_charles = 2\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_charles}>>>\")\n```"
