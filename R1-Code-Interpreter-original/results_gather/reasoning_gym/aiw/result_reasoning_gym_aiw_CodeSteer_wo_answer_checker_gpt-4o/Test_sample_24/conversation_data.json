James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Sarah has 4 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues. This means Sarah's circle has 4 males + 6 females = 10 colleagues in total.\n\n2. James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. This means James's circle has 5 males + 3 females = 8 colleagues in total.\n\n3. Matilda is a special case because she is a colleague of both Sarah and James. Therefore, she is counted in both circles.\n\n4. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n\n5. Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues in James's circle. Therefore, the other 2 females in James's circle are also her colleagues.\n\n6. In Sarah's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, including Matilda. Therefore, the other 5 females in Sarah's circle are also her colleagues.\n\n7. Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her. The total number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the females in both circles minus Matilda herself.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- Females in Sarah's circle (excluding Matilda): 5\n- Females in James's circle (excluding Matilda): 2\n\nTotal female colleagues Matilda has = 5 (from Sarah's circle) + 2 (from James's circle) = 7\n\nLet's write the Python code to output this result:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Sarah's circle excluding Matilda\nfemales_in_sarah_circle = 6 - 1\n\n# Number of female colleagues in James's circle excluding Matilda\nfemales_in_james_circle = 3 - 1\n\n# Total number of female colleagues Matilda has\ntotal_female_colleagues = females_in_sarah_circle + females_in_james_circle\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{total_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```"
