    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female friends Bob, a male friend of Linda, has. \n\n1. Linda has 6 male friends and 5 female friends.\n2. All of Linda's friends are friends with each other.\n3. Bob is one of the 6 male friends.\n\nSince all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, Bob, being one of the male friends, is friends with all of Linda's female friends. Therefore, Bob has 5 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Linda has\nfemale_friends_of_Linda = 5\n\n# Since all friends are friends with each other, Bob has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_Bob = female_friends_of_Linda\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_Bob}>>>\")\n```"
