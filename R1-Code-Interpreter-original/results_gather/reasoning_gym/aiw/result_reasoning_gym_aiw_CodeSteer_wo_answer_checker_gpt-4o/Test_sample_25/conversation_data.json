    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Charles's brother has. \n\n1. Margaret has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means Margaret's brother has 2 sisters (Margaret and her other sister).\n2. Since Charles is Margaret's brother, Charles's brother is also Margaret's brother.\n3. Therefore, Charles's brother has the same number of sisters as Margaret's brother, which is 2.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\nsisters_of_charles_brother = 2\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_charles_brother}>>>\")\n```"
