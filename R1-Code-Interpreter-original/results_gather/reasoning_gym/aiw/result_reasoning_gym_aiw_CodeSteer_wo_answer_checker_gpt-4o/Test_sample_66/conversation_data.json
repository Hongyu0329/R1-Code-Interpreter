    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the friends. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Mary has 4 male friends and 1 female friend.\n2. All of them are friends with each other.\n3. David is one of the male friends.\n\nSince all of Mary's friends are friends with each other, David, being one of the male friends, will also be friends with all of Mary's friends, including the 1 female friend.\n\nTherefore, David has 1 female friend.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends David has\nfemale_friends_of_david = 1\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_david}>>>\")\n```"
