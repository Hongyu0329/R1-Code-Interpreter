    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Alice's friends. Alice has 4 male friends and 5 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means each male friend, including Charles, is friends with all 5 female friends of Alice.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Alice has.\n2. Since all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, each male friend, including Charles, is friends with all of Alice's female friends.\n3. Therefore, the number of female friends Charles has is equal to the number of female friends Alice has.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Alice has\nfemale_friends_of_alice = 5\n\n# Since Charles is friends with all of Alice's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_charles = female_friends_of_alice\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_charles}>>>\")\n```"
