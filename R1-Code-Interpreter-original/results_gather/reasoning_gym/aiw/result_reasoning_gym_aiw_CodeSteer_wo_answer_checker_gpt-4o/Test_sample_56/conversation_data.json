    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Linda has 2 male friends and 6 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each male friend, including David, is friends with all the female friends.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the total number of female friends Linda has, which is 6.\n2. Since all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, David, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 6 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Linda has\nfemale_friends = 6\n\n# Since David is friends with all of them\ndavid_female_friends = female_friends\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{david_female_friends}>>>\")\n```"
