Charles has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Barbara, being part of Barbara's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the colleagues of Barbara and Charles, and how Matilda fits into both circles.\n\n1. **Barbara's Circle**: \n   - Barbara has 1 male colleague and 1 female colleague.\n   - Including Barbara herself, the circle has 3 people: Barbara, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\n2. **Charles's Circle**:\n   - Charles has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Including Charles himself, the circle has 9 people: Charles, 3 males, and 5 females.\n\n3. **Matilda's Role**:\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Charles and Barbara.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues**:\n   - In Charles's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Charles's circle, she is one of these 5 females.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 4 female colleagues in Charles's circle (excluding herself).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Charles's circle\ntotal_females_in_charles_circle = 5\n\n# Matilda is one of the females, so her female colleagues are the rest\nmatilda_female_colleagues = total_females_in_charles_circle - 1\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```"
