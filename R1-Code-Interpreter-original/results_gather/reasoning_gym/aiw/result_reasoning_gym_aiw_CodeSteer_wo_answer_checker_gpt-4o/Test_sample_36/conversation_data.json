  "question": "Sarah has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. John has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Sarah has 5 male and 5 female colleagues. This means Sarah's circle has 11 people in total (including Sarah herself).\n\n2. John has 2 male and 4 female colleagues. This means John's circle has 7 people in total (including John himself).\n\n3. Matilda is a unique case because she is a colleague of both Sarah and John. Therefore, she is part of both circles.\n\n4. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n\n5. Since Matilda is part of Sarah's circle, she has 5 female colleagues from Sarah's circle.\n\n6. Since Matilda is part of John's circle, she has 4 female colleagues from John's circle.\n\n7. However, since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- From Sarah's circle: 5 female colleagues\n- From John's circle: 4 female colleagues\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we don't need to add her again. Therefore, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues from both circles.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Sarah's circle\nfemale_colleagues_sarah = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in John's circle\nfemale_colleagues_john = 4\n\n# Total number of female colleagues Matilda has\ntotal_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_sarah + female_colleagues_john\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{total_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",
    "Let's revise the approach to ensure we correctly account for the overlap and do not double-count Matilda.\n\n1. Sarah's circle has 5 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n2. John's circle has 4 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n3. Matilda is counted as a female colleague in both circles, so we need to subtract her once to avoid double-counting.\n\nTo find the unique female colleagues Matilda has, we can add the female colleagues from both circles and subtract 1 for Matilda herself, who is counted in both circles.\n\nHere's the revised calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Sarah's circle, including Matilda\nfemale_colleagues_sarah = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in John's circle, including Matilda\nfemale_colleagues_john = 4\n\n# Subtract 1 to account for Matilda being counted in both circles\ntotal_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_sarah + female_colleagues_john - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{total_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```"

    "The current solution does not account for the overlap correctly. Matilda is counted as a female colleague in both Sarah's and John's circles, but she should not be double-counted. Therefore, the solution should consider the unique female colleagues Matilda has from both circles. Please revise the approach to ensure Matilda is not counted twice and provide a more accurate calculation."
