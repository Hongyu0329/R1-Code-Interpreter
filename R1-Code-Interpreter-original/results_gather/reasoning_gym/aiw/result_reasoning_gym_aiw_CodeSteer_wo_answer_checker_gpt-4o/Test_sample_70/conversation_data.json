    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Margaret's brother has. \n\n1. Margaret has 5 sisters.\n2. Since Margaret is also a sister to her brothers, we need to include her in the count of sisters for her brothers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sisters that Margaret's brother has is 5 (Margaret's sisters) + 1 (Margaret herself) = 6.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Margaret has\nsisters_of_margaret = 5\n\n# Including Margaret herself as a sister to her brothers\nsisters_of_brother = sisters_of_margaret + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_brother}>>>\")\n```"
