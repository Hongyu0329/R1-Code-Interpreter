    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Mary's brother has. \n\n1. Mary has 1 brother and 1 sister.\n2. Since Mary is also a sister to her brother, we need to count Mary as well.\n3. Therefore, Mary's brother has 2 sisters: Mary and the other sister.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Mary has\nmary_sisters = 1\n\n# Including Mary herself as a sister\ntotal_sisters = mary_sisters + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
