  "question": "Linda has 5 male colleagues and she also has 1 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. John has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Linda's circle:\n   - 5 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague (Linda herself)\n   - Matilda is also part of Linda's circle, making it 2 female colleagues in total.\n\n2. John's circle:\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 5 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to find out how many female colleagues she has in John's circle, excluding herself.\n\nPlan:\n- Matilda is one of the 5 female colleagues in John's circle.\n- Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has in John's circle is 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Total female colleagues in John's circle\ntotal_female_colleagues_john = 5\n\n# Matilda is one of them, so subtract 1 to find her female colleagues\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = total_female_colleagues_john - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```",
    "Certainly! To make the code more modular and adaptable for future extensions, we can break down the problem into functions. This approach will allow us to handle more complex scenarios if needed. Here's how we can structure the code:\n\n1. Create a function to calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has in John's circle.\n2. Use this function to get the result and print it.\n\nHere's the enhanced version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_female_colleagues_in_johns_circle(total_female_colleagues):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has in John's circle.\n    \n    :param total_female_colleagues: Total number of female colleagues in John's circle.\n    :return: Number of female colleagues Matilda has, excluding herself.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Matilda is one of the female colleagues, so subtract 1 to find her female colleagues\n    return total_female_colleagues - 1\n\n# Total female colleagues in John's circle\ntotal_female_colleagues_john = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = calculate_female_colleagues_in_johns_circle(total_female_colleagues_john)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis version of the code is more structured and can be easily extended to handle more complex scenarios by adding additional functions or modifying existing ones."

    "The current solution is correct and outputs the expected result. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code is quite simple. While the task itself does not require complex symbolic computing, you can enhance the code by incorporating more detailed comments or by structuring it in a way that could handle more complex scenarios if needed. For instance, consider creating functions to handle different parts of the problem, which could make the code more modular and adaptable for future extensions. However, for this specific task, the current solution is sufficient."
