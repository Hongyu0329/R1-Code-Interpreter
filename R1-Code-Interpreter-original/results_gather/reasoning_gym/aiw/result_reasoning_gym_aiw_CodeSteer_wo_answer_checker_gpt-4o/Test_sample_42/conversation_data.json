John has 3 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Sarah and John, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle**: \n   - Sarah has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 3 males + 1 female = 4 colleagues.\n\n2. **John's Circle**:\n   - John has 3 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 3 males + 2 females = 5 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda**:\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and John.\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, she is counted in both Sarah's and John's circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues**:\n   - In Sarah's circle, there is 1 female colleague (excluding Sarah herself).\n   - In John's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, she shares the female colleagues from both circles.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Matilda has 1 female colleague from Sarah's circle and 2 female colleagues from John's circle.\n   - However, since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 2 female colleagues in total (excluding herself).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has\nsarah_female_colleagues = 1\njohn_female_colleagues = 2\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we consider the unique female colleagues\nmatilda_female_colleagues = sarah_female_colleagues + john_female_colleagues - 1  # Subtract 1 to avoid double-counting Matilda\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",
    "To enhance the complexity and robustness of the solution, we can use sets to represent the social circles of Sarah and John. Sets are ideal for this problem because they automatically handle uniqueness and allow us to easily compute intersections and unions, which are useful for analyzing overlapping social circles.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Define Sets for Social Circles**:\n   - Create a set for Sarah's circle, including her colleagues.\n   - Create a set for John's circle, including his colleagues.\n\n2. **Identify Overlap**:\n   - Use set operations to find the intersection of Sarah's and John's circles, which will help us identify Matilda and any other shared colleagues.\n\n3. **Calculate Female Colleagues for Matilda**:\n   - Use set operations to determine the unique female colleagues Matilda has, excluding herself.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the social circles using sets\nsarah_circle = {\"Sarah\", \"Male1\", \"Male2\", \"Male3\", \"Female1\"}\njohn_circle = {\"John\", \"Male4\", \"Male5\", \"Male6\", \"Female2\", \"Matilda\"}\n\n# Identify Matilda as the common colleague\ncommon_colleagues = sarah_circle.intersection(john_circle)\n\n# Since we know Matilda is the only common colleague, we can remove her from the set\ncommon_colleagues.discard(\"Matilda\")\n\n# Calculate the unique female colleagues Matilda has\n# Exclude Matilda herself from the count\nsarah_females = {\"Female1\"}\njohn_females = {\"Female2\", \"Matilda\"}\n\n# Use set union to find all unique female colleagues\nunique_female_colleagues = sarah_females.union(john_females) - {\"Matilda\"}\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{len(unique_female_colleagues)}>>>\")\n```\n\nIn this code, we use sets to represent the social circles and perform set operations to find the unique female colleagues Matilda has, excluding herself. This approach is more robust and demonstrates a more complex method of solving the problem."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the number of female colleagues Matilda has, but the code is quite straightforward and lacks complexity. To improve the code, consider implementing a more detailed analysis of the social circles using data structures like sets to handle the overlap and uniqueness of colleagues. This will not only make the code more robust but also demonstrate a more complex approach to solving the problem. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, possibly using symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques."
