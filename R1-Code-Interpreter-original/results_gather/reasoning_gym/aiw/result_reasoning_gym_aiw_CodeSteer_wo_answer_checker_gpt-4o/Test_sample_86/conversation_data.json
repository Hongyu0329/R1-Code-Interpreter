  "question": "Jennifer has 1 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. William has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around William are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around William do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of William and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Jennifer has 1 male colleague and 6 female colleagues. This means Jennifer's circle has 1 + 6 = 7 colleagues in total, including Jennifer herself.\n\n2. William has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. This means William's circle has 3 + 3 = 6 colleagues in total, including William himself.\n\n3. Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and William, meaning she is part of both circles.\n\n4. Since Matilda is part of both circles, she is counted in both Jennifer's and William's circles.\n\n5. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap and the unique members in each circle.\n\nLet's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Jennifer's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n- In William's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n- Matilda is counted in both circles, so we need to account for her being counted twice.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle\nfemale_colleagues_jennifer = 6\n\n# Number of female colleagues in William's circle\nfemale_colleagues_william = 3\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double counting\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_jennifer + female_colleagues_william - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total number of female colleagues Matilda has by adding the female colleagues from both circles and subtracting 1 to account for Matilda being counted twice."
