  "question": "Jennifer has 5 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. Joseph has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Jennifer has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. This means Jennifer's circle has 9 people in total (including Jennifer herself).\n\n2. Joseph has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues. This means Joseph's circle has 9 people in total (including Joseph himself).\n\n3. Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and Joseph, meaning she is part of both circles.\n\n4. Since Matilda is part of both circles, she is counted in both Jennifer's and Joseph's circles.\n\n5. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap and the unique members in each circle.\n\nPlan:\n- Calculate the total number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle.\n- Calculate the total number of female colleagues in Joseph's circle.\n- Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to subtract her from the total count of female colleagues in Joseph's circle to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle\nfemale_colleagues_jennifer = 3\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Joseph's circle\nfemale_colleagues_joseph = 4\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract her from Joseph's circle\n# to find the unique female colleagues Matilda has\nunique_female_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_joseph - 1\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{unique_female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```"
