    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the friends. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Mary has 2 male friends and 2 female friends.\n2. All of them are friends with each other.\n3. William is one of the male friends of Mary.\n\nSince all of them are friends with each other, William, being one of the male friends, will also be friends with the 2 female friends of Mary. Therefore, William has 2 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends William has\nfemale_friends_of_william = 2\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_william}>>>\")\n```"
