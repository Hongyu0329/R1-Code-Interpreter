    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Margaret's friends. Margaret has 1 male friend and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nSince William is the male friend of Margaret, he is friends with all of Margaret's friends, which includes the 6 female friends. Therefore, William has 6 female friends.\n\nLet's write a Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Margaret has\nfemale_friends_of_margaret = 6\n\n# Since William is friends with all of Margaret's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_william = female_friends_of_margaret\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_william}>>>\")\n```"
