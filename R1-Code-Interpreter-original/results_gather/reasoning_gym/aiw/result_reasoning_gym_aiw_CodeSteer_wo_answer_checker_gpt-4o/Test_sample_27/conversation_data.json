    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described:\n\n1. Alice has 2 sisters and 1 brother.\n2. We need to determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\nThe key here is to recognize that Joseph's brother is also Alice's brother. Since Alice has 2 sisters, Joseph's brother (who is Alice's brother) also has the same 2 sisters.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Alice has\nalice_sisters = 2\n\n# Joseph's brother is Alice's brother, so he has the same number of sisters\njoseph_brothers_sisters = alice_sisters\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{joseph_brothers_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
