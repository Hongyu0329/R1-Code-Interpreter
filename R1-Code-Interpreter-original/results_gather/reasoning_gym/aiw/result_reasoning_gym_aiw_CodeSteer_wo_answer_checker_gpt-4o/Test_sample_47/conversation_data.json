    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Barbara's brother has. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the family members:\n   - Barbara has 2 brothers.\n   - Barbara has 2 sisters.\n\n2. Determine the number of sisters Barbara's brother has:\n   - Since Barbara is a sister to her brothers, we need to include her in the count of sisters.\n   - Therefore, Barbara's brothers have 2 sisters (Barbara and her other sister).\n\n3. Output the result in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Barbara's brother has\nsisters_of_brother = 2\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_brother}>>>\")\n```"
