    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Jessica's friends. Jessica has 5 male friends and 5 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means each male friend is friends with all 5 female friends.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Jessica has 5 male friends.\n2. Jessica has 5 female friends.\n3. All of Jessica's friends are friends with each other.\n\nSince David is one of the male friends, he is friends with all of Jessica's female friends. Therefore, David has 5 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends David has\nfemale_friends_of_david = 5\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_david}>>>\")\n```"
