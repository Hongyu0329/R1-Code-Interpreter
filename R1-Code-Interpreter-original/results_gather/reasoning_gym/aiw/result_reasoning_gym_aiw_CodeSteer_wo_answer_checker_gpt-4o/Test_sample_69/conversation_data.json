    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Linda has 3 male friends and 4 female friends, and they all are friends with each other. This means each male friend, including Thomas, is friends with all of Linda's female friends.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of female friends Linda has.\n2. Since all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, Thomas, being one of the male friends, is friends with all of Linda's female friends.\n3. Therefore, the number of female friends Thomas has is equal to the number of Linda's female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Linda has\nfemale_friends_of_linda = 4\n\n# Since Thomas is friends with all of Linda's friends, he has the same number of female friends\nfemale_friends_of_thomas = female_friends_of_linda\n\n# Output the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_thomas}>>>\")\n```"
