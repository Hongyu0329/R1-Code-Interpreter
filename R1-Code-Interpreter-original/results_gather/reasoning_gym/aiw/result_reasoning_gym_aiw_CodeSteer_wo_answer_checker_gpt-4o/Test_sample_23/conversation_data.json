    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Linda's brother has. Since Linda has 3 sisters, each of her brothers also has the same number of sisters. Therefore, the answer is simply the number of sisters Linda has.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Identify the number of sisters Linda has.\n2. Output the number of sisters Linda's brother has in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Linda has\nnumber_of_sisters = 3\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{number_of_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
