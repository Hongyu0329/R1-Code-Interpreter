    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters each of Jessica's brothers has. \n\n1. Jessica has 2 sisters.\n2. Jessica herself is also a sister to her brothers.\n\nTherefore, each of Jessica's brothers has 3 sisters in total (Jessica + 2 sisters).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Jessica's brother has\nsisters = 2 + 1  # 2 sisters + Jessica herself\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters}>>>\")\n```"
