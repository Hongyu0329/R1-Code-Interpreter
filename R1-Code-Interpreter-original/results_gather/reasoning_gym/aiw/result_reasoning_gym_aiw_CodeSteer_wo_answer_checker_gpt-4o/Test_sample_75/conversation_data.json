  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described:\n\n1. Margaret has 4 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. Bob is one of Margaret's brothers.\n\nSince Bob is one of Margaret's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Margaret. Therefore, Bob's brother (which could be Bob himself or one of his other brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Margaret does.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Margaret has 4 sisters\nsisters_of_margaret = 4\n\n# Bob's brother has the same number of sisters as Margaret\nsisters_of_bobs_brother = sisters_of_margaret\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_bobs_brother}>>>\")\n```"
