    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Susan's brother has. Since Susan and her brothers share the same siblings, the number of sisters Susan's brother has is the same as the number of sisters Susan has. Therefore, the answer is simply the number of sisters Susan has, which is 5.\n\nHere's the Python code to output the answer in the specified format:\n\n```python\nsisters = 5\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters}>>>\")\n```"
