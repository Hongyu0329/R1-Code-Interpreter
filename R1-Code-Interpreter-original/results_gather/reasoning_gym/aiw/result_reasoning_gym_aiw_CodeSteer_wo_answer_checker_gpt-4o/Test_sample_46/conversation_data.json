  "question": "Patricia has 6 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Patricia has. All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. William has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around William are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around William do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of William and she is also colleague of Patricia, being part of Patricia's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Patricia has 6 male and 6 female colleagues. This means Patricia's circle has 13 people in total (including Patricia herself).\n\n2. William has 3 male and 6 female colleagues. This means William's circle has 10 people in total (including William himself).\n\n3. Matilda is a common colleague between Patricia and William, meaning she is part of both circles.\n\n4. We need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\nPlan:\n- Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n- Matilda's female colleagues are those in both Patricia's and William's circles, minus any double-counting of Matilda herself.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n\n- Patricia's circle has 6 female colleagues.\n- William's circle has 6 female colleagues.\n- Matilda is counted in both circles, so we need to subtract her once.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Patricia's circle\nfemale_colleagues_patricia = 6\n\n# Number of female colleagues in William's circle\nfemale_colleagues_william = 6\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so subtract her once\nmatilda_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_patricia + female_colleagues_william - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{matilda_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",
    "The task at hand is indeed a straightforward arithmetic problem, and the solution provided is based on logical reasoning about the overlap between Patricia's and William's circles of colleagues. Given the information provided, the solution calculates the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and subtracting the double-counting of Matilda herself.\n\nIf there are no additional constraints or requirements for symbolic computing, the current solution is appropriate for the problem. The task does not require complex algorithms or symbolic computation, as it involves simple arithmetic and logical deduction.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

    "The current solution seems to be correct as it logically deduces the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap between Patricia's and William's circles. However, the complexity analysis suggests that the code is not complex enough for symbolic computing. In this case, the task does not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms, as it is a straightforward arithmetic problem. Therefore, the current solution is sufficient. If you believe the task requires more complex reasoning or if there are additional constraints not considered, please provide further details. Otherwise, the current solution should be accepted."
