Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 7 colleagues (including Mary)\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague\n   - Total: 5 colleagues (including Thomas)\n\n3. **Matilda's Role:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Mary's and Thomas's circles.\n   - She is the only person who is a colleague of both Mary and Thomas.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Mary's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n- In Thomas's circle, there is 1 female colleague.\n\nSince Matilda is the only person common to both circles, she is counted as a female colleague in both circles. Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues in both circles, minus 1 (since Matilda is counted in both circles).\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Mary's circle\nfemale_colleagues_mary = 3\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Thomas's circle\nfemale_colleagues_thomas = 1\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_mary + female_colleagues_thomas - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_matilda}>>>\")\n```",
    "To enhance the solution and make it more robust for handling more complex scenarios, we can use sets to represent the circles of colleagues. This will allow us to perform set operations to easily determine the unique and overlapping colleagues. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Represent each circle as a set:**\n   - Mary's circle will include 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Thomas's circle will include 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n\n2. **Identify Matilda as the common colleague:**\n   - Matilda is the only person common to both circles.\n\n3. **Use set operations to find the number of unique female colleagues:**\n   - We can use the union of the female colleagues from both circles and then adjust for Matilda being counted in both.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the sets for female colleagues in each circle\nfemale_colleagues_mary = {\"F1\", \"F2\", \"F3\"}  # 3 female colleagues in Mary's circle\nfemale_colleagues_thomas = {\"F4\"}  # 1 female colleague in Thomas's circle\n\n# Matilda is common in both circles\nmatilda = {\"Matilda\"}\n\n# Calculate the total unique female colleagues Matilda has\n# Union of both sets minus Matilda\nunique_female_colleagues = (female_colleagues_mary | female_colleagues_thomas | matilda) - matilda\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{len(unique_female_colleagues)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses set operations to determine the unique female colleagues Matilda has, providing a more flexible and scalable solution."

    "The current solution correctly calculates the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap between Mary's and Thomas's circles. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code is relatively simple and does not involve symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the code, consider exploring more complex logic or data structures that could handle more intricate scenarios or larger datasets. For instance, you could use sets to represent the circles and perform set operations to determine the unique and overlapping colleagues. This approach would not only solve the current problem but also provide a more robust solution for similar tasks."
