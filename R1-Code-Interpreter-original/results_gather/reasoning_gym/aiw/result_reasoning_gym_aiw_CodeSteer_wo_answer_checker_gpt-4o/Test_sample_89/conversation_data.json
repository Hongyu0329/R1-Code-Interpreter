    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Margaret's brother has. Since Margaret has 2 sisters, and she is also a sister to her brothers, we need to include her in the count of sisters for her brothers.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Identify the number of sisters Margaret has, which is 2.\n2. Include Margaret herself in the count of sisters for her brothers.\n3. Calculate the total number of sisters Margaret's brother has by adding Margaret to the number of sisters.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Margaret has\nsisters = 2\n\n# Include Margaret herself\ntotal_sisters_for_brother = sisters + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters_for_brother}>>>\")\n```"
