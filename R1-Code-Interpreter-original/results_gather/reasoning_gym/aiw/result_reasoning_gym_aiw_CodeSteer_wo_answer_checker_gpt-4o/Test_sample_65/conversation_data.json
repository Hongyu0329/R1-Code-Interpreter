    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Barbara's brothers have. \n\n1. Barbara has 1 sister (herself).\n2. Barbara's brothers will have the same number of sisters as Barbara does, because they share the same siblings.\n\nTherefore, Barbara's brothers have 1 sister.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Barbara's brothers have\nsisters_of_brothers = 1\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_brothers}>>>\")\n```"
