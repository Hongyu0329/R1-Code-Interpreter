All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Patricia, being part of Patricia's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Patricia has 6 male and 6 female colleagues. This means Patricia's circle has 12 people, including herself.\n2. Charles has 6 male and 5 female colleagues. This means Charles's circle has 11 people, including himself.\n3. Matilda is a common colleague between Patricia and Charles.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to find out how many female colleagues she has. \n\n- In Patricia's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n- In Charles's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider her as part of the female count in both circles. However, since she is the only common person, we don't double count her.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the number of female colleagues in Charles's circle, which is 5.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Charles's circle\nfemale_colleagues_charles = 5\n\n# Output the answer\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_charles}>>>\")\n```"
