    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Sarah's friends. Sarah has 3 male friends and 3 female friends, and they are all friends with each other. This means each male friend is friends with all the female friends.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Sarah has 3 male friends: Michael, Male Friend 2, and Male Friend 3.\n2. Sarah has 3 female friends: Female Friend 1, Female Friend 2, and Female Friend 3.\n3. Since all of Sarah's friends are friends with each other, Michael, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 3 female friends.\n\nTherefore, Michael has 3 female friends.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female friends Michael has\nfemale_friends_of_michael = 3\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{female_friends_of_michael}>>>\")\n```"
