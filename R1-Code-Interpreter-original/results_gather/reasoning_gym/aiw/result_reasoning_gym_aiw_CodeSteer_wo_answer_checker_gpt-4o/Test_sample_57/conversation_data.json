    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Margaret's brother has. \n\n1. Margaret has 3 sisters.\n2. Since Margaret is one of the sisters, her brothers will also have the same number of sisters as Margaret does.\n\nTherefore, Margaret's brothers have 3 sisters.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Margaret has\nsisters_of_margaret = 3\n\n# Since Margaret's brothers have the same sisters as Margaret\nsisters_of_brother = sisters_of_margaret\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_brother}>>>\")\n```"
