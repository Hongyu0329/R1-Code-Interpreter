    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described. \n\n1. Susan has 2 sisters and 2 brothers. This means there are 5 siblings in total: Susan, her 2 sisters, and her 2 brothers.\n2. James is one of Susan's brothers. Therefore, James has the same siblings as Susan.\n3. Since Susan has 2 sisters, James also has 2 sisters.\n\nNow, let's write a Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Susan has\nsisters_of_susan = 2\n\n# Since James is Susan's brother, he has the same number of sisters\nsisters_of_james = sisters_of_susan\n\n# Output the answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_james}>>>\")\n```"
