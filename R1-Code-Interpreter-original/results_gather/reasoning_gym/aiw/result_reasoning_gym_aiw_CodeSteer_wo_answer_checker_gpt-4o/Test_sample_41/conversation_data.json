    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described. \n\n1. Sarah has 2 sisters and 5 brothers. This means Sarah is one of the sisters, so there are 3 sisters in total (Sarah + 2 sisters).\n2. Joseph's brother is one of Sarah's brothers. Since Sarah has 5 brothers, Joseph's brother is one of these 5.\n3. Therefore, Joseph's brother has the same number of sisters as Sarah does.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and output the number of sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Sarah has\nsarah_sisters = 2\n\n# Including Sarah herself, the total number of sisters\ntotal_sisters = sarah_sisters + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
