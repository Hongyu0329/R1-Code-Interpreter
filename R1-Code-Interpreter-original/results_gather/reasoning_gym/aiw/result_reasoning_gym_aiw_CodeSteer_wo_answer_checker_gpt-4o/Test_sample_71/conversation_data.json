Michael has 5 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Jessica's circle:\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague (Jessica herself)\n   - Total: 7 people\n\n2. Michael's circle:\n   - 5 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 11 people\n\n3. Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jessica and Michael.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has in Michael's circle. \n\n- In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n- Matilda is one of these female colleagues.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has in Michael's circle is 6 (including herself).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Michael's circle\nfemale_colleagues_michael_circle = 6\n\n# Output the answer\nprint(f\"<<<{female_colleagues_michael_circle}>>>\")\n```"
