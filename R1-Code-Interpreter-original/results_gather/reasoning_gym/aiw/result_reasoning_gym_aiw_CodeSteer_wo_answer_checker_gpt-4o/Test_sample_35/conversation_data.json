    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described:\n\n1. Susan has 3 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. Joseph is one of Susan's brothers.\n\nSince Joseph is one of Susan's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Susan. Therefore, Joseph's brother (which could be Joseph himself or one of his other brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Susan does.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate and print the number of sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Susan has\nsisters_of_susan = 3\n\n# Since Joseph is one of Susan's brothers, he has the same number of sisters\nsisters_of_josephs_brother = sisters_of_susan\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{sisters_of_josephs_brother}>>>\")\n```"
