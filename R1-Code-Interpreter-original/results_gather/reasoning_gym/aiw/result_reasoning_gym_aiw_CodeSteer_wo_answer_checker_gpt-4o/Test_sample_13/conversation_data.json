    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Jessica and William. The problem states that Jessica has 3 sisters and 1 brother. If William is Jessica's brother, then William would have the same number of sisters as Jessica does. Therefore, William's brother (which is William himself) would have the same number of sisters as Jessica.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of sisters Jessica has, which is 3.\n2. Since William is Jessica's brother, he would have the same number of sisters.\n3. Output the number of sisters William's brother has in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Jessica has\njessica_sisters = 3\n\n# Since William is Jessica's brother, he has the same number of sisters\nwilliams_sisters = jessica_sisters\n\n# Output the answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{williams_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
