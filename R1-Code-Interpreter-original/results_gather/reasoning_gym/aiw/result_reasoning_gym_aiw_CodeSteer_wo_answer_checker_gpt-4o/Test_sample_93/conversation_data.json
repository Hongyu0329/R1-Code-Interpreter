  "question": "Linda has 3 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Linda has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues. This means Linda's circle has 3 males + 5 females + Linda herself = 9 people.\n2. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues. This means Charles's circle has 6 males + 2 females + Charles himself = 9 people.\n3. Matilda is a unique case because she is a colleague of both Linda and Charles. Therefore, she is counted in both circles.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Linda's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n- In Charles's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n- Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\nThe task is to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has, considering she is part of both circles. Since Matilda is already counted as a female colleague in both circles, we need to subtract her from the total count of female colleagues in both circles.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle\nfemale_colleagues_linda = 5\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Charles's circle\nfemale_colleagues_charles = 2\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her\ntotal_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_linda + female_colleagues_charles - 1\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{total_female_colleagues}>>>\")\n```",

    "The current solution correctly calculates the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering her presence in both circles and avoiding double-counting. The code is simple and effective for this task, as it directly addresses the problem without unnecessary complexity. Therefore, the current answer is correct."
