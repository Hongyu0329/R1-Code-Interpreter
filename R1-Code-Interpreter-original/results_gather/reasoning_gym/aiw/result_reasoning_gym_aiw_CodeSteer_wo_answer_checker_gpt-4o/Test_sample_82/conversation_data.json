    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Patricia's brothers have. Since Patricia has 6 brothers and 2 sisters, we can assume that all siblings share the same parents. Therefore, Patricia's brothers have the same number of sisters as Patricia does.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the number of sisters Patricia has, which is given as 2.\n2. Since Patricia's brothers are part of the same family, they also have the same number of sisters.\n3. Output the number of sisters Patricia's brothers have in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters Patricia has\nnumber_of_sisters = 2\n\n# Output the number of sisters Patricia's brothers have\nprint(f\"<<<{number_of_sisters}>>>\")\n```"
