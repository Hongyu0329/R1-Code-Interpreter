James has 2 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Susan and James.\n\n1. **Susan's Circle:**\n   - Susan has 5 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Susan's circle = 5 males + 5 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 2 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in James's circle = 2 males + 6 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Susan and James.\n   - This means Matilda is part of both Susan's and James's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Susan's circle, she has 5 male and 5 female colleagues from Susan's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is part of James's circle, she has 2 male and 6 female colleagues from James's circle.\n\n5. **Overlap and Unique Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is counted in both circles, but we need to consider the unique set of colleagues she has.\n   - Since Matilda is the only person common between the two circles, the overlap is only Matilda herself.\n\n6. **Calculating Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - From Susan's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n   - From James's circle, Matilda has 6 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues are the union of the female colleagues from both circles.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues from both circles.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 5 (from Susan's circle) + 6 (from James's circle) = 11 female colleagues.\n\nHowever, since Matilda herself is counted in both circles, we need to subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her.\n\nThus, Matilda has 10 unique female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>10"
