    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Patricia and William.\n\n1. **Patricia's Circle:**\n   - Patricia has 6 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Patricia's circle = 6 males + 6 females = 12 colleagues.\n\n2. **William's Circle:**\n   - William has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in William's circle = 3 males + 6 females = 9 colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and William.\n   - This means Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Understanding the Overlap:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Patricia and William, she is the only overlap between the two circles.\n   - Therefore, the total number of unique individuals in both circles is the sum of the individuals in each circle minus Matilda (since she is counted twice, once in each circle).\n\n5. **Calculating Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In William's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of William's circle, she is included in these 6 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues in William's circle (excluding herself).\n\nThus, Matilda has 5 female colleagues in William's circle.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
