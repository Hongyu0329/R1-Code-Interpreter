    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Jessica and James, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Jessica's Circle:**\n   - Jessica has 5 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Jessica's circle = 5 males + 5 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in James's circle = 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jessica and James.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jessica's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - In James's circle, there is 1 female colleague.\n   - Since Matilda is the only common colleague, the female colleague in James's circle must be Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda's female colleagues are the 5 female colleagues from Jessica's circle, excluding herself.\n\nThus, Matilda has 4 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>4"
