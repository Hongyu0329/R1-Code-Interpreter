    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Patricia and Robert, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Patricia's Circle:**\n   - Patricia has 1 male colleague and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Patricia's circle = 1 male + 5 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n2. **Robert's Circle:**\n   - Robert has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Robert's circle = 3 males + 3 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and Robert.\n   - This means Matilda is counted in both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues she has.\n   - In Patricia's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues (including herself).\n   - In Robert's circle, Matilda has 3 female colleagues (including herself).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider the unique female colleagues she has.\n   - Matilda is a female, so she is included in the count of female colleagues in both circles.\n   - Therefore, the unique female colleagues Matilda has are the ones from Patricia's circle, excluding herself.\n\nThus, Matilda has 5 female colleagues in total.\n\n<<<answer>>>5"
