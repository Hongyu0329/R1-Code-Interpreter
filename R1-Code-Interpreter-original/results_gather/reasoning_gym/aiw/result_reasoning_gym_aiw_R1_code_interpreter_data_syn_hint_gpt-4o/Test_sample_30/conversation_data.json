All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. John has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Jennifer and John, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - 2 male colleagues\n   - 4 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 colleagues\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 9 colleagues\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and John.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has, considering her unique position.\n\n- **Jennifer's Circle (including Matilda):**\n  - Total: 6 colleagues (2 males + 4 females)\n  - Matilda is one of the 4 female colleagues.\n\n- **John's Circle (including Matilda):**\n  - Total: 9 colleagues (3 males + 6 females)\n  - Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to determine the number of unique female colleagues she has. \n\n- In Jennifer's circle, Matilda is one of the 4 female colleagues.\n- In John's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who overlaps between the two circles, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the unique female colleagues from both circles, minus Matilda herself.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- Jennifer's circle has 4 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n- John's circle has 6 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to subtract her once to avoid double-counting.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total female colleagues} = (4 - 1) + (6 - 1) = 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nThus, Matilda has 8 female colleagues.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
