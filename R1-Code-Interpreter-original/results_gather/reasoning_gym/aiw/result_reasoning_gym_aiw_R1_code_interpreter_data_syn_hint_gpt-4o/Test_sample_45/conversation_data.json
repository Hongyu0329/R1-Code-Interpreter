    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and connections between the colleagues of Barbara and Michael, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Barbara's Circle:**\n   - Barbara has 2 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Barbara's circle = 2 males + 2 females = 4 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Barbara's circle.\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - Michael has 1 male colleague and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Michael's circle = 1 male + 3 females = 4 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\n3. **Overlap and Unique Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Barbara and Michael.\n   - Since Matilda is in both circles, she is counted in both Barbara's and Michael's circles.\n\n4. **Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Barbara's circle, Matilda has 1 other female colleague (since there are 2 females including herself).\n   - In Michael's circle, Matilda has 2 other female colleagues (since there are 3 females including herself).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 1 female colleague from Barbara's circle and 2 female colleagues from Michael's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, the female colleagues from Michael's circle are distinct from those in Barbara's circle.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has a total of 1 (from Barbara's circle) + 2 (from Michael's circle) = 3 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>3"
