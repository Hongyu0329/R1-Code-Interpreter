    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Bob's brother has. \n\n1. **Understanding the Family Structure**: \n   - Patricia has 6 sisters and 4 brothers. \n   - This means Patricia is one of the sisters, so there are 7 sisters in total (Patricia + 6 other sisters).\n   - Bob is one of Patricia's brothers.\n\n2. **Analyzing Bob's Family**:\n   - Since Bob is one of Patricia's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Patricia.\n   - Therefore, Bob's brother (who is also one of Patricia's brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Patricia does.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Bob's brother has the same number of sisters as Patricia, which is 7.\n\nThus, the number of sisters Bob's brother has is 7.\n\n<<<answer>>>7"
