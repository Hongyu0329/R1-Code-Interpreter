    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Elizabeth's friends. Elizabeth has 4 male friends and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nSince Bob is one of Elizabeth's male friends, he is part of this group of 10 people (4 males + 6 females). Since all of them are friends with each other, Bob, being a male friend, is friends with all 6 of Elizabeth's female friends.\n\nTherefore, Bob has 6 female friends.\n\n<<<6>>>"
