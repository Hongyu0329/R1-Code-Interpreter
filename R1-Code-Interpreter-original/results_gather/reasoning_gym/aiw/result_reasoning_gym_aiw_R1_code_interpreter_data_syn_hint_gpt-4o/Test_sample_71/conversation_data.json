  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Jessica and Michael.\n\n1. **Jessica's Circle:**\n   - Jessica has 6 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Jessica's circle = 6 males + 1 female = 7 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the only female colleague in Jessica's circle.\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - Michael has 5 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Michael's circle = 5 males + 6 females = 11 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is part of Michael's circle and is also part of Jessica's circle.\n\n3. **Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is in both circles, but we need to determine her female colleagues.\n   - In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\nSince Matilda is the only female in Jessica's circle, the female colleagues she has are from Michael's circle.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\n<<<answer>>>5"
