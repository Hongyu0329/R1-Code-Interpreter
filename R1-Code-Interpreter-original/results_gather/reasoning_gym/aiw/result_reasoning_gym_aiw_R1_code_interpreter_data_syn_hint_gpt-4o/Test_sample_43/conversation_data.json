    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Susan's friends. Susan has 1 male friend and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends aside from this group.\n\nJoseph, the male friend of Susan, is part of this group. Since all of Susan's friends are friends with each other, Joseph is friends with all of Susan's female friends. Therefore, Joseph has 6 female friends.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward because the problem states that all of Susan's friends are friends with each other, meaning Joseph, being one of them, is friends with all the female friends.\n\n<<<answer>>>6"
