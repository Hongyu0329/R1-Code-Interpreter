    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described.\n\n1. Margaret has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This means there are 4 siblings in total: Margaret, her 2 sisters, and her 1 brother.\n\n2. The question asks about Charles's brother. Since Margaret's brother is Charles, we need to determine how many sisters Charles has.\n\n3. Since Charles is Margaret's brother, he shares the same siblings as Margaret. Therefore, Charles has the same number of sisters as Margaret.\n\n4.
