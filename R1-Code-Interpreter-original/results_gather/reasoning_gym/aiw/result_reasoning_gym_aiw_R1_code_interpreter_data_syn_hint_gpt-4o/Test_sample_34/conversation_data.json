    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described:\n\n1. Susan has 3 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. We need to determine how many sisters Michael's brother has.\n\nSince Susan has 4 brothers, one of them could be Michael. If Michael is one of Susan's brothers, then Michael's brother (which could be any of Susan's brothers, including Michael himself) would have the same number of sisters as Susan does.\n\nTherefore, Michael's brother would have the same number of sisters as Susan, which is 3.\n\n<<<'3'>>>"
