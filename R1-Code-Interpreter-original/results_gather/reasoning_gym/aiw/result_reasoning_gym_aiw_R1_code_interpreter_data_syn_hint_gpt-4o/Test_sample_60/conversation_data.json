    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Margaret's friends. Margaret has 5 male friends and 5 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends aside from this group.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Margaret has 5 male friends: Let's call them M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5.\n2. Margaret has 5 female friends: Let's call them F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5.\n\nSince all of these friends are friends with each other, each male friend is friends with all 5 female friends. Therefore, Thomas, who is one of the male friends (let's say M1), is friends with all 5 female friends: F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5.\n\nThus, Thomas has 5 female friends.\n\n<<<answer>>>5"
