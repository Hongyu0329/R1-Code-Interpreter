    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and connections between Jessica's and Charles's circles of colleagues.\n\n1. **Jessica's Circle:**\n   - Jessica has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Jessica's circle = 6 males + 3 females = 9 colleagues.\n\n2. **Charles's Circle:**\n   - Charles has 1 male colleague and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Charles's circle = 1 male + 1 female = 2 colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Connection:**\n   - Matilda is a unique connection between Jessica's and Charles's circles.\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Jessica and Charles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jessica's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Jessica's circle, she is one of these 3 female colleagues.\n   - In Charles's circle, there is 1 female colleague, which is Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 2 female colleagues in Jessica's circle (excluding herself) and no additional female colleagues in Charles's circle (since she is the only female there).\n\nThus, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is 2.\n\n<<<answer>>>2"
