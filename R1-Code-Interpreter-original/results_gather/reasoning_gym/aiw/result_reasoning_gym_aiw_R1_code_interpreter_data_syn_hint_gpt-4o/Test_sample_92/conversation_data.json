James has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Sarah and James, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 2 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 2 males + 1 female = 3 colleagues.\n   - Including Sarah herself, the total number of people in Sarah's circle = 3 colleagues + Sarah = 4 people.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in James's circle = 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues.\n   - Including James himself, the total number of people in James's circle = 7 colleagues + James = 8 people.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and James.\n   - Matilda is part of both Sarah's and James's circles.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Sarah's circle, there is 1 female colleague (excluding Sarah herself).\n   - In James's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n   - Matilda is counted as a female colleague in both circles, but we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 1 female colleague from Sarah's circle.\n   - Matilda has 3 female colleagues from James's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to subtract her from the total count of female colleagues.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 3 (from James's circle) + 1 (from Sarah's circle) - 1 (Matilda herself) = 3.\n\n<<<answer>>>3"
