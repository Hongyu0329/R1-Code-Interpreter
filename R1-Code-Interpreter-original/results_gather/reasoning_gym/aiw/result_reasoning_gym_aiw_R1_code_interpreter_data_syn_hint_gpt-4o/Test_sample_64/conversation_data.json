Alice's friends have no other friends aside from each other.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Alice's friends are: Richard (male), another male friend, and one female friend.\n- Since all of Alice's friends are friends with each other, Richard is friends with the other male friend and the female friend.\n- The problem states that Alice's friends have no other friends aside from each other.\n\nTherefore, Richard, being one of Alice's male friends, has exactly one female friend, who is the female friend of Alice.\n\nThus, the number of female friends Richard has is 1.\n\n<<<answer>>>1"
