    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Jessica's friends. Jessica has 5 male friends and 5 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends aside from this group.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Jessica has 5 male friends: Let's call them M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5.\n2. Jessica has 5 female friends: Let's call them F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5.\n\nSince all of these friends are friends with each other, each male friend is friends with all 5 female friends. \n\nNow, let's focus on David, who is one of the male friends (let's assume David is M1). Since David is friends with all of Jessica's female friends, he has 5 female friends.\n\nTherefore, David has 5 female friends.\n\n<<<answer>>>5"
