    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships and the information given:\n\n1. Susan has 3 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. We need to determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\nSince Susan and Joseph are not explicitly stated to be related, we need to consider the possibility that they might be siblings. If Joseph is one of Susan's brothers, then Joseph's brother would be one of Susan's brothers as well.\n\nGiven that Susan has 3 sisters, if Joseph is indeed one of Susan's brothers, then Joseph's brother would also have the same number of sisters as Susan, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, Joseph's brother has 3 sisters.\n\n<<<answer>>>3<<<answer>>>"
