  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Jessica and William. The problem states that Jessica has 3 sisters and 1 brother. \n\nThe key point here is to determine if William is the brother of Jessica. If William is Jessica's brother, then William's brother (which is William himself) would have the same number of sisters as Jessica does. \n\nSince the problem does not provide any additional information about William's family, we can reasonably assume that William is indeed Jessica's brother. Therefore, William's brother (William) would have the same number of sisters as Jessica.\n\nJessica has 3 sisters, so William's brother also has 3 sisters.\n\n<<<3>>>"
