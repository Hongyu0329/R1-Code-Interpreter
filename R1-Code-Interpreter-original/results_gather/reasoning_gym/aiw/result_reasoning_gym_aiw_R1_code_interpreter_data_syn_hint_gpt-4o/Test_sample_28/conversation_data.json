    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described.\n\n1. Margaret has 2 sisters and 3 brothers. This means there are a total of 6 siblings in Margaret's family (including Margaret herself).\n\n2. Since Margaret is one of the sisters, the other two sisters are her siblings. Therefore, Margaret's brothers also have the same number of sisters as Margaret does.\n\n3. Robert is one of Margaret's brothers. Therefore, Robert's brother (which could be Robert himself or one of his other brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Margaret.\n\nThus, Robert's brother has 2 sisters.\n\n<<<answer>>>2"
