    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Sarah and Thomas, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 1 male colleague and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 1 male + 2 females = 3 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and Thomas.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Sarah's circle, she has 4 female colleagues from Sarah's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Thomas's circle, she has 2 female colleagues from Thomas's circle.\n\n5. **Unique Female Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Sarah's circle are already counted.\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Thomas's circle include herself and one other female (since she is part of the 2 females in Thomas's circle).\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 4 female colleagues from Sarah's circle, and she is one of the 2 females in Thomas's circle, meaning she has 1 additional female colleague from Thomas's circle.\n\nThus, Matilda has a total of 4 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>4"
