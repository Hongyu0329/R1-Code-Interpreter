  "question": "Linda has 4 male colleagues and she also has 2 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. David has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around David are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around David do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of David and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Linda and David, considering the overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 4 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 4 males + 2 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n2. **David's Circle:**\n   - David has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in David's circle = 4 males + 4 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and David.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Linda's circle, she has 4 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues from Linda's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is part of David's circle, she has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues from David's circle.\n\n5. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Linda's circle = 2.\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from David's circle = 4.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n   - However, the problem states that Matilda is the only overlap, so the female colleagues from David's circle are distinct from those in Linda's circle, except for Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 2 female colleagues from Linda's circle and 3 additional female colleagues from David's circle (excluding herself).\n\nThus, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is 2 (from Linda's circle) + 3 (from David's circle, excluding Matilda herself) = 5.\n\n<<<answer>>>5"
