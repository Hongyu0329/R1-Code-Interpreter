    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Linda and John, and how they intersect through Matilda.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 5 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 5 males + 1 female = 6 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the only female colleague in Linda's circle.\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - John has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 3 males + 5 females = 8 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is part of John's circle and is one of the 5 female colleagues.\n\n3. **Intersection through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Linda and John.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both circles.\n\n4. **Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In John's circle, there are 5 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues in John's circle.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 4.\n\n<<<answer>>>4"
