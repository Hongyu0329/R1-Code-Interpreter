  "question": "Sarah has 4 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Sarah and James, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 4 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 4 males + 6 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in James's circle = 5 males + 3 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Sarah and James.\n   - This means Matilda is counted in both Sarah's and James's circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has.\n   - In Sarah's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n   - In James's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, she is counted once in each circle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues are the union of the female colleagues from both circles.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 6 female colleagues from Sarah's circle and 3 from James's circle, but since she is counted in both, we need to subtract her once.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 6 (from Sarah's circle) + 3 (from James's circle) - 1 (Matilda herself) = 8.\n\n<<<answer>>>8"
