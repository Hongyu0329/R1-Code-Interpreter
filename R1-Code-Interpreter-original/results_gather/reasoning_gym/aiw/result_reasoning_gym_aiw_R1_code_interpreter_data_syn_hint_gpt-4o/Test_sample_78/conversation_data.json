    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Susan and Charles, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Susan's Circle:**\n   - Susan has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Susan's circle = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n2. **Charles's Circle:**\n   - Charles has 4 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Charles's circle = 4 males + 6 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Susan and Charles.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Susan's circle, she has 2 male and 4 female colleagues from Susan's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Charles's circle, she has 4 male and 6 female colleagues from Charles's circle.\n   - However, Matilda herself is counted in both circles, so we need to adjust for this overlap.\n\n5. **Calculating Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Susan's circle = 4 (excluding Matilda herself).\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Charles's circle = 6 (excluding Matilda herself).\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda's total female colleagues = 4 (from Susan's circle) + 6 (from Charles's circle) - 1 (Matilda herself) = 9.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 9 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>9"
