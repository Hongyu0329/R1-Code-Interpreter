  "question": "Mary has 1 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Mary has. All these mentioned persons around Mary are colleagues of each other. Joseph has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. \n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 5 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 colleagues (including Mary)\n\n2. **Joseph's Circle:**\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 9 colleagues (including Joseph)\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Mary's and Joseph's circles.\n   - She is the only person who is a colleague of both Mary and Joseph.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Mary's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n- In Joseph's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider her unique position:\n\n- Matilda is one of the female colleagues in both circles.\n- Therefore, in Mary's circle, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues (5 total minus herself).\n- In Joseph's circle, Matilda has 2 other female colleagues (3 total minus herself).\n\nSince Matilda is the only overlap between the two circles, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the unique female colleagues from both circles:\n\n- 4 female colleagues from Mary's circle\n- 2 female colleagues from Joseph's circle\n\nThus, Matilda has a total of 4 + 2 = 6 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>6"
