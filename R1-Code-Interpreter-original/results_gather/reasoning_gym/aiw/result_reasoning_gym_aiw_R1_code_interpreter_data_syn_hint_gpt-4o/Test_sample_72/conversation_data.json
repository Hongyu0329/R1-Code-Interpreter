  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Linda and Michael, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues.\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - Michael has 1 male colleague and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Michael's circle = 1 male + 6 females = 7 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and Michael.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both Linda's and Michael's circles.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has.\n   - In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Michael's circle, she is one of these 6 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\nThus, Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>5"
