  "question": "Linda has 3 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Linda and Charles, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 3 males + 5 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n2. **Charles's Circle:**\n   - Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Charles's circle = 6 males + 2 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and Charles.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both Linda's and Charles's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Linda's circle, there are 5 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n   - In Charles's circle, there are 2 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues Matilda has. \n\n- From Linda's circle, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues (5 total females - 1 Matilda).\n- From Charles's circle, Matilda has 1 other female colleague (2 total females - 1 Matilda).\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who overlaps between the two circles, the female colleagues from Linda's circle and Charles's circle are distinct, except for Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues from both circles, excluding Matilda herself:\n\n- Total unique female colleagues = 4 (from Linda's circle) + 1 (from Charles's circle) = 5.\n\nThus, Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n\n<<<5>>>"
