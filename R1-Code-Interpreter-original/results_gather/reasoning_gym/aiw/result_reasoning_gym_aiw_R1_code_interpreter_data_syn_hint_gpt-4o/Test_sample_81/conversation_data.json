  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Elizabeth and James. The problem states that Elizabeth has 5 sisters and 4 brothers. It does not explicitly mention James, but we can infer that James is one of Elizabeth's brothers.\n\nSince Elizabeth has 5 sisters, and James is one of her brothers, James's sisters are the same as Elizabeth's sisters. Therefore, James also has 5 sisters.\n\nThus, the number of sisters James's brother (which could be James himself or one of his other brothers) has is the same as the number of sisters Elizabeth has.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<'5'>>>"
