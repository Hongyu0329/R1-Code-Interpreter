  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Jennifer and Thomas, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Jennifer's circle = 6 males + 5 females = 11 colleagues.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jennifer and Thomas.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is included in both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jennifer's circle, there are 5 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n   - In Thomas's circle, there is 1 female colleague, which is Matilda herself.\n\nSince Matilda is the only female in Thomas's circle, the female colleagues she has are those in Jennifer's circle, excluding herself.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle minus Matilda herself.\n\nThus, Matilda has 5 - 1 = 4 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>4"
