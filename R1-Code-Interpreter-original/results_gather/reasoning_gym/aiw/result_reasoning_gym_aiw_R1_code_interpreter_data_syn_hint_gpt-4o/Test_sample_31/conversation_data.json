    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Elizabeth's friends. Elizabeth has 4 male friends and 6 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nSince William is one of the 4 male friends, he is friends with all the other friends of Elizabeth. This includes the 6 female friends and the 3 other male friends (since he is one of the 4 male friends).\n\nTherefore, William, being a male friend of Elizabeth, has 6 female friends.\n\n<<<'6'>>>"
