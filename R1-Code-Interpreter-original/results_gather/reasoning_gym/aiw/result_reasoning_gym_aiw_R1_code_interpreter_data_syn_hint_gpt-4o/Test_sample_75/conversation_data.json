    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships described:\n\n1. Margaret has 4 sisters and 4 brothers.\n2. Bob is one of Margaret's brothers.\n\nWe need to determine how many sisters Bob's brother has. Since Bob is one of Margaret's brothers, we can assume that Bob's brother is also one of Margaret's brothers. Therefore, Bob's brother is also Margaret's brother.\n\nSince Margaret has 4 sisters, Bob's brother (who is also Margaret's brother) would have the same number of sisters as Margaret does.\n\nThus, Bob's brother has 4 sisters.\n\n<<<4>>>"
