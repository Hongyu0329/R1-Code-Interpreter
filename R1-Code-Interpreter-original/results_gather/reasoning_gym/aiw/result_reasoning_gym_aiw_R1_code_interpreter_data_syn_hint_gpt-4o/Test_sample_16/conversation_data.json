    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Jennifer's friends. Jennifer has 6 male friends and 5 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nSince Thomas is one of the 6 male friends, he is friends with all of Jennifer's friends. This includes all 5 of Jennifer's female friends. Therefore, Thomas has 5 female friends.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward because the problem states that all of Jennifer's friends are friends with each other, meaning each male friend is friends with all the female friends.\n\n<<<5>>>"
