    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and connections between Sarah's and John's circles of colleagues.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 5 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 5 males + 5 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - John has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and John.\n   - This means Matilda is part of both Sarah's and John's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Sarah's circle, she has 5 male and 5 female colleagues there.\n   - In John's circle, Matilda is one of the 4 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n\n5. **Overlap and Unique Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles.\n   - Therefore, the female colleagues Matilda has are the ones in Sarah's circle, excluding herself.\n\nThus, Matilda has 5 female colleagues in Sarah's circle.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<'5'>>>"
