  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Linda and Richard, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 5 males + 3 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n2. **Richard's Circle:**\n   - Richard has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Richard's circle = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and Richard.\n   - This means Matilda is counted in both Linda's and Richard's circles.\n\n4. **Understanding Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has.\n   - In Richard's circle, there are 4 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Richard's circle, she is one of these 4 female colleagues.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 3 other female colleagues in Richard's circle (excluding herself).\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 3.\n\n<<<answer>>>3"
