    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Margaret and Thomas.\n\n1. **Margaret's Circle:**\n   - Margaret has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Margaret's circle = 6 males + 3 females = 9 colleagues.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 1 male colleague and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 1 male + 6 females = 7 colleagues.\n\n3. **Common Colleague:**\n   - Matilda is the only common colleague between Margaret's and Thomas's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Margaret's circle, Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues.\n   - In Thomas's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues she has. \n\n- In Margaret's circle, Matilda has 2 other female colleagues (since she is one of the 3).\n- In Thomas's circle, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues (since she is one of the 6).\n\nSince Matilda is the only common colleague, the female colleagues in Thomas's circle are not part of Margaret's circle, except for Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues from both circles, excluding Matilda herself:\n\n- Female colleagues in Margaret's circle (excluding Matilda): 2\n- Female colleagues in Thomas's circle (excluding Matilda): 5\n\nTotal unique female colleagues Matilda has = 2 (from Margaret's circle) + 5 (from Thomas's circle) = 7.\n\nThus, Matilda has 7 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>7"
