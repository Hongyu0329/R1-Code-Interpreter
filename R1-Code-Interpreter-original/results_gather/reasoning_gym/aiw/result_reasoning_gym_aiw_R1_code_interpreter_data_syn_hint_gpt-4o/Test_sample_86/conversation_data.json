All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. William has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around William are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around William do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of William and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Jennifer and William, and how they intersect through Matilda.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - Jennifer has 1 male colleague and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Jennifer's circle = 1 male + 6 female = 7 colleagues.\n\n2. **William's Circle:**\n   - William has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in William's circle = 3 male + 3 female = 6 colleagues.\n\n3. **Intersection through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and William.\n   - This means Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Jennifer's circle, she has 1 male and 6 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is part of William's circle, she has 3 male and 3 female colleagues from William's circle.\n\n5. **Overlap Consideration:**\n   - Matilda herself is counted in both circles, but we need to consider the overlap.\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles, so the overlap is only Matilda herself.\n\n6. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - From Jennifer's circle, Matilda has 6 female colleagues.\n   - From William's circle, Matilda has 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, we do not double-count her.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 6 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle and 3 female colleagues from William's circle, but since Matilda is counted in both, we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n\nThus, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is 6 (from Jennifer's circle) + 3 (from William's circle) - 1 (Matilda herself) = 8.\n\nHowever, since Matilda is not counted as her own colleague, we simply add the female colleagues from both circles without subtracting Matilda:\n\n- Total female colleagues = 6 (from Jennifer's circle) + 3 (from William's circle) = 9.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 9 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>9"
