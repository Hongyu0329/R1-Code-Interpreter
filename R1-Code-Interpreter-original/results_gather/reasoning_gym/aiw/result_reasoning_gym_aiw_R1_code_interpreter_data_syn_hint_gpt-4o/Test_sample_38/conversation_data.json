She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Elizabeth, being part of Elizabeth's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Elizabeth and Joseph, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Elizabeth's Circle:**\n   - Elizabeth has 4 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Elizabeth's circle = 4 males + 2 females = 6 colleagues.\n   - Including Elizabeth herself, the total number of people in her circle is 7.\n\n2. **Joseph's Circle:**\n   - Joseph has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Joseph's circle = 3 males + 1 female = 4 colleagues.\n   - Including Joseph himself, the total number of people in his circle is 5.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Elizabeth and Joseph.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Elizabeth's circle, there are 2 female colleagues (excluding Elizabeth herself).\n   - In Joseph's circle, there is 1 female colleague.\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine if the female colleague in Joseph's circle is the same as one of the female colleagues in Elizabeth's circle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only person who overlaps between the two circles, the female colleague in Joseph's circle must be Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda's female colleagues are the 2 female colleagues from Elizabeth's circle.\n\nThus, Matilda has 2 female colleagues.\n\n<<<2>>>"
