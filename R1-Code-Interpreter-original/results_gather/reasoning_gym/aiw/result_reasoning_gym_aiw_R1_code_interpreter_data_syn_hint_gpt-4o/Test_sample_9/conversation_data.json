    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between Linda's friends. Linda has 4 male friends and 5 female friends. All of these friends are friends with each other, and they have no other friends outside this group.\n\nSince Robert is one of Linda's male friends, he is friends with all of Linda's female friends. Therefore, Robert has 5 female friends.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward because the problem states that all of Linda's friends are friends with each other, meaning each male friend is friends with all the female friends.\n\n<<<5>>>"
