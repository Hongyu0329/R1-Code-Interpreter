All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Patricia, being part of Patricia's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationships and the number of colleagues in the circles around Patricia and Charles.\n\n1. **Patricia's Circle:**\n   - Patricia has 6 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Patricia's circle = 6 males + 6 females = 12 colleagues.\n\n2. **Charles's Circle:**\n   - Charles has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Charles's circle = 6 males + 5 females = 11 colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and Charles.\n   - She is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Patricia's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n   - In Charles's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to determine how many of these female colleagues overlap.\n\n5. **Overlap and Unique Count:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles.\n   - Therefore, the overlap of female colleagues between Patricia's and Charles's circles is Matilda herself.\n\n6. **Calculating Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues are the unique female colleagues in both circles.\n   - From Patricia's circle, excluding Matilda, there are 5 other female colleagues.\n   - From Charles's circle, excluding Matilda, there are 4 other female colleagues.\n   - Total unique female colleagues for Matilda = 5 (from Patricia's circle) + 4 (from Charles's circle) = 9 female colleagues.\n\nThus, Matilda has 9 female colleagues.\n\n<<<9>>>"
