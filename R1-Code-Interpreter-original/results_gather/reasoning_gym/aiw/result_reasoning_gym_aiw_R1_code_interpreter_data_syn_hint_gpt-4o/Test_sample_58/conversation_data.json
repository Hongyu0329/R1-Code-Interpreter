    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Patricia and Joseph. The problem states that Patricia has 5 sisters and 6 brothers. It also asks how many sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Patricia has 5 sisters. This means there are 6 girls in total (Patricia + 5 sisters).\n2. Patricia has 6 brothers.\n3. Joseph is one of Patricia's brothers.\n\nSince Joseph is one of Patricia's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Patricia. Therefore, Joseph's brother (which could be any of the brothers, including Joseph himself) would have the same number of sisters as Patricia does.\n\nThus, Joseph's brother has 5 sisters.\n\n<<<answer>>>5<<<answer>>>"
