    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Sarah and John, and how they overlap through Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 3 males + 1 female = 4 colleagues.\n   - Including Sarah herself, the total number of people in Sarah's circle is 5.\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - John has 3 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 3 males + 2 females = 5 colleagues.\n   - Including John himself, the total number of people in John's circle is 6.\n\n3. **Overlap through Matilda:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and John.\n   - Matilda is part of Sarah's circle and also part of John's circle.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Sarah's circle, there is 1 female colleague (excluding Matilda).\n   - In John's circle, there are 2 female colleagues (including Matilda).\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues she has.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda is the only female in Sarah's circle, so she has no other female colleagues there.\n   - In John's circle, there is 1 other female colleague besides Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 1 female colleague.\n\n<<<answer>>>1"
