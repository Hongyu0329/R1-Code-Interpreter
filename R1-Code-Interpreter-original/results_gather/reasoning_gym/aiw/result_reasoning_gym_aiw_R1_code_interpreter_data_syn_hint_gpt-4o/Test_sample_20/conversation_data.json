    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the social circles of Mary and Thomas and determine how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - Mary has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Mary's circle = 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues.\n   - Including Mary, the total number of people in Mary's circle is 8.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues.\n   - Including Thomas, the total number of people in Thomas's circle is 6.\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Mary and Thomas.\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Mary's circle, there are 3 female colleagues (excluding Mary herself).\n   - In Thomas's circle, there is 1 female colleague.\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine if the female colleague in Thomas's circle is also in Mary's circle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Mary and Thomas, the female colleague in Thomas's circle must be Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda's female colleagues are the 3 female colleagues from Mary's circle.\n\nThus, Matilda has 3 female colleagues.\n\n<<<answer>>>3"
