    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has, considering both Sarah's and Thomas's circles.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - 2 male colleagues\n   - 4 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 colleagues (including Sarah)\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 2 female colleagues\n   - Total: 4 colleagues (including Thomas)\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Sarah's and Thomas's circles.\n\nSince Matilda is part of Sarah's circle, she is one of the 4 female colleagues in Sarah's circle. Therefore, the other 3 female colleagues in Sarah's circle are also Matilda's colleagues.\n\nIn Thomas's circle, Matilda is one of the 2 female colleagues. Therefore, the other female colleague in Thomas's circle is also Matilda's colleague.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- 3 female colleagues from Sarah's circle (excluding herself)\n- 1 female colleague from Thomas's circle (excluding herself)\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of female colleagues Matilda has.\n\nLet's calculate this: \n\n3 (from Sarah's circle) + 1 (from Thomas's circle) = 4\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
