    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Bob's brother has. \n\nSince Jennifer has 2 sisters and 6 brothers, it means there are 9 siblings in total (including Jennifer). Among these siblings, there are 3 girls (Jennifer and her 2 sisters) and 6 boys (her brothers).\n\nBob is one of Jennifer's brothers. Therefore, Bob's brother is also one of Jennifer's brothers. Since Jennifer has 2 sisters, Bob's brother also has 2 sisters.\n\nThus, the number of sisters Bob's brother has is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"
