  "question": "Linda has 5 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Richard has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Richard are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Richard do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Richard and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to consider the circles of colleagues around Linda and Richard, and the fact that Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - 5 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 5 males + 3 females = 8 colleagues\n\n2. **Richard's Circle:**\n   - 2 male colleagues\n   - 4 female colleagues\n   - Total: 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Linda's and Richard's circles.\n   - Since Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and Richard, she is counted in both circles.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Linda's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n- In Richard's circle, there are 4 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap. Matilda herself is one of the female colleagues in both circles. Therefore, we need to adjust for this overlap.\n\nLet's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has, excluding herself.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle\nfemale_colleagues_linda = 3\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Richard's circle\nfemale_colleagues_richard = 4\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her\nfemale_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_linda + female_colleagues_richard - 1\n\nfemale_colleagues_matilda\nassistant > Matilda has <<<6>>> female colleagues."
