All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n1. **Patricia's Circle:**\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 12 colleagues\n\n2. **Charles's Circle:**\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 5 female colleagues\n   - Total: 11 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and Charles.\n   - She is part of both circles.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap:\n\n- Matilda is one of the 5 female colleagues in Charles's circle.\n- Matilda is also one of the 6 female colleagues in Patricia's circle.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Patricia's circle, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues (since she is one of the 6).\n- In Charles's circle, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues (since she is one of the 5).\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who overlaps between the two circles, the female colleagues in Patricia's circle and Charles's circle are distinct except for Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the distinct female colleagues in both circles:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total female colleagues of Matilda} = (6 - 1) + (5 - 1) = 5 + 4 = 9 \\]\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<9>>>}\n\\]"
