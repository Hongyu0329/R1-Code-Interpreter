    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sisters Robert's brother has. \n\nSince Jessica has 4 sisters and 6 brothers, this means there are a total of 11 children in the family (including Jessica). \n\nRobert is one of Jessica's brothers. Therefore, Robert's brother would be one of the 6 brothers. \n\nSince all the siblings share the same family, Robert's brother would have the same number of sisters as Jessica, which is 4.\n\nThus, the number of sisters Robert's brother has is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"
