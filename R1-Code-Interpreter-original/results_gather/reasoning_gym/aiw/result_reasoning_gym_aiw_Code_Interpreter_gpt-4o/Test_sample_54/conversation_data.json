    "\nassistant > To determine how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to consider the circles of colleagues around Mary and Thomas, and the fact that Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 3 males + 6 females = 9 colleagues\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 1 female colleague\n   - Total: 1 male + 1 female = 2 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n   - In Thomas's circle, Matilda is the only female colleague.\n   - In Mary's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues she has. \n\n- In Mary's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n- In Thomas's circle, Matilda is the only female colleague.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, the unique female colleagues Matilda has are the 5 other female colleagues from Mary's circle (excluding herself).\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
