  "question": "Patricia has 1 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Patricia has. All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. Robert has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Robert are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Robert do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Robert and she is also colleague of Patricia, being part of Patricia's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has, given the information about Patricia's and Robert's circles of colleagues.\n\n1. **Patricia's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 5 female colleagues\n   - Total: 1 male + 5 female = 6 colleagues\n\n2. **Robert's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 3 male + 3 female = 6 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and Robert.\n   - Therefore, she is part of both circles.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap:\n\n- Matilda is one of the 5 female colleagues in Patricia's circle.\n- Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues in Robert's circle.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Patricia's circle, excluding Matilda, there are 4 other female colleagues.\n- In Robert's circle, excluding Matilda, there are 2 other female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the union of the female colleagues from both circles.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Patricia's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_patricia = 5 - 1\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Robert's circle (excluding Matilda)\nfemale_colleagues_robert = 3 - 1\n\n# Total unique female colleagues Matilda has\ntotal_female_colleagues_matilda = female_colleagues_patricia + female_colleagues_robert\ntotal_female_colleagues_matilda\nassistant > Matilda has <<<6>>> female colleagues."
