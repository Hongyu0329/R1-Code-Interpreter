    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has, given the information about Jessica's and Michael's circles of colleagues.\n\n1. **Jessica's Circle:**\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague (excluding Matilda)\n   - Total: 6 males + 1 female + Matilda = 8 colleagues\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - 5 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n   - Total: 5 males + 6 females = 11 colleagues\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jessica and Michael, she is counted in both circles.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n- Therefore, Matilda has 6 - 1 = 5 female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
