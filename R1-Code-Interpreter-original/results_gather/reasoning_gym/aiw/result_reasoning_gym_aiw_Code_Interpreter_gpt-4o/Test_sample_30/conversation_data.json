  "question": "Jennifer has 2 male colleagues and she also has 4 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. John has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to consider the circles of colleagues around Jennifer and John, and the fact that Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - 2 male colleagues\n   - 4 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 colleagues\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 9 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Jennifer's and John's circles.\n\nSince Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and John, she is counted in both circles. We need to determine how many unique female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n- In Jennifer's circle, there are 4 female colleagues.\n- In John's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles, we need to consider the overlap:\n\n- Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues in John's circle.\n- Therefore, the remaining 5 female colleagues in John's circle are not part of Jennifer's circle.\n\nThus, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the female colleagues in Jennifer's circle and the additional female colleagues in John's circle (excluding Matilda herself):\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Female Colleagues} = 4 + (6 - 1) = 4 + 5 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 9 female colleagues.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<9>>>"
