    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has, given the information about the circles of colleagues around Sarah and James.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - 2 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague (Matilda)\n   - Total: 3 colleagues (including Matilda)\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n   - Total: 7 colleagues (including Matilda)\n\nSince Matilda is part of both Sarah's and James's circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has in total.\n\n- In Sarah's circle, Matilda is the only female, so she has no female colleagues there.\n- In James's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda herself. Therefore, Matilda has 2 other female colleagues in James's circle.\n\nThus, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
