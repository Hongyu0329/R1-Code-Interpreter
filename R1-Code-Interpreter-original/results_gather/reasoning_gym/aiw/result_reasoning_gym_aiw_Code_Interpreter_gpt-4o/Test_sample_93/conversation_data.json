  "question": "Linda has 3 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to analyze the circles of colleagues around Linda and Charles.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 5 female colleagues\n   - Total: 3 males + 5 females = 8 colleagues\n\n2. **Charles's Circle:**\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 2 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 males + 2 females = 8 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and Charles.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is part of both circles.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine the overlap and how many female colleagues she has.\n\n- In Linda's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n- In Charles's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, she is counted in both. However, we need to find out how many unique female colleagues she has.\n\nLet's calculate the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap. Since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles, we can assume that the female colleagues in Charles's circle are also part of Linda's circle, except for Matilda herself.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the total number of female colleagues in Linda's circle, which is 5.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
