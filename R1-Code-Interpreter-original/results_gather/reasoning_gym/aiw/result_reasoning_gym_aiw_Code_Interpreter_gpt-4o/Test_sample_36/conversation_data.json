  "question": "Sarah has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. John has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has, considering both Sarah's and John's circles.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 5 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 5 males + 5 females = 10 colleagues.\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - John has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and John.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is part of both Sarah's and John's circles.\n\n4. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Sarah's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues (since she is part of Sarah's circle).\n   - In John's circle, Matilda has 4 female colleagues (since she is part of John's circle).\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider the overlap. Matilda herself is not counted as her own colleague, so we only count the other female colleagues.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of female colleagues in both circles, minus any overlap. However, since Matilda is the only overlap and she is not counted as her own colleague, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is simply the sum of the female colleagues in both circles.\n\nLet's calculate this: \n\n- Female colleagues in Sarah's circle: 5\n- Female colleagues in John's circle: 4\n\nSince Matilda is not counted as her own colleague, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n\\[ 5 + 4 = 9 \\]\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
