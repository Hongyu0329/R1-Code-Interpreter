    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sisters Bob's brother has. \n\nSince Patricia has 6 sisters, it means there are 7 girls in total (including Patricia herself). Patricia also has 4 brothers. Therefore, there are 4 boys in the family.\n\nBob is one of Patricia's brothers. Therefore, Bob's brother is also one of Patricia's brothers. Since all the brothers have the same number of sisters, Bob's brother has the same number of sisters as Patricia, which is 6.\n\nThus, the number of sisters Bob's brother has is 6.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
