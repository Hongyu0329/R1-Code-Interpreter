  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has, given the information about Linda's and John's circles of colleagues.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - 5 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague (excluding Matilda)\n   - Matilda is also part of Linda's circle.\n\n   Therefore, Linda's circle consists of 5 males + 1 female + Matilda = 7 people in total.\n\n2. **John's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 5 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n\n   Therefore, John's circle consists of 3 males + 5 females = 8 people in total.\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Linda and John, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n- In Linda's circle, Matilda has 1 female colleague (excluding herself).\n- In John's circle, Matilda is one of the 5 female colleagues.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is the number of female colleagues in John's circle, which is 5 (including herself).\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
