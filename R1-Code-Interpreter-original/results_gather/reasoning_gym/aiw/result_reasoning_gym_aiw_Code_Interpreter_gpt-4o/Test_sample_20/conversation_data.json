    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 7 colleagues (including Mary)\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 1 female colleague\n   - Total: 5 colleagues (including Thomas)\n\n3. **Matilda:**\n   - She is part of both Mary's and Thomas's circles.\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Mary and Thomas, she is the female colleague in Thomas's circle. Therefore, Matilda is the only female in Thomas's circle.\n\nNow, let's determine how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Mary's circle, there are 3 female colleagues (including Matilda herself).\n- Since Matilda is part of Mary's circle, she has 2 other female colleagues in Mary's circle.\n\nThus, Matilda has 2 female colleagues.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
