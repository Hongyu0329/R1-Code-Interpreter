    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 1 + 6 = 7 colleagues\n\n2. **William's Circle:**\n   - 3 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 3 + 3 = 6 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Jennifer's and William's circles.\n   - Since Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and William, she is counted in both circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jennifer's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n   - In William's circle, Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap:\n\n- Matilda is counted as a female colleague in both circles.\n- The female colleagues in Jennifer's circle (excluding Matilda) are 5.\n- The female colleagues in William's circle (excluding Matilda) are 2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- Matilda's female colleagues = (Female colleagues in Jennifer's circle excluding Matilda) + (Female colleagues in William's circle excluding Matilda) + Matilda herself\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Jennifer's circle excluding Matilda\nfemale_colleagues_jennifer_excluding_matilda = 6 - 1\n\n# Number of female colleagues in William's circle excluding Matilda\nfemale_colleagues_william_excluding_matilda = 3 - 1\n\n# Total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has\ntotal_female_colleagues_matilda = (\n    female_colleagues_jennifer_excluding_matilda +\n    female_colleagues_william_excluding_matilda +\n    1  # Matilda herself\n)\n\ntotal_female_colleagues_matilda\nassistant > Matilda has <<<8>>> female colleagues."
