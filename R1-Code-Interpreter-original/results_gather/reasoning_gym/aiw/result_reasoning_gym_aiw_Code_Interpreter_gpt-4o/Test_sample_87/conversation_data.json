  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - Total colleagues: 6 males + 5 females = 11 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is part of Jennifer's circle, so she is one of the 5 female colleagues.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Total colleagues: 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the only female colleague in Thomas's circle.\n\n3. **Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jennifer and Thomas.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both circles.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many female colleagues Matilda has:\n\n- In Jennifer's circle, there are 5 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n- In Thomas's circle, Matilda is the only female colleague.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, the female colleagues she has are the ones in Jennifer's circle (excluding herself).\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n5 (from Jennifer's circle) - 1 (excluding herself) = 4\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
