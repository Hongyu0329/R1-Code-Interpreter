    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sisters James's brother has. \n\nGiven:\n- Susan has 2 sisters and 2 brothers.\n\nThis means:\n- Susan is one of the sisters, so there are 3 sisters in total (Susan + 2 other sisters).\n- Susan has 2 brothers.\n\nSince James is one of Susan's brothers, James's brother is the other brother of Susan. Therefore, James's brother has the same number of sisters as Susan does.\n\nThus, James's brother has 3 sisters.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>"
