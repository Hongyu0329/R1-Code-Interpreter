  "question": "Sarah has 4 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to consider the circles of colleagues around Sarah and James, and the fact that Matilda is part of both circles.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 10 colleagues\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - 5 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 8 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Sarah's and James's circles.\n   - Since Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and James, she is counted in both circles.\n\nTo find out how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to consider the overlap and the unique members in each circle:\n\n- Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues in Sarah's circle.\n- Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues in James's circle.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to determine the unique female colleagues she has:\n\n- In Sarah's circle, excluding Matilda, there are 5 other female colleagues.\n- In James's circle, excluding Matilda, there are 2 other female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is the only person who overlaps between the two circles, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the unique female colleagues from both circles:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Female Colleagues of Matilda} = 5 + 2 = 7 \\]\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
