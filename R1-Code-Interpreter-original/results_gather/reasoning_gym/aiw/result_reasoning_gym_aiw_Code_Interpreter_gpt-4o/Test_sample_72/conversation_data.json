Michael has 1 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - 4 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 6 female colleagues\n   - Total: 1 male + 6 females = 7 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Connection:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Linda's and Michael's circles.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to find the overlap and determine the number of female colleagues she has.\n\n- In Linda's circle, Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues.\n- In Michael's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to consider the unique female colleagues she has. \n\nLet's calculate the number of female colleagues Matilda has by considering the overlap and unique members in both circles.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Linda's circle\nfemale_colleagues_linda = 3\n\n# Number of female colleagues in Michael's circle\nfemale_colleagues_michael = 6\n\n# Matilda is counted in both circles, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her\nunique_female_colleagues = female_colleagues_linda + female_colleagues_michael - 1\n\nunique_female_colleagues\nassistant > Matilda has <<<8>>> female colleagues."
