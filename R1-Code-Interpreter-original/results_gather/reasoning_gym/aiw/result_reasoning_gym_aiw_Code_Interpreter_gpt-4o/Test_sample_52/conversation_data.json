  "question": "Mary has 1 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Mary has. All these mentioned persons around Mary are colleagues of each other. Joseph has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female colleagues Matilda has, considering her unique position of being in both Mary's and Joseph's circles.\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - 1 male colleague\n   - 5 female colleagues\n   - Total: 1 + 5 = 6 colleagues\n\n2. **Joseph's Circle:**\n   - 6 male colleagues\n   - 3 female colleagues\n   - Total: 6 + 3 = 9 colleagues\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both circles.\n   - In Mary's circle, Matilda is one of the 5 female colleagues.\n   - In Joseph's circle, Matilda is one of the 3 female colleagues.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles, we need to count the unique female colleagues she has:\n\n- From Mary's circle, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues (since she is one of the 5).\n- From Joseph's circle, Matilda has 2 other female colleagues (since she is one of the 3).\n\nSince Matilda is the only person common to both circles, the female colleagues from Mary's circle and Joseph's circle do not overlap (except for Matilda herself).\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ (from Mary's circle)} + 2 \\text{ (from Joseph's circle)} = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
