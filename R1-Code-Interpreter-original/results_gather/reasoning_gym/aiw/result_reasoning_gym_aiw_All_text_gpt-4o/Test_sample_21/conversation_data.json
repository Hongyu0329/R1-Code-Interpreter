    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Friends:**\n   - Linda has 5 male friends.\n   - Linda has 6 female friends.\n   - Therefore, the total number of friends Linda has is 5 (male) + 6 (female) = 11 friends.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationship:**\n   - All of Linda's friends are friends with each other.\n   - This means each of Linda's friends is friends with the other 10 people (since there are 11 friends in total, including themselves).\n\n3. **Focus on Joseph:**\n   - Joseph is one of the 5 male friends of Linda.\n   - Since all friends are friends with each other, Joseph is friends with all of Linda's friends except himself.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Female Friends Joseph Has:**\n   - Joseph is friends with all 6 of Linda's female friends because they are all part of the same friend group.\n\nTherefore, Joseph, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 6 female friends of Linda.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
