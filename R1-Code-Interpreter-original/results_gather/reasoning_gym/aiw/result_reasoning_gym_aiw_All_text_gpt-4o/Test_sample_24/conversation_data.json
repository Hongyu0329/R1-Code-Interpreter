James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Sarah and James, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 4 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 4 males + 6 females = 10 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is part of Sarah's circle.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in James's circle = 5 males + 3 females = 8 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is part of James's circle.\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and James.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both Sarah's and James's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Sarah's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n   - In James's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n\n5. **Finding Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues she has.\n   - In Sarah's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 females, so she has 5 other female colleagues.\n   - In James's circle, Matilda is one of the 3 females, so she has 2 other female colleagues.\n   - However, since Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles, the other female colleagues in James's circle are not part of Sarah's circle.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 5 female colleagues from Sarah's circle.\n   - Matilda has 2 additional female colleagues from James's circle who are not in Sarah's circle.\n   - Therefore, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is 5 (from Sarah's circle) + 2 (from James's circle) = 7.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
