    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between the colleagues of Jennifer and Thomas, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Understanding Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Jennifer's circle consists of 6 males + 5 females = 11 colleagues in total.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Jennifer's circle.\n\n2. **Understanding Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Therefore, Thomas's circle consists of 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues in total.\n   - Matilda is the only female colleague in Thomas's circle.\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is part of both Jennifer's and Thomas's circles.\n   - In Jennifer's circle, Matilda is one of the 5 female colleagues.\n   - In Thomas's circle, Matilda is the only female colleague.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jennifer's circle, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues (since there are 5 females in total, including herself).\n   - In Thomas's circle, Matilda is the only female, so she has no female colleagues there.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues are only those in Jennifer's circle, excluding herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 4 female colleagues.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"
