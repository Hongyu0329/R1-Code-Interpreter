    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between Sarah's and John's colleagues, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 5 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Sarah's circle consists of 11 people in total (including Sarah herself).\n\n2. **Understanding John's Circle:**\n   - John has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, John's circle consists of 7 people in total (including John himself).\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and John.\n   - This means Matilda is part of both Sarah's and John's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Sarah's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - In John's circle, there are 4 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to determine if there is any overlap in the female colleagues between the two circles.\n\n5. **Overlap Consideration:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles.\n   - Therefore, the female colleagues in Sarah's circle and John's circle, aside from Matilda, do not overlap.\n\n6. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - From Sarah's circle, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues (excluding herself).\n   - From John's circle, Matilda has 3 other female colleagues (excluding herself).\n   - Since there is no overlap in the female colleagues between the two circles (except for Matilda herself), we add these numbers together.\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Total female colleagues of Matilda = 4 (from Sarah's circle) + 3 (from John's circle) = 7.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
