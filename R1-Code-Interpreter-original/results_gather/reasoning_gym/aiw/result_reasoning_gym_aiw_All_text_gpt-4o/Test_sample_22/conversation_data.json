All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. Joseph has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Jennifer and Joseph, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Jennifer's Circle:**\n   - Jennifer has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Jennifer's circle = 5 males + 3 females = 8 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Jennifer's circle.\n\n2. **Joseph's Circle:**\n   - Joseph has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Joseph's circle = 4 males + 4 females = 8 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Joseph's circle.\n\n3. **Overlap and Unique Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jennifer and Joseph.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jennifer's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n   - Therefore, the other female colleagues in Jennifer's circle are 3 - 1 = 2 females (excluding Matilda herself).\n\n5. **Joseph's Circle Analysis:**\n   - In Joseph's circle, there are 4 female colleagues, including Matilda.\n   - Therefore, the other female colleagues in Joseph's circle are 4 - 1 = 3 females (excluding Matilda herself).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 2 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle and 3 female colleagues from Joseph's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, the female colleagues from Joseph's circle are distinct from those in Jennifer's circle.\n\nTherefore, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of the distinct female colleagues from both circles: 2 (from Jennifer's circle) + 3 (from Joseph's circle) = 5 female colleagues.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>"
