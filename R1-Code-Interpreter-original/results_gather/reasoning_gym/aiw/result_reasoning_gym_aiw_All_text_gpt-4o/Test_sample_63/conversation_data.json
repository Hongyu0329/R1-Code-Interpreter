    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between the colleagues of Sarah and Thomas, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n   - All these colleagues are colleagues of each other.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 1 male colleague and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Thomas's circle = 1 male + 2 females = 3 colleagues.\n   - All these colleagues are colleagues of each other.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a part of both Sarah's and Thomas's circles.\n   - She is the only person who is a colleague of both Sarah and Thomas.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Sarah's circle, she has all of Sarah's colleagues as her colleagues.\n   - In Sarah's circle, there are 4 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Thomas's circle, she has all of Thomas's colleagues as her colleagues.\n   - In Thomas's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n\n5. **Overlap Consideration:**\n   - Matilda is counted in both circles, but we need to ensure we don't double-count her.\n   - Since Matilda is already counted as a female colleague in both circles, we need to consider the unique female colleagues she has.\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Sarah's circle = 4 (including herself).\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Thomas's circle = 2 (including herself).\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both, we need to subtract her once to avoid double-counting.\n   - Total unique female colleagues Matilda has = 4 (from Sarah's circle) + 2 (from Thomas's circle) - 1 (Matilda herself) = 5.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
