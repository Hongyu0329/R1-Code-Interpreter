    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Characters:**\n   - Linda has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n   - The male friends are Bob and another male friend.\n   - The female friend is not named, but we know she is a friend of Linda.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - All of Linda's friends are friends with each other.\n   - This means Bob is friends with the other male friend and the female friend.\n\n3. **Determine Bob's Female Friends:**\n   - Since Bob is friends with all of Linda's friends, and Linda has 1 female friend, Bob also has 1 female friend.\n\n4. **Consider the Constraints:**\n   - The problem states that they have no other friends aside from each other.\n   - Therefore, Bob cannot have any additional female friends outside of this group.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information given, Bob has exactly 1 female friend, who is the same female friend that Linda has.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the number of female friends Bob has.\n\n<<<1>>>"
