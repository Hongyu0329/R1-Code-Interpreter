    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between Linda's and Richard's colleagues, especially focusing on Matilda's connections.\n\n1. **Identify Linda's Colleagues:**\n   - Linda has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues of Linda = 5 males + 3 females = 8 colleagues.\n\n2. **Identify Richard's Colleagues:**\n   - Richard has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues of Richard = 2 males + 4 females = 6 colleagues.\n\n3. **Understand the Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Linda and Richard.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is included in both Linda's and Richard's circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Linda's circle, she has all of Linda's colleagues as her colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Richard's circle, she also has all of Richard's colleagues as her colleagues.\n\n5. **Count Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - From Linda's circle, Matilda has 3 female colleagues.\n   - From Richard's circle, Matilda has 4 female colleagues.\n   - However, since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we do not double-count her.\n   - Matilda herself is one of the female colleagues in both circles, so we need to subtract her from the total count.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Number of Female Colleagues for Matilda:**\n   - Total female colleagues from Linda's circle = 3 (excluding Matilda herself).\n   - Total female colleagues from Richard's circle = 4 (including Matilda).\n   - Since Matilda is counted in Richard's circle, we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting her.\n   - Total female colleagues for Matilda = 3 (from Linda) + 4 (from Richard) - 1 (Matilda herself) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
