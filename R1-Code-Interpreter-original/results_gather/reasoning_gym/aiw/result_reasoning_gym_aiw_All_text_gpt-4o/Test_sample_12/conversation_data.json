    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the information given:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Friends:**\n   - Sarah has 2 male friends and 4 female friends.\n   - Therefore, the total number of friends Sarah has is 2 (male) + 4 (female) = 6 friends.\n\n2. **Understand the Friendship Network:**\n   - All of Sarah's friends are friends with each other.\n   - This means each of Sarah's friends is friends with the other 5 friends.\n\n3. **Focus on John:**\n   - John is one of the male friends of Sarah.\n   - Since all friends are friends with each other, John is friends with the other 5 friends of Sarah.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Female Friends John Has:**\n   - Among the 5 friends John has, 4 are female (since Sarah has 4 female friends).\n   - Therefore, John has 4 female friends.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude the number of female friends John has.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"
