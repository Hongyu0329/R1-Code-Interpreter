    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Patricia and Charles.\n\n1. **Patricia's Circle:**\n   - Patricia has 6 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Patricia's circle consists of 6 males + 6 females = 12 colleagues in total.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Patricia's circle.\n\n2. **Charles's Circle:**\n   - Charles has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Charles's circle consists of 6 males + 5 females = 11 colleagues in total.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Charles's circle.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Patricia and Charles.\n   - This means Matilda is counted in both Patricia's and Charles's circles.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many female colleagues she has.\n   - In Patricia's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n   - In Charles's circle, there are 5 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n\n5. **Overlap Consideration:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only person who overlaps between the two circles, the other female colleagues in Charles's circle are not part of Patricia's circle, except for Matilda.\n   - Therefore, the female colleagues of Matilda are the ones in Patricia's circle, excluding Matilda herself.\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   - In Patricia's circle, there are 6 female colleagues.\n   - Excluding Matilda, there are 6 - 1 = 5 female colleagues.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
