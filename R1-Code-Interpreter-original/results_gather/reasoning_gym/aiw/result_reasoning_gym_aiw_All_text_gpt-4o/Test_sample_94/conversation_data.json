    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the information given:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Friends:**\n   - Margaret has 4 male friends and 2 female friends.\n   - Therefore, the total number of friends Margaret has is 4 (male) + 2 (female) = 6 friends.\n\n2. **Understand the Friendship Dynamics:**\n   - All of Margaret's friends are friends with each other.\n   - This means each of the 6 friends is friends with the other 5 friends.\n\n3. **Focus on Charles:**\n   - Charles is one of the 4 male friends of Margaret.\n   - Since all friends are friends with each other, Charles is friends with the remaining 5 friends.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Female Friends Charles Has:**\n   - Out of the 5 friends Charles is friends with, 2 are female (since Margaret has 2 female friends).\n   - Therefore, Charles has 2 female friends.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude the number of female friends Charles has.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
