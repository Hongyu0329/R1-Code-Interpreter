    "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - Margaret has 2 sisters and 1 brother.\n   - We need to determine how many sisters Charles's brother has.\n\n2. **Understand the family structure:**\n   - Margaret is one of the siblings. \n   - Margaret has 2 sisters, which means there are 3 sisters in total (including Margaret herself).\n   - Margaret has 1 brother.\n\n3. **Determine the total number of siblings:**\n   - Total siblings = 3 sisters + 1 brother = 4 siblings.\n\n4. **Identify Charles's position:**\n   - Since Margaret has 1 brother, and we are considering Charles's brother, Charles must be the brother of Margaret.\n   - Therefore, Charles is the brother in the family.\n\n5. **Determine how many sisters Charles has:**\n   - Since Charles is the brother, he has the same number of sisters as Margaret's brother.\n   - Margaret's brother (Charles) has 3 sisters.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Charles's brother (which is Charles himself) has 3 sisters.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
