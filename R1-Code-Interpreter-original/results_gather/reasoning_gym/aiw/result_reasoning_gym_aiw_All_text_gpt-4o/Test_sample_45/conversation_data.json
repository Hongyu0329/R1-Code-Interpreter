    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between the colleagues of Barbara and Michael, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Barbara's Circle:**\n   - Barbara has 2 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Barbara's circle consists of 5 people: Barbara herself, 2 male colleagues, and 2 female colleagues.\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - Michael has 1 male colleague and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Michael's circle consists of 5 people: Michael himself, 1 male colleague, and 3 female colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Barbara and Michael.\n   - This means Matilda is part of both Barbara's and Michael's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Barbara's circle, she is one of the 2 female colleagues in Barbara's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is part of Michael's circle, she is one of the 3 female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\n5. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Barbara's circle, Matilda has 1 other female colleague (since there are 2 female colleagues in total, including Matilda herself).\n   - In Michael's circle, Matilda has 2 other female colleagues (since there are 3 female colleagues in total, including Matilda herself).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 1 female colleague from Barbara's circle and 2 female colleagues from Michael's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is the only person common to both circles, the female colleagues from Michael's circle are distinct from those in Barbara's circle.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has a total of 3 female colleagues.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>"
