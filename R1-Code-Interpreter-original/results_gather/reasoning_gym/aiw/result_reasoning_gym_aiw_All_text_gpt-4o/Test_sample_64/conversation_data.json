    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Characters:**\n   - Alice has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n   - The male friends are Richard and another male friend.\n   - The female friend is not named, but we know she is Alice's friend.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - All of Alice's friends are friends with each other.\n   - This means Richard is friends with the other male friend and the female friend.\n\n3. **Determine Richard's Female Friends:**\n   - Since Richard is friends with all of Alice's friends, and Alice has 1 female friend, Richard also has 1 female friend.\n\n4. **Consider the Constraints:**\n   - The problem states that they have no other friends aside from each other.\n   - Therefore, Richard cannot have any additional female friends outside of this group.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Richard's only female friend is the same female friend that Alice has.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that Richard has exactly 1 female friend.\n\n<<<1>>>"
