    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between the colleagues of Sarah and John, particularly focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Understanding Sarah's Circle:**\n   - Sarah has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Sarah's circle = 3 males + 1 female = 4 colleagues.\n   - All these colleagues are colleagues of each other.\n\n2. **Understanding John's Circle:**\n   - John has 3 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 3 males + 2 females = 5 colleagues.\n   - All these colleagues are colleagues of each other.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Sarah and John.\n   - This means Matilda is part of both Sarah's and John's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Sarah's circle, there is 1 female colleague (which is Matilda herself).\n   - In John's circle, there are 2 female colleagues. Since Matilda is part of John's circle, she is one of these 2 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, the other female colleague in John's circle is not Matilda.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 1 female colleague in John's circle (other than herself).\n   - Since Matilda is the only female in Sarah's circle, she does not have any additional female colleagues from Sarah's circle.\n\nThus, Matilda has 1 female colleague.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
