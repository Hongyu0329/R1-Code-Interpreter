Joseph has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Joseph are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Joseph do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Joseph and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between the colleagues of Mary and Joseph, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Understanding Mary's Circle:**\n   - Mary has 1 male colleague and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Mary's circle consists of 1 male + 5 females + Mary herself = 7 people.\n   - All these people are colleagues of each other.\n\n2. **Understanding Joseph's Circle:**\n   - Joseph has 6 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Joseph's circle consists of 6 males + 3 females + Joseph himself = 10 people.\n   - All these people are colleagues of each other.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a part of both Mary's and Joseph's circles.\n   - She is the only person who is a colleague of both Mary and Joseph.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Mary's circle, there are 5 female colleagues (excluding Mary herself).\n   - In Joseph's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine if there is any overlap in the female colleagues between the two circles.\n\n5. **Overlap Consideration:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague in both circles.\n   - Therefore, the female colleagues in Mary's circle and Joseph's circle do not overlap, except for Matilda herself.\n\n6. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - From Mary's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n   - From Joseph's circle, Matilda has 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we do not double-count her.\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Total female colleagues of Matilda = 5 (from Mary's circle) + 3 (from Joseph's circle) = 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
