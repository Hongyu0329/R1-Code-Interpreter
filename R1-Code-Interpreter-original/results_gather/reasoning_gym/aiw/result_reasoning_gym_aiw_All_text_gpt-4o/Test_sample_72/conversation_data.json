Michael has 1 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Michael and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between Linda's and Michael's circles of colleagues, especially focusing on Matilda's connections.\n\n1. **Identify Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Linda's circle.\n\n2. **Identify Michael's Circle:**\n   - Michael has 1 male colleague and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Michael's circle = 1 male + 6 females = 7 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\n3. **Understand the Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Linda and Michael.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both Linda's and Michael's circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Linda's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 2 other female colleagues in Linda's circle.\n   - In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Female Colleagues for Matilda:**\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap between the two circles, the female colleagues in Linda's circle and Michael's circle are distinct except for Matilda herself.\n   - Matilda's total female colleagues = (2 from Linda's circle) + (5 from Michael's circle) = 7 female colleagues.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
