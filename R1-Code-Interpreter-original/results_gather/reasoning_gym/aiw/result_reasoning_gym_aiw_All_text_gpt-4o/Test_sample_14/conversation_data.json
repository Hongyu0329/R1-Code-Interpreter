    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Susan and James, and how Matilda fits into both circles.\n\n1. **Susan's Circle:**\n   - Susan has 5 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Susan's circle consists of 11 people in total (including Susan herself).\n   - Since all these people are colleagues of each other, each person in Susan's circle has 5 male and 5 female colleagues.\n\n2. **James's Circle:**\n   - James has 2 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, James's circle consists of 9 people in total (including James himself).\n   - All these people are colleagues of each other, so each person in James's circle has 2 male and 6 female colleagues.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a member of both Susan's and James's circles.\n   - In Susan's circle, Matilda is one of the 5 female colleagues.\n   - In James's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to determine how many unique female colleagues she has.\n   - In Susan's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues (including herself).\n   - In James's circle, Matilda has 6 female colleagues (including herself).\n   - Matilda is the only person who is part of both circles, so the overlap between the two circles is just Matilda herself.\n\n5. **Calculating Unique Female Colleagues:**\n   - To find the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has, we consider the females in both circles, excluding the overlap (Matilda herself).\n   - From Susan's circle, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues (excluding herself).\n   - From James's circle, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues (excluding herself).\n   - Since Matilda is the only common person, the total number of unique female colleagues is 4 (from Susan's circle) + 5 (from James's circle) = 9.\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 9 unique female colleagues.\n\n<<<9>>>"
