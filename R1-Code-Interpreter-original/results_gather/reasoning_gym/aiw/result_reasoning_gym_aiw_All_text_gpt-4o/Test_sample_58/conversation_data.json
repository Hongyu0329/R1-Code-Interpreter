    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and understand the relationships between the individuals mentioned.\n\n1. **Identify the Key Individuals:**\n   - Patricia: She has 5 sisters and 6 brothers.\n   - Joseph: We need to determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - Patricia's family consists of:\n     - 5 sisters (including Patricia herself).\n     - 6 brothers.\n   - This means Patricia is one of the 5 sisters, so there are 4 other sisters besides her.\n\n3. **Determine the Total Number of Siblings:**\n   - Total number of sisters = 5.\n   - Total number of brothers = 6.\n   - Total number of siblings in Patricia's family = 5 (sisters) + 6 (brothers) = 11.\n\n4. **Analyze Joseph's Relationship:**\n   - The problem asks about Joseph's brother. We need to determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has.\n   - Since the problem does not provide any additional information about Joseph's family, we assume Joseph is one of Patricia's brothers.\n\n5. **Determine the Number of Sisters for Joseph's Brother:**\n   - If Joseph is one of Patricia's brothers, then Joseph's brother is also one of Patricia's brothers.\n   - All of Patricia's brothers have the same number of sisters, which is 5.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Joseph's brother, being one of Patricia's brothers, has the same number of sisters as all the brothers in Patricia's family.\n\nTherefore, the number of sisters Joseph's brother has is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
