    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and understand the relationships between the individuals mentioned. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Individuals:**\n   - Sarah is the main individual mentioned.\n   - Joseph is another individual mentioned, but we need to understand his relationship to Sarah.\n\n2. **Understand the Family Structure:**\n   - Sarah has 2 sisters. This means there are 3 sisters in total, including Sarah herself.\n   - Sarah has 5 brothers.\n\n3. **Determine the Relationship Between Sarah and Joseph:**\n   - The problem does not explicitly state the relationship between Sarah and Joseph. However, it asks about Joseph's brother, which implies that Joseph is related to Sarah in some way.\n\n4. **Assume Joseph is One of Sarah's Brothers:**\n   - Since the problem asks about Joseph's brother, and Sarah has 5 brothers, it is reasonable to assume that Joseph is one of these brothers. This assumption is necessary because the problem does not provide any other context or information about Joseph's family.\n\n5. **Determine How Many Sisters Joseph's Brother Has:**\n   - If Joseph is one of Sarah's brothers, then Joseph's brother would also be one of Sarah's brothers.\n   - All of Sarah's brothers, including Joseph, would have the same number of sisters as Sarah does.\n   - Since Sarah has 2 sisters, Joseph's brother would also have 2 sisters.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the assumption that Joseph is one of Sarah's brothers, Joseph's brother would have the same number of sisters as Sarah does.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
