    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and understand the relationships between the individuals mentioned.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - Margaret has 2 sisters and 3 brothers.\n   - We need to determine how many sisters Robert's brother has.\n\n2. **Understand the family structure:**\n   - Margaret is part of a family with 2 sisters and 3 brothers.\n   - This means Margaret herself is one of the sisters, and she has 2 additional sisters, making a total of 3 sisters in the family.\n   - The family also includes 3 brothers.\n\n3. **Determine Robert's position:**\n   - Since the problem asks about Robert's brother, we need to identify who Robert is in this family structure.\n   - Given that Margaret has 3 brothers, Robert could be one of these brothers.\n\n4. **Analyze the question:**\n   - The question asks how many sisters Robert's brother has.\n   - If Robert is one of Margaret's brothers, then Robert's brother would also be one of Margaret's brothers.\n   - All of Margaret's brothers share the same number of sisters.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of sisters:**\n   - Since Margaret has 3 sisters in total (including herself), each of her brothers, including Robert, would also have 3 sisters.\n\nTherefore, the number of sisters Robert's brother has is the same as the number of sisters Margaret has, which is 3.\n\nFinal answer: <<<3>>>"
