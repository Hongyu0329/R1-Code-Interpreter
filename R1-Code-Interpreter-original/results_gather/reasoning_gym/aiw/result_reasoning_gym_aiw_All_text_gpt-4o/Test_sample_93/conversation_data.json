  "question": "Linda has 3 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between Linda's and Charles's circles of colleagues, focusing on Matilda's connections.\n\n1. **Identify Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 3 males + 5 females = 8 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is part of Linda's circle.\n\n2. **Identify Charles's Circle:**\n   - Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Charles's circle = 6 males + 2 females = 8 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is part of Charles's circle.\n\n3. **Understand the Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Linda and Charles.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both Linda's and Charles's circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Linda's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - In Charles's circle, there are 2 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is the only overlap, we need to consider the unique female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n5. **Calculate Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - Matilda is part of Linda's circle, so she has 5 female colleagues from Linda's circle.\n   - Matilda is also part of Charles's circle, but since the circles are separate except for Matilda, the 2 female colleagues in Charles's circle are not additional to the 5 in Linda's circle.\n   - Therefore, Matilda's female colleagues are the 5 from Linda's circle.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
