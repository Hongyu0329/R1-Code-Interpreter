    "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Family Structure:**\n   - Margaret has 4 sisters and 4 brothers.\n   - This means there are 5 girls in total (Margaret + 4 sisters).\n   - There are also 4 boys in the family (Margaret's brothers).\n\n2. **Identifying Bob:**\n   - Bob is one of Margaret's brothers. This is inferred because the problem asks about Bob's brother, and the only brothers mentioned are Margaret's.\n\n3. **Analyzing Bob's Family:**\n   - Since Bob is one of Margaret's brothers, he shares the same siblings as Margaret.\n   - Therefore, Bob has the same number of sisters as Margaret.\n\n4. **Counting Bob's Sisters:**\n   - As established, Margaret has 4 sisters. Since Bob is one of Margaret's brothers, he also has the same 4 sisters.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Bob's brother (who is also one of Margaret's brothers) would have the same number of sisters as Bob.\n\nTherefore, the number of sisters Bob's brother has is the same as the number of sisters Bob has, which is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
