    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and understand the relationships between the individuals mentioned.\n\n1. **Identify the individuals involved:**\n   - Elizabeth\n   - Elizabeth's sisters\n   - Elizabeth's brothers\n   - James\n\n2. **Understand the relationships:**\n   - Elizabeth has 5 sisters.\n   - Elizabeth has 4 brothers.\n\n3. **Determine the total number of siblings Elizabeth has:**\n   - Elizabeth herself is one of the siblings.\n   - Total siblings = Elizabeth + 5 sisters + 4 brothers = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10 siblings.\n\n4. **Identify James's relationship to Elizabeth:**\n   - Since James is mentioned in relation to Elizabeth's siblings, we need to determine if James is one of Elizabeth's brothers.\n   - If James is one of Elizabeth's brothers, then he is one of the 4 brothers.\n\n5. **Determine how many sisters James's brother has:**\n   - If James is one of Elizabeth's brothers, then James's brother would be another one of Elizabeth's brothers.\n   - All of Elizabeth's brothers have the same number of sisters, which is 5 (since Elizabeth has 5 sisters).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - James's brother, being one of Elizabeth's brothers, would have the same number of sisters as Elizabeth's other brothers.\n\nTherefore, the number of sisters James's brother has is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
