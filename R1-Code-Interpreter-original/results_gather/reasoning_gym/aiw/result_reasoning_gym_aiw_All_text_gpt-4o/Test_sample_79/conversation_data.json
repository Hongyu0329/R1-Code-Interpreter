David has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around David are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around David do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Linda and David, especially focusing on Matilda's connections.\n\n1. **Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 4 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 4 males + 2 females = 6 colleagues.\n   - All these colleagues are colleagues of each other.\n\n2. **David's Circle:**\n   - David has 4 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in David's circle = 4 males + 4 females = 8 colleagues.\n   - All these colleagues are colleagues of each other.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Linda and David.\n   - She is part of both Linda's and David's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Linda's circle, there are 2 female colleagues. Since Matilda is part of Linda's circle, she is one of these 2 female colleagues.\n   - In David's circle, there are 4 female colleagues. Since Matilda is part of David's circle, she is one of these 4 female colleagues.\n\n5. **Counting Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Linda's circle, Matilda has 1 other female colleague (since she is one of the 2).\n   - In David's circle, Matilda has 3 other female colleagues (since she is one of the 4).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 1 female colleague from Linda's circle and 3 female colleagues from David's circle.\n   - Since Matilda is the only person common to both circles, the female colleagues from David's circle are distinct from those in Linda's circle.\n\nTherefore, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is 1 (from Linda's circle) + 3 (from David's circle) = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
