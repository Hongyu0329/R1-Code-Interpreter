    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Jessica and Michael, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Jessica's Circle:**\n   - Jessica has 6 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Jessica's circle = 6 males + 1 female = 7 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the only female colleague in Jessica's circle.\n\n2. **Michael's Circle:**\n   - Michael has 5 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Michael's circle = 5 males + 6 females = 11 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is part of Michael's circle and is also part of Jessica's circle.\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Jessica and Michael.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Jessica's circle, Matilda is the only female, so she has no female colleagues there.\n   - In Michael's circle, there are 6 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, excluding Matilda, there are 5 other female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 5 female colleagues in Michael's circle.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
