    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and understand the relationships described.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - Alice has 2 sisters.\n   - Alice has 1 brother.\n\n2. **Understand the family structure:**\n   - Alice is one of the siblings.\n   - Alice's siblings include 2 sisters and 1 brother.\n   - Therefore, the total number of siblings Alice has is 3 (2 sisters + 1 brother).\n\n3. **Determine the total number of sisters:**\n   - Since Alice is one of the sisters, the total number of sisters in Alice's family is 3 (Alice + 2 other sisters).\n\n4. **Focus on Joseph's brother:**\n   - The question asks about Joseph's brother.\n   - The problem does not provide any direct information about Joseph or his family.\n   - However, the question is structured in a way that implies Joseph's brother is the same as Alice's brother.\n\n5. **Determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has:**\n   - Since Joseph's brother is the same as Alice's brother, we can use the information about Alice's family.\n   - Alice's brother has 3 sisters (Alice and her 2 other sisters).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Joseph's brother, who is the same as Alice's brother, has 3 sisters.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
